5,Perfect for handling summer heat!,1
1,"I am done with jewelry from Amazon.<br />The lengths are wonky (doesn't lay right), color off, cheap hardware and all around poor looking necklace. Direct from China.",0
1,"This is horrible. So cheap. Looks nothing like the picture. I ordered a small, I’m 5’6 112 lbs and it drowned me. Looked so bad on. They used a picture from the real dress on different sites that is about $45. Don’t waste your money.",0
3,Loved the fabric but item was too small. Return and reorder were simple.,0
1,Cheap fabric,0
1,"First of all the pattern is nothing like the picture. I was thinking that the material would be more along the lines of cotton and this is more the lines of polyester spandex because it's kinda shiny and very very stretchy. If you are really going for the look in the picture this is not the dress for you. I will be returning this one. But it is true to size. I ordered 1X based on the reviews and I am 5'7"",<br />205 my chest is A42D it fit perfectly but I just did not like the material nor the pattern.",0
4,"Cute, and comfy! Great quality and holding up nicely!",1
5,A bit lonG at the waist. These are the most comfortable panties I have worn in years .  Once they are on  I forget they are there. I am so happy to have foUnd them. Can't tell you how much $ has been wasted over the years looking for a comfo.rtable pair.  I have fibromyalaga and clothing is often annoying. I am ordering ordering more.,1
5,Very comfortable... fit as expected,1
5,This looked absolutely perfect with my bridesmaids dresses. They loved the bracelets and they looked so high quality.,1
5,cute and fun,1
5,"I LOVE these and wore them for the better part of a week,m. Not even exaggerating. Thick weight, cozy and warm. Well made. Love the “pop” of orange lining. I’m 5’8 & 160/165 lbs, I ordered a medium and they fit like a dream. A little extra bonus...I have 3 dogs who like to sit on my lap and worried about dog hair sticking to the pants, but that was not an issue at all! My one and only criticism is that I wish that they came in multiple colors because I would buy a different color for every day of the week!",1
1,This needs to be breezy and flow and the bottom. Instead it was tight and short. Runs very very small.  And the material is slippery. It bunched up and was tight when you sit in it.,0
5,Awesome shades! Thank you VZ,1
1,"Bought this cause my dermatologist said I probably have a nickel allergy. Pretty horrible buckle. It's just plastic. But it's nice because you can interchange with a different buckle and the Snaps are plastic (Xtra stars 4 that)<br />UPDATE...<br />The leather on this belt is really crappy. It just warps and I've only had it for like 6 weeks. I expected much better for $40. I'd like to enclose pictures so you can see what I'm talking about, but can't figure out how to do that.",0
5,Good quality!  Good size!,1
5,perfect it is for a gift and it is just what I was looking for,1
4,Maybe get a size up than your normal size. A bit tight in the shoulders. Goes well with just about any outfit.,1
1,Too small I returned this  I wear a 12 and ordered the large.  It did not fit,0
3,"Really neat looking pendant! The chain has a nice heft and box to it. My big issue was it arrived with a broken clasp ring. Not a huge deal, I figured a way to fix it, but it causes me to lack confidence in it staying on my neck.",0
5,It's perfect for my needs this summer,1
5,Very happy with my choice.  Really like that the kit has two anchor types.,1
5,Love it,1
3,[[ASIN:B01AIOBS62 Eason Eyewear Men's Designer Tear Drop Aviator Sunglasses 64 mm Brown/G15]] As for the design and quality I will have to give these a 2 thumbs up. They are very lightweight but yet are still sturdy and a great quality. The tint on these sunglasses is excellent for glare reduction and blocking the brightness of the sun. The main drawback I have is that the frame is slightly bigger than a normal pair of sunglasses which makes them look too big for my face. It is nice that they come in a silky cloth pouch to keep them in for protection and the included mini cleaning cloth is nice to keep them free of dust and light smudges. This product was purchased at a discount rate for the purpose of a true and honest review. I in no way received any type of monetary compensation for my true and unbiased review.,0
5,"Fits my daughter perfect, lots of compliments!",1
1,"Very thin material, cheaply made.",0
3,Liked pattern - not a good fit for my frame,0
3,Cheaper matetial. Product arrived with missing button on a pocket. Yet the shorts are very comfortable and are easy to pair with a graphic tee for a good look.,0
1,did not fit at all.,0
5,Easily adjustable. Washable. Holds a lot of junk.,1
3,Love this bracelet! I've been wearing it on and off for months!,0
2,Material is poor quality. Very stiff fabric,0
5,Nice & soft .. was too dressy for what I got it for ... but loved it so much couldn’t return it,1
3,Too loose and feels like they’re flat even though there’s an arch.,0
5,"I have an awkwardly shaped body and I'm fat to boot. Finding any dress that fits me is hard, but somehow this dress fits comfortably enough and  because of the slightly stretchy fabric it does not make me look like a sausage that's about to explode.  The color is true to the image as is the lace cut out and pearl buttons. I wish it were lined, but that would be too much to ask for considering the price. I will buy from them again.",1
2,This product is too small.  As another person wrote you cant put papers in that top pocket.  Or in my case my ipad is the larger 12.9 inch version and it wont fit.  The lower rating has to do with the page and how that isnt listed anywhere in THEIR description.  Though you can find it in the Q & A eventually had i seen that sooner i wouldnt have purchased the product.,0
1,Every 03 days i have to set the right tme.,0
1,Our son wears an 7- 71/2 boot and these do not fit at all.... way to tight in the front part of foot...,0
2,It already broke,0
4,Cups don't stay in place and you get very uncomfortable by the end of the day,1
2,Cute but not true to size by a long shot,0
4,"I purchased the dark grey dress in size medium.  For reference I am 5'5, 138 pounds, with a hip measurement of about 38-40 inches.  The color was more of a blue-grey.  It's a lovely color, just not what I was looking for.  The material is soft and stretchy.  I am returning only to get a different color and size large.  I don't like clothing to be too tight on my stomach (it has a bit of fluff that I like to conceal).  The way it sits on the body is nice, just a little too tight for comfort in my opinion.  It was not too short.",1
5,loved,1
5,"This 3-piece silvery bracelet set is so classy, it'll add elegance to any outfit for the perfect night on the town! Each bracelet is a thin piece of metal with a slight opening to fit your wrist through. I have very small hands and wrists, and it's a bit of a tight fit for me to squeeze into. I can tell that if you stretch the metal out a bit, it'll make a bigger opening, but I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to put stress on the bracelet.<br />Once on, they're lightweight and shiny. The one with the little balls on each end is my favorite, but the one with the leaves is also very cute.",1
5,Not too thick.. Very soft. Love the pattern. The zipper is great to hold cash or credit cards.,1
2,"The fit is good, but it began to fall apart almost immediately. Had to use clear tape to keep it together.",0
1,Fell apart first use. Smaller then appears. Looks cute and looks well made but is not. Handle fell off completely after first use with only a few clothing items in it at the time of use. Not worth the purchase.,0
1,"Definitely not true to size! Bought an XL as that is my normal size. The shirt is a belly shirt, maybe what should be a medium and shorts are maybe a large. Didnt even bother trying on bc it surely wont fit. Disappointed",0
5,Live these leggings,1
5,My wife really does like it.,1
3,Nice but the little bunny is just glue it.....,0
4,Great leg warmers for pole class. Material is not very soft. Washes well.,1
5,"This dress is beautiful,  thank you so much<br />Better than the picture",1
5,"Warm, comfortable and perfect for Harry Potter fans.",1
1,Material looks very cheap not as shown in the pic,0
3,"After a couple weeks, i began to see a metallic residue left on my fingers beside the ring. It may be from overuse as i loved the look, but it began staining my fingers. The fit was also too big even tho i got my size so i stuffed the hollow portion behind the head",0
5,I loved this purse but it was a little smaller then i expected other then that it was great!,1
4,Okay,1
4,It is a well made hat but I wish it was adjustable.,1
5,First time I buy a dress online. I was afraid it would not fit. I am 5'3 160lbs and a large fit me perfectly. Will add pic when I take pics this wkd,1
1,Does not have a kangaroo pocket as described.  The middle zipper is just for decoration.  Very loose fit,0
1,"Broke the first time I wore them. Great idea, bad craftsmanship.",0
5,Is there a My Little Pony Rainbow Dash obsessed toddler in your life? Than is a Must Have! Bright fun colors and softness they will want to wear 24/7. Adequate fabric and construction quality for a jammies costume.,1
1,"I don't usually post reviews, but this was the most cheaply made luggage I have ever seen. We recently purchased this set and were excited to have new luggage for our trip abroad. Unfortunately, not one of the pieces made it home intact. Before we even got started, we could tell the inside fabric was super cheap, and the zipper from the inside fabric divider broke off while packing. During travel, each case cracked right through the extremely thin plastic shell across the entire length, exposing a tiny sheet of foam that was left to hold in our clothes. The exterior zipper on the largest suitcase tore away from the plastic shell, and I'm surprised it didn't just break into two halves. This product is not sturdy enough to withstand airline baggage handling on even one single trip. The only saving grace was that Amazon let us return the set for a full refund.",0
5,"This is a beautiful purse!  I love purses but very particular.  Don't usually like to order them as I like to see them, and inspect them to make sure they will hold all the things I carry.  This one is perfect!  Very soft feel and looks like real leather.  Definitely looks like an expensive purse.  I would recommend highly.  Packaged very well too.  The turquoise color is exactly what I was looking for.  Very, very nice!!!",1
5,Very nice shirt and incredible price. My husband looks better in it than the model:),1
5,"This is very comfortable. This keeps me warm when it is cool (65 degrees) but when the temperature warmed up to 85, I wasn't sweating or hot at all even though it was sunny and I was golfing.",1
3,Pretty wallet with good storage! but the metal button part on the strap broke after 3 weeks of use so I can't secure it shut- not entirely happy about that.,0
4,Ordered for my pregnant sister to wear to funeral. She said it fits nice but the yellow is sort of see through,1
3,"I'm not a big guy and certainly not super muscular.  The sleeve cuffs are annoyingly tight.  The picture shows it, they ride up and hug your bicep very tightly, even for my thin size.  The shirt looks nice but be prepared for the fit on the arms.",0
3,"I wear a 16/xl but purchased this coat in a 1x since it was junior sized. While the arm length was good, the body of the coat was boxy and wide. I feel sizing down to an xl would only shorten the length/sleeves but do nothing the fit of the body. The coat is nice looking and well made, just awkwardly proportioned.",0
4,"The squirtle, charmander, and pokeballs looked great. Pikachu looked good in the picture but a bit off in real life. Also, bulbasaur was a darker shade of green than the one pictured. Overall, still a good purchase!",1
2,The skirt don’t look like that at all it’s long and lose the shirt does fit as expected tho,0
4,"This is a nice looking belt, and it's light weight and comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because two days after receiving my belt, two of the grommets fell out. It's not a big deal, the belt is still usable, but I would think the grommets would last longer than two days.",1
3,Fits right. I wear it instead of my boyfriend,0
2,"Not durable, frayed at buckle holes within days",0
1,Started to fall apart within an hour of wearing it. Had to change shirts before it completely gave way. The stitching where the fabrics meet are poorly done.,0
4,"I love the pendant it was exactly as pictured. However, the chain was not chain at all, it came with a fabric looking thing. So I couldn't give it five stars.  I decided to put in my car around my rearview mirror. Good daily reminder.",1
3,Nice warm coat but lightweight. The three stars are because the black tie is not as big as pictured but rather a thin strap and the side loops broke after only 2 days.,0
3,"Love the fleece, but i but tends to fit a bit awkward with the zipper after a while. The pockets are weirdly small and cannot hold much at all, almost useless functionality.",0
4,"Fabric is pretty thick, and it seems to shrink each time I wash it. I’ve had a lot of compliments on the message though.",1
5,"Arrived early, very nice bracelet but had to return size was to big",1
5,So cute and nice to wear with kids in tow,1
4,I bought this as a present for my mom. She loves it. Was shipped fast. I give 4 stars because I have yet to know how it will hold up to normal wear and tear. Looks nice though!,1
3,This earrings are small more so for kids,0
1,"We have had these sunglasses before but this pair broke the very first time my husband wore them. He was at a tennis match, took them off to wipe his face and the bow broke off. Had no back up pair.",0
5,"This is an excellent quality pair of slippers.  Nice leather and lining.  I especially appreciate the thick sole and aggressive tread so that I don't have to be afraid on the stairs.  I normally wear a size 10 1/2 shoe, so I bought size 11 slippers.  They're a little large but not dangerously so, and I doubt that a size 10 would have been big enough.",1
1,Hoops are cheaply put together. Very unhappy.,0
2,Item received did not look like item in photograph.,0
2,"These run a little small and after only a month, they are ripped. I bought them as a gift and was disappointed in their quality.",0
5,Great just love it,1
1,Zippers were stuck/broken upon arrival. Had to return as it was inoperable.,0
3,"These earrings are cheaply made. However they are cute. I do not like the material of the tassels on the hoop style earrings at all, so I will give them away or toss them. The other earrings have tassels that are made of a silky strands of material so they hangs nicely. Also, I will have to secure the tassels to the metal portion with fabric glue or something similar. When removing them from the packaging, one of them came out.",0
5,I actually bought this for airport travel. It was the best in transit.,1
3,"Regarding my purchase of the Manitou lightweight frameless sunglasses, I have mixed feelings. The design, look and fit of the glasses are excellent which make me want to like them a lot. However, I just can't get used to the lenses. They are too dark and the clarity is lacking. I can only wear them on very bright, sunny days and even then the vision could be better.",0
1,Photos on Amazon look nothing like the product I received. The lace in from doesn’t lay nice and looks cheaply down together the back is super short and it’s so wide that it’s probably two sizes to large. I’m a small and this wasn’t anywhere close to a small. I’ll be returning this shirt.,0
4,Bottoms were a little loose,1
2,"I am a C Cup and ordered a C Cup.  When it arrived, I had to give it to my teenage daughter to wear.",0
2,These are great for kids not break or scratch new glasses but sadly 2 came unusable.,0
5,Amazing quality and very nice packaging.,1
3,These very thin socks fit fine on the foot itself but the toes are really thin and tight.  It's hard to get the toes which leaves the toes feeling strangled for a time. There is also extra room at the top of each toe.  Eventually they stretch and mold but it's not an easy start.  The non-slip foot pads could be a little bigger for a better grip.,0
3,It seems to be fully polyester and it makes me sweat at the waist band. It is really shiny fabric.,0
4,My daughter loves this watch band,1
5,"These are the greatest fleece sweatpants I have ever purchased.  The sweatpants are warm and comfy.  I am 5'9"" and I weigh around 200 lbs.  I purchased the XXL as I like my sweats a little bigger.  I am considering buying at least another pair.",1
3,I do not know that I received these! Soon maybe,0
1,"I just am not happy with this product (housecoat) as in my view it was poorly made & so not as described by the seller.  Returns are a hassle here, and so sadly for me I am just out the money I spent here, but a lesson I did learn the hard way, but still a lesson learned is a good thing. Enough said.",0
2,These are poorly made and uncomfortable. I wish I’d sent them back.,0
1,I'd u get one of these that has an offset color sewn into the outside of the straps. The way those are sewn. They sit way different than the solid color strapped one. Solid colar strap is a man shirt. Sewing design of the others makes them sit very oddly.,0
2,"The hat is super small, and the lining is &#34;Polyester,&#34; not &#34;Satin!&#34;",0
1,No stretch. I ordered yellow and was shipped Grey. Not a good buy.,0
1,Not comfy. Standard cheap plastic you hate in your mouth can be sharp on edges... regrets,0
3,"A lil snug fit... but overall.. they fit well n arent TOO warm, which was something i was worried about.",0
1,"The item looks nothing like the picture, I over paid for a item that am not happy with. The iron on looks bad on the t shirt",0
5,Best watch,1
3,"Heavier than expecte, looks nice.",0
5,"I ordered the med large for my 11yr old  grandson,( big boy for 11)  it had to be returned , it was a bit to long and to big in the shoulders, I reordered the small. it was a great fit except for the arms, with a little hemming, it turned out to be a sporty style jacket he loves. He looks so handsome in his new jacket, he wears a white t-shirt style shirt with it. looks great!  This is a light weight material and made well. I would recommend this.",1
5,Too Clean And HD Clear.... Love Em.!!!,1
5,Very cool mask design. Fit's my teen son great. He loves it and every time he wears it some one asks him where he got it and most importantly for a teen...It's soooo cool!!! Even goes with his school uniform and school colors.,1
2,"Incredibly disappointed. The sizing is quite misleading. I'm a standard 40 on the waist, all around brand-wise and these didn't fit whatsoever. This is the problem with buying online, never know what you're getting at and you have to &#34;depend&#34; on brands to accurately represent sizing.<br /><br />If you're a 40, go 44 or larger.<br /><br />Quality seems nice, but I've got to make 2 or 3 New Year's Resolutions before I will ever get to enjoy them.",0
5,Awesome find! Exactly as described & as photographs - these will get plenty of wear!,1
1,Dislike everything,0
5,and the print is pretty.,1
1,"This worked great when it did. Less than a month after purchase, the shock function no longer works. Disappointing especially at this price.",0
2,"color is good, but the screw came out and I  almost lost the key to my vehicle: luckily it fell inside my vehicle. kind of a waste of money, because it’s useless without the screw to hold the key.",0
5,Excellent!!!  Was a gift.,1
4,"Has a cotton lining so that was good. The quality is ok, for some reason I expected it to be better but it is still very pretty when it’s in. Doesn’t come with bloomers but definitely needed some. Dress was short and basically came down right to the crotch. It’s a typical dress length which come with bloomers. I just put some in her that I had and it worked perfectly. Super cute and got allot of complements.",1
5,"LOVE! Great quality for the price. I'm 5'3 140, ordered the xl & I'm happy I did. It covers my post (2) baby tummy, but is still has a fitted shape (looser at the bottom & slightly fitted in the rib/waist area)",1
4,"Can't hardly see the date and the altitude can be off by 250 feet or so. Probably not worth 200 bucks. The lighting sucks too, two leds shine halfway across the screen. Not back lit. Crappy band too. But can be replaced with any 22mm.",1
1,Fits smaller than expected,0
5,Fits great!,1
2,"Its new, doesn't appear to have been worn, but there is a liquid stain in it. I checked it's on the mask itself. I needed it in 2 days. So I'll wash and sanitize it. If stain doesn't come out most DEFINITELY returning it.",0
5,Really fun!,1
1,I woke up suffocating. Ripped it off so I could breath.  Not cool.,0
5,"Wife loves it, great for evenings, fits in her clutch.",1
5,"paying $73.00 for a pair from the doctor. These work as well if not better , look good and go on refectly. Definitely a real value. Hope they last!!!",1
1,The boxes where full of mold . It was terrible. They smelled so bad. I had to throw away the boxes . And the writing is so light  you can hardly read what it says .  Very disappointed.,0
1,Great cut but itchy fabric,0
4,I was looking for something to wear to protect me from the hot hot hot sun!! I was very curious to see how this item worked. I received it in a timely manner and was able to use it immediately. I wore the item for a week all day. This did include at work and I do a lot of moving around. I was happily surprised to learn that it did indeed seem to keep my arms cool. I was also amazed that it kept me warm in my office. I usually have to wear a jacket because of how cold it is in there and I look ridiculous wearing a jacket in the middle of 105 heat. The only complaint I have is that with so much movement the top of the sleeve would roll down. I would have to adjust it a couple of times during the day but it was worth it. I am still using it daily and it protects me from the heat.,1
5,"great scarf, museum gift shop quality!",1
3,The band is very dressy and I loved the looks of it with my fit bit.  I found the clasp doesn't hold very well and it has dropped off my wrist.  I have gone back to my original band because I was afraid of losing it.,0
5,I love it feels awesome,1
3,Cute hat but runs big. My son has a large head for his age and the xs/s is still to big.,0
2,ordered a large and i think its a children's size,0
4,Love the look of the pants.  Does as expected except that they are pretty long. Great quality material.,1
3,"These gloves are comfortable and easy to put on and off, but they are not warm",0
5,"CUTE!!! Even the beads are Obsidian!  Will be a nice piece to wear in winter over a sweater, will make a good conversation necklace. Plan on getting another in a different color for my granddaughter for a gift.",1
5,amazing,1
1,"I ordered two of these dresses, and the black one fit well, but the blue (same size) fit awkwardly. Unfortunately, I missed the return window so I'm stuck with it.",0
3,Smaller than expected.,0
4,"There's so much good that I really like. Love the colors, durable frames, really great springy bow hinges, good placement of the bifocal placement in the lenses. So much is so good, but... all four of mine have a second, contrasting color above each eye.",1
5,I love it,1
5,"Love it! Sexy, comfortable and hides my mommy pouch well making me feel good and pretty.",1
5,"should have gone down one size, but is good for what I am using them for.",1
5,I really like this apron. I’m an artist and use it to keep paint off my clothes.<br />This apron is well built and comfortable. It’s gotten to the point I feel naked without it.,1
5,These socks were for my husband. He likes them. He says they are comfortable.,1
3,Garment is decent....OK.,0
5,I've bought several brands of compression socks to wear while flying or being on my feet all day. These are by far my favorite! They fit well and they stay up.,1
1,Exactly wat i wanted,0
1,This product is a scam and should be removed from the market. It quit operating correctly within weeks of receipt. I will not buy another product of this nature from Amazon!,0
1,garbage!  It’s not even ok for donation. Cheap fabric and poorly sewed. Junk and waist of money.,0
1,"Doesn't lift, doesn't fit😯 I have worn a 36b for a few years and never ever has this happened.. DON'T PURCHASE!",0
2,"The quality and fit are beautiful, but this is NOT burgundy. It’s bright red. If red was the color for class then this would be a winner, unfortunately the color for class is BURGUNDY. Which is what I thought was being ordered. This is marked as a women’s size medium and fits my 10 year old perfectly. Measurements are 33, 26, 33, girth 55. I would say it definitely runs small, lol.",0
5,"I love the color, it looks classic and elegant.",1
1,Not the best.,0
3,Not true to size,0
4,"Review for: YEEPSYS Women's Pants Bubble Hip Butt Lifting Anti Cellulite Legging High Waist Workout Tummy Control Yoga Tights<br /><br />These pants are made of a ruched and stretchy fabric that I don’t really care for but they fit like they were made for me and they feel great. As far as the butt lifting feature, that part is certainly not happening but then I didn’t really expect it to. The tummy control part is a bit effective and works like most tummy control clothing, it is a bit tight around the belly. The length is good for me and I am 5’ 6”.<br /><br />Anyone that can live with ruched fabric will probably like these. I will wear mine at home, with a long shirt.",1
5,Adorable dress for my daughters puppy themed birthday. Well made,1
2,Came very wrinkled. Not enough bust room. I returned it.,0
5,Very nice,1
5,Perfect for Volleyball games!,1
3,"This skirt was ok. The top of the skirt hit around my waist, which was too big. The butt and thighs area was too tight, and it was too short. Sent back.",0
5,Love the jacket just too small. Read all the reviews figured it would fit me but doesn't. Will be returning but ordered a medium!,1
3,"The socks are varying lengths, with one pair reaching higher than the others. The dark colors are thin and can be a bit see through near the thighs.",0
5,My daughter loved it!!!,1
5,Fit as expected. Good quality. Colors true.,1
4,I'm wearing it now. Nice hat with lining inside that makes it more comfortable than your average hat and I think the logo is reflective which is cool. The only thing I didn't like was that there's a lot of holes punched into the Velcro and one of the holes ripped where the fabric was thin.,1
1,So cheap. Don't waste your time and money.,0
4,"I like them so far, it's going to take some time to break them in.",1
4,Nice top. I think it is juniors. Got a 2x and it flows nicely— just right. Would recommend going up two sizes for nice fit.,1
1,Very poor quality and cheap material,0
3,Too hot for beach days. Wore once. Cute but not for really hot weather. Fabric doesn't breathe.,0
5,Dress came in quickly. Packaging was intact. Purchased as a present. Unsure if  it will hold up for many washes. Very soft and lightweight.,1
5,I love this kit and going to keep buying it👌🏼,1
5,Product as described.,1
3,The blue looks much darker (very dark navy) in real life and it makes the black of the penguins hard to see.,0
1,I normally wear a size large (womens 8-10) but ordered this in a 2xl so it would fit loose...I can barely get it on!,0
5,Sexy look,1
2,We ordered a size 10-12 and received size 6-9,0
5,Love it,1
5,Buy one size up after washing they will shrink to the next size smaller I washed with cold water and delicate dry and they shrunk to the perfect size I'm a 36 waist in levis so I ordered these in xxl,1
5,"It is a lovely necklace, of a unique design, and it is going to turn heads where ever you wear it. I have only worn it once so far and I got several complements on it and people asking where I got it. The shipping was fast, and the necklace is well made by a respectable company. I have bought from the &#34;Alchemy&#34; lines before and they truly are a great product.",1
5,"Perfect fit. They are everything that your website described. Very happy I found them on Amazon.<br />The case is also great. Also, great pricing.",1
2,"It’s actually very cute on, and fit pretty good except for the bust.  I’m a 36C and ordered a large and the ladies did not fit in the cup.  But I could get past all of that if it weren’t for the blatantly cheap material!!  It was like wearing paper!  I’d rather just pay more money for better quality because I’ll NEVER be comfortable around a lot match in this dress",0
5,They change colors and synchronize I love it especially when I’m VIBING!!!,1
4,It’s very easy to wear and soo soft,1
5,"I just love it. It's weird and funny and shouts ""I enjoy life!"".  It's stylish and we'll made. It's really heard, quite impossible, to iron though.<br />I am 5'9 and 134lbs and I love how it fits.",1
4,you can’t beat it for the price,1
1,I ordered several apirs of lounge pants due to losing 40 pounds! This is a KNOCK OFF Company! While 1 pair fit perfect... the 2nd pair was 2 sizes too SMALL?????  GGRRRRRRR. NOT HAPPY!  Will NOT order from this company again ever!,0
5,I like the fit when I tried it on haven’t got to wear it out yet,1
4,The wallet arrived swiftly.<br />The suggestion I have for the creator of this product is to expand the accordion pleats so the wallet opens to 180* to facilitate getting to the credit cards.,1
2,The dress is beautiful however you can see through the dress.,0
2,One of the pins came to me with the stem potion that clips broken. I am assuming this was due to weak points in addition to poor packaging.,0
5,This lil dress is even cuter in person! And it fits!! I don't have much luck w ordering clothes online but this dress fit perfect!,1
5,Nice purse and seems to be well made.  Very stylish.  Lots of room inside and not too big. Dressy purse,1
2,"Fabric advertised on website and label as 95% rayon and 5% spandex. However, the fabric is definitely made of polyester, and it pills and loses color after one wash. I bought three dresses from this brand. Two of them had the same issue. They were the ones with patterns. Only the solid color one is as advertised on the site and the label (95% rayon and 5% spandex).",0
2,The top was a little too small if you have a full chest.  Also if you have full chest then you will definitely have a side breast problem which I don't like.  The bottoms were too big. The design was pretty but not enough to overcome the architectural problems of the suit for women with larger breast size.,0
1,This was not what was expecting. Wouldn't recommend this item to anyone.  Came quickly just not happy with my purchase.,0
1,They will turn your ears green,0
1,"Unfortunately I need a thicker quality of dress. Cheap piece of cotton, not worth my purchase.",0
5,They are great fitting cute trendy comfy footwear that I can wear and walk in all day. I also have the blush color. Love these,1
5,Good Quality and fits great,1
1,"La máscara no es para adorno, y esta no cubre nada,  es demasiado fina. Se pega mucho a la piel. No las devolví porque mi nieta las usó para vestir las muñecas. No las recomiendo.",0
5,I was looking for something nice and not too big as I have very small wrists and this fit perfect!! They also provided the tool to take out the links which made it so much easier to change the size of the band. I would definitely recommend this watch!!,1
5,They have helped my legs feel less tired after 14 hours on duty,1
1,Poor quality,0
5,These are great,1
5,Bought this as a gift and it was well received. Beautiful necklace and the statement is heart felt. Highly recommend for that special friend who's been there for you through everything.,1
3,"shows bright white, it's more like creame.",0
4,"I bought the socks as a gift and so far so good. She loved the designs, colors, and how they kept her feet warm these past few mornings and evenings. Although not a 100% wool, it’s ok. They’re doing their job and I’m fine with that. If they wear out, it’s ok because I can replace them because they are also affordable.",1
5,I usually only buy cotton because i really hate how much cheap synthetic fabric pills after one wash or wearing once. And most of the sweaters i see on here are just that. This is synthetic but it holds up very well to washing and wearing. Worth the price,1
5,This outfit is too cute!!! Quality is great as well! Sizing is exact!,1
2,"While they look nice and are sturdy, I have to pull the bar in and out to get the earrings open because the clip it too tight. It is a pain, even though &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; I have had better earrings for the same price.",0
5,This is adorable.  It matches my petite rose gold band perfectly and looks beautiful.  Great quality for the money.  It sparkles great.  I'm totally in love.,1
5,My daughter loves the butterflies on them.,1
1,"The face shield on this hat is not a rigid plastic like it appears in the picture.  It’s more like a clear vinyl that you would stretch over an umbrella frame, so it just hangs off the hat, bumpy and wrinkly.  The shield is also not very long, it just barely came down to my 3yo’s chin.  I can’t foresee how it would help to keep her droplets to herself.",0
2,"First off the material used was very nice, however it wasn't like a typical jersey, it felt more like a wind breaker. I also liked the pattern and the colors were what really drew me to this jersey. 5/5 on looks.<br />The 2 star rating was for them sending me the long sleeve version, which I didn't want. I wanted the short sleeve one, which is what I purchased. Also, I have only bought medium jerseys for the last 10 years and they have always fit. I am 5'10 /140lbs. This was really very tight, had no wiggle room, and did not feel like any medium I have ever worn. I got 2 other medium jerseys the same week and they both fit fine. I did return it and got a refund.",0
1,Strap broke on plane,0
5,"Lovely piece, looks prettier in person.",1
5,"Love it.  Does stretch out a bit over time, but I just relighted it up again. Love the colors",1
5,I get so many compliments on this shirt! Love it!,1
4,Was large and comfy. Did shed black fibres on my coat but was able to cover my face and keep me warm and that was the most important thing.,1
2,Way too small.  I even check the chart but was deceeved.  Probably my fault,0
3,"nice product but runs small,  order 2 sizes larger",0
3,The band is a little weird I have a very tiny wrist so the magnetic strip goes all the way up to the very top of my watch the blingy cover was so pretty got lots of compliments but you do have to take off the cover to charge the phone which is a pain every single time after a couple uses the watchband got discolored and was not pretty anymore luckily didn’t pay very much for this throw it all in the trash.,0
1,Reused shipping package and product arrived 1/4 used. See photos.,0
5,"Me agrado mucho, pero la talla es muy chica",1
2,I don't understand why this shirts is made of a different fabric and is a different size from another color.,0
4,Fit is good but it was a little loose at the wrist. It seems to do the job though! Bright vivid pattern. Would buy again!,1
4,Cool but bigger than you think,1
1, ,0
5,Very happy with product.,1
5,10/10 amazing to clean my yezzy boost 350 v2s,1
5,I love these shirts. I’ve worn one everyday to the gym since I received them. The hood is pretty big but not too bad. Doesn’t shrink after washing and drying. Tie a knot in the strings before washing or they might come out in the wash. I’m 5’9” and 180 lbs…large fit perfect.,1
3,"I love a buffalo check for fall and winter so was excited about this. Unfortunately, it’s not very practical for me fit wise. While this will look cute with jeans or a mini with tights, it’s not going to keep you warm and the sleeves are a bit wide and bulky to wear with a sweater or light jacket. This shirt is a thin, kind of slick viscose fabric.<br /><br />I’m between a small and medium and normally take a medium in flowy shirts. This shirt is deceptive as it’s not really loose (as shown on model) unless you’re very petite or size up. I’m a 36B and this is a bit restrictive in the bust and upper arms. The fitted bust area and boxy shape make it hitch up when you lift your arms so your stomach will show.<br /><br />The strip of crochet really adds to the style and I think this would be very cute if it was less fitted up top. If you’re small on top or size up, I’d recommend.",0
4,"Cute dress. If you’re busty you might want to order a size up. Other than that, it has a nice weight to it. I got bleach on mine by accident so I’ll be ordering another one",1
5,"This coat is so warm, I had to bought 2 sizes bigger than mine but it fits perfectly",1
1,"I bought this outfit in size (L). Because I’m a large. Biggest mistake everrrrr. This thing is like a sailboat on me, you could fit 10 people in it. There size chart isn’t true to size at all. Please sisters buy two sizes down from your size. Thank me later.",0
1,the wood flaked off the earring and had rough edges and the wooden pin broke almost instantly after putting the earrings on.<br />Crap would Not BUY this again.,0
4,It's a classy nice fit. I love the style. It's just what I expected. Thank you!,1
3,"I received my dress on time, was very excited when it came only to see a hole in it. Very disappointed. On the positive side it does fit according to the size chart. I'm 38DDD bust, 36 waist and 41 inches hip, i ordered a large it fit perfectly. Unfortunately i cannot wear it",0
3,These require ironing and smell odd even after a few washes. They are comfy though.,0
3,I bought this one size down; i'm returning it for 2 sizes down as I do not prefer my tops to be extra roomy.<br />The top material is thin and a weave pattern.  I plan on wearing it on cool spring/summer nights.,0
1,Bags rip open easily.....very poor quality,0
1,The appearence of these earrings are VERY disappointing! They look VERY Cheap and I would NOT recommend them to Anyone!,0
5,My grandson has a high instep and these fit perfect..They look great and he likes them..,1
5,My mom loved it. Very pretty in person,1
2,"I actually loved these pants. The fit was great, they were long enough (I'm 5'9) and they were super comfy. I'd give 5 stars, but I only washed them twice and the stitching started to come out and there was a hole because the stitching came undone. I've only owned them a month. I might consider buying a new pair because they're so comfortable, but I don't want to be throwing away my money.",0
3,"Love this dress! It fits really well - at 5'8&#34; and 145 pounds I bought a medium and the fit was perfect. The fabric is thin enough to be cool when wearing but isn't so thin that you can see through it. The dress is adorable!<br /><br />Update: I have now had to return 2 of these dresses because the elastic breaks in the shoulders the first time wearing it. Too bad, it's a cute dress, but I won't be re-ordering.",0
5,Love these earrings wear them every day great quality not cheap at all. Also i get many compliments on the.,1
1,Too small and tight fitting,0
2,"The only reason I was willing to pay over $70 for a made in China item is because it clearly states DOWN in the title. When you get it in real life, you will see  It is 100% polyester. What is with the top 1000 amazon reviewers not even touching on this?<br /><br />*not warm. I tend to run hot (I'm usually hot), wore this outside in the high 40s, low 50s and was cold. I had a fleece, leggings underneath and was wearing boots.<br /><br />*not down. I'm really sick of ads blatantly lying. I just bought a hat on amazon advertised as 100% wool and I open it up and tag shows it is mostly poly. This ad says down, and tag  in person says 100% poly.<br /><br />*overprices for being 100% poly.<br /><br />*hood is cosmetic only. It is dramatic and beautiful bc it's so large but the slightest wind knocked this right down the very first time I wore it for a test run.  It wasn't even an extreme wind. Imagine how this would perform on a windy day? There is nothing to secure the hood (no snaps, no strings) so it doesn't stay up - and it also completely obscures your peripheral vision.<br /><br />*no waist definition. Look at the widest part of your body. for me it's the hips. Since this has no waist definition, it will create a box shape on your body, as wide as the widest part of your body. It looks like a giant shapeless sack.<br /><br />*not puffy - not much filling, and flat - so it's not warm.<br /><br />*great length. The other vest I tried on seemed to be much thicker and more shapely and flattering, but short. This has a great length and keeps your arms free and covers your bum if you're wearing leggings, even if you're tall.<br /><br />But since the sellers have no qualms about lying to your face about the material and grossly overcharging for polyester, and since it's not warm nd has no functional hood and is shapeless and not flattering, I am returning. I do love the length and wish there were more options out there. I might have kept this for warmer winter days and cinch a belt on it if it were cheaper and didn't lie in the ad.",0
5,"Very pretty and I got lots of compliments when I wore it. As others stated,it is quite flow and large.",1
5,I just got this in the mail today but I already love it.  It is the perfect size and my passport and cards fits just right.  The leather is soft and looks really nice.  I am happy that I chose the one with the clasp and the money pockets.,1
4,Love the amount of room and pockets,1
5,My favorite hat. Love Lucky Brand. Color is a little off Tennessee orange.,1
1,"This was a special purchase for a dressy occasion, after 6 hours my ankle turned green!  Also, it was supposed to extend to 11"" and did not. The metal is cheap and tacky looking.  Don't buy this.",0
5,"I loved this belly button ring. It is great for the price! I had it on for months, showering, working and working out with it. After a while the back part did turn a rust color, but what do you expect from a belly button ring that is only a couple dollars? Plus the front still looked perfect. I am ordering another one now after it finally gave out on me. But I expected it to break long ago.",1
3,"This was an okay purchase.<br />Sleeves were way too tight, besides that, it was cute!",0
1,"Doesn't look like picture, returned...",0
4,"Really like how it looks on my timex, putting it on wasn’t that bad just wish it had that little mechanism in the strap where you just pull it back and you can release the strap but overall still good.",1
5,"Just FYI the Medium Size is pretty roomy. I use this over a denim backpack, your standard one-big-pocket Jansport size. Works great and love the bright color. Keeps my pack dry and me visible!",1
1,Cheap thin material. Runs very small. Shirt length is short. Ankle closer is very tight and uncomfortable,0
3,"good, very durable, excellent product",0
2,Thank you for the easy way to return!,0
1,The color was pretty it matched my Purple 12 but the band didn’t fit properly at all so I returned it.,0
5,My daughter loves her infinity scarf. Thanks!,1
1,I’ve seen better pieces of jewelry come out of a gum ball machine. Even for the money it’s the worst. It’s definitely going back. Very very disappointed!,0
1,They were not even the same style of glasses as the picture. Very cheap and flimsy. Would not record buying these.,0
2,Too small. Returned,0
4,"Very pretty, but needs to be hand washed.",1
1,"The product description explicitly states that this is a replacement lens for the Bollé Edge 2 sport glasses. I purchased both the emerald and the blue replacement lens. Please be aware that it DOES NOT fit the Bollé Edge 2 frame. The lens is too wide. Other than that, they seem to be a nice replacement lens for something else.",0
5,Pretty awesome! My girlfriend loves it!!,1
2,Cozy but the fabric pulls way too easy causing it to have snag lines.,0
5,"These are so cute I can't even. I've always paid attention to the YRU brand, I guess Cute to the Core is the sister brand. I love unicorns and I've been converting over to only purchasing vegan materials, so I was pretty excited to get these. They're ridiculously cute. I am a 7-7.5 and they fit perfectly, albeit a little narrow but I'm hoping that doesn't cause too much discomfort. Overall, the cutest shoes I own right now.<br /><br />I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
1,runs very small and thin material - not as pictured at all,0
5,Cute.,1
5,Rocks were a big hit and having them white made it so easy to paint on!! We used the acrylic paint pens and they worked out great!!,1
2,It is  too heavy for my use. I returned the bag.,0
1,I hate that they don't use regular sizes. Who freaking measures their kids? This was annoying to purchase because it didn't fit properly so I couldn't take full-length photos of my kid.,0
5,I love this dress! It is my favorite dress for a night out on the town! I wore it for my birthday and received alot of compliments. I purchased the black and found it to be very flattering and comfy!,1
2,Beautiful color fabric feel good but cheaply made. Not even a label.,0
4,It's good.,1
5,It works,1
5,Just perfect for what I wanted,1
2,It looks cuter on the girl in the picture...  I don't have bangs so maybe that's why.  I look like a painter with it on,0
4,liked it,1
5,These are very pretty and just the right size. I am glad I ordered them.,1
3,"The inside of the bag peeled pretty bad. Other than that, it held up really well.",0
3,good quality. But way way way to small. Definitely not adult size.<br />My kid will be using these. Not I have to try to find ones that fit human adults,0
5,This bag is really cute.  I like the outside pockets.  The straps are long enough to carry it on your shoulder comfortably.  One of the best things is it is pretty water resistance and sturdy.,1
5,Seem to be good quality for an affordable price.,1
1,They are not soft cotton like yoga pants. They're more like thin basketball pants.,0
2,"Product is different from visual and description. The shirt I received is a very shiny silky material and big.<br />The order took 2 weeks to get to me, and was shipped from China. Not even sure how I would return it, nor worth the headache of finding out for $9.",0
5,Bought it as a gift. It's nice and large and super classy.,1
2,"I have 3 shirts just like this one (bright pink, bright green, and grey), that I really love, so I was really excited when I found it in blue. Much to my dismay, however, this shirt is nothing like my others. The material is completely different and the sizing is so much smaller. I figured that since it is the exact same shirt (design) that it would be the same, that could be my mistake. Unfortunately, I had to return.",0
5,A nice bracelet representing the solar system. Fun to wear.,1
3,"I am 5’4, 36 c, 170 lbs curvy blk woman. I ordered xl based on the reviews. I have a bit of bottom belly. The top was too big. My breasts were too small for the top so I have to figure how to take that in. The body part luckily has velcro so I can just add extra and overlap it. I feel I could have gone down a size or two. The panty part was made for children. If you have even the slightest rump this is going to be very revealing. just to get it to cover the crack the whole top of my v is out. I’ll have to make my own bottoms. The leggings do not go past my knee b/c of my thick thighs…not sure what I’m going to do about that…(will add photos later if it allows)",0
3,"based on reviews i sized up, the large fits like a fitted medium.<br />material isn't totally see-thru, but it is fairly thin. i was expecting and wanted something a bit thicker.<br />I'm 5'6 and dress came just to mid-thigh. stitching was nice and neat and it seemed finished all around, hood is a good size.",0
5,Best ever.. Definitely buy more,1
1,too small,0
3,"Hair is Black also head is made in China.<br />This is the size of a styrofoam wig head.<br />It is also a styrofoam head with wispy fly-away hair and i do mean wispy,i know that most all males are going bald but c'mon this needs more hair coverage in the back,not to much there looks like a barber did a job on him.<br />When i first saw the picture of this i thought to myself i gotta have that,so i like it but i'm not ape over it.<br />Came in a silver mylar bag with a postal shoe size box and in the box was head in a plastic bag and also was delivered by UPS from Charlotte,NC.<br />Whatever you do,do not pull,i repeat,do not pull on the hair cause it will all come out then you'll be left with a Yul Brynner type head.<br />Then you'll need more hair or a bigger hat to cover.Lol<br />When you get this find a place for it and leave it alone,i kind of recommend this item and i kind of don't.",0
4,great quality for the price.,1
3,Great material and they fit well except the front was very baggy. I waited too long and now I can't return them.,0
4,"Beautiful. A little on the short side, but I did measure before I bought them. Went for it anyway. A few more inches would have been awesome.",1
1,Very cheaply made washed one time and the threads started to shread causing a hole... Would never t buy Agian.. Tried  to contact  seller with no response back.,0
1,"ordered the large its way too small and it pulls on the axilla. The blouse is poorly made, horrible finished, its not sharp as it looks in the picture.",0
4,"I do not like the shiny material.  It is comfortable, fits well, good color",1
5,My wife uses them under her hand braces.  They are very comfortable and don't get too hot.  Amazing product that allows her to be more comfortable and not sweat when using her braces.  Easy to clean too...,1
3,"Love how they feel, but too slippery to walk around in. Hard to keep on my feet. Nine year old grandson loved them, so cut the jewels off, and he wears them in the evening/night.",0
5,I lost one of them which made me very sad. I'm still going to wear it as a single,1
2,Runs small don't care for the material or style not what i expected,0
5,"This dress was perfect for my trip, The quality was surprising good for the price. I ordered a size medium I am 5'6 tall and 150 pounds the length is perfect. It looks very flattering on. I wore it as a day dress and as an evening out dress, just changed my shoes. I received 2 compliments when I wore it.",1
5,Great dress. Comfortble and fit perfectly!,1
1,No way this can go on your ear like this! Deceptive photo.,0
5,Charge cards fit snugly and do not fall out when openen.,1
5,Very soft!  True to size.  It was purchased for a work Christmas party exchange and it was a huge hit!,1
5,Super cute. Great soft fabric. Easy to wear on the daily or dress it up with a jacket and necklaces for a classier look.,1
1,"Soooooo, though it's somewhat cute. The dress online does NOT come close to what you receive. First, the colors are not as bold. Second, the dress is straight, not long a flowy. Third...it comes to my ankles. I'm 5'6"" and weight 190. I was disappointed as the plan was to wear it to a wedding I'm singing at on July 3rd....will keep, maybe for work.....but  won't be wearing as planned.",0
2,It is cheap material and somehow it finds a way to ride up my torso and stay there. Ends up looking really funny.,0
1,not like it looks on line,0
5,I like it.  I am 175 pounds<br />5.5” and ordered a small.,1
5,"Great price, and better quality than expected.  I bought this for my daughter's Megara costume for the play Hercules, but I fully expect that she'll wear it often afterwards.  She loves it.  I actually bought it because folks said it runs small.  She'll be wearing it around her bicep, and it fits just a tad large placed there.  She's average for a nine y.o. if that gives you an idea about its size.",1
5,Real Pandora and perfect.  This bracelet is great.  I recommend buying from here.  Beautiful sterling silver and shipped in a nice box.,1
2,one of them snapped in half AS I WAS TAKING IT OUt OF THE PACKAGING.,0
1,Returning. Purchased XL and they look like child's XL.,0
5,"I got these for my grandson, he likes the longer leg he found them comfortable and he likes the fit...he's happy with the boxers.",1
1,Absolutely NOT a plus size.  I am a 2x and not even close to fitting me.,0
5,would love if you can brand these with a specific logo!  Highly recommend as a stand for either a phone or tablet.  phone may need to be out of a case.,1
4,"Item is exactly as described, fits as it should. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because when I washed it didn’t wash that “great”. It’s still nice and worth the money though.",1
1,Opened package and material had a hole and snag going down material.  Very disappointed with product.  Never buy this again.,0
5,This apron was made from quality fabric. The colors and print were festive! The perfect apron to wear while hosting a family Christmas event.,1
4,Fit my teenage daughter 13 perfect. (Size 5 she’s tall n skinny ) for the price it was worth every penny!  Got it for her to remind her of my love while away for work ! She’s loves it! Hopefully it won’t turn colors !,1
5,I got this and immediately loved it! I love wearing them with my friend.,1
5,Great shoes for school,1
1,Box arrived busted and sadly was way over priced. On top of that o cannot return through amazon. Very unhappy lately with some of amazons sellers.,0
5,Perfect size,1
2,"Size is fine, but you can see through the fabric.<br />Now only using as pajamas.",0
3,"It's a very attractive coat, out of the package, but the detailing is subpar, things like pocket sides and trim are barely tacked on. After one wearing  multiple bits of trim on my son's coat need to be repaired.  It is also cut very narrow, if you are a stocky build, this coat will not be sized correctly for your shape. This is very much a coat for long, slim bodies.",0
3,I bought these in October and and put them in rotation with my other pajamas. Last night I put on the dark plaid pair and found there was a 2 inch opening in the left leg inseam. This should not be happening even after 2 months. If my return date hadn’t passed they would have been returned. Not happy.,0
5,Was as discribed.,1
1,Very disappointed. Too long time to receive and the logo and letters are super small. Not as big as shown on description pic. Will no order anything else,0
5,Took the chance and got it. And turns out to be pretty great honestly plus it’s cute.,1
5,"Looks really great on. Love the colours. Just want to mention that when I first received beanie that it gad a really strong chemical smell about it so it had to be washed a couple of times to get rid of the smell. Not sure if that us always the case, probably not. But I would certainly recommend this beanie.",1
1,Looks very cheap!,0
5,It’s perfect for everything my granddaughter has to carry with lots of space.,1
2,Not quite as expected. The fit is a bit too high to the inner thighs. I will not recommend for big thighs because it will go up. I will stick to the longer boxer briefs.,0
2,Bought this for my girlfriend and she stated &#34; I usually wear a size 10 for my skirts and pants but the large did not fit once the zipper was going up. To tight.,0
5,I love the look and style of the dress .. it's true to size and goes below the knee..I have ordered 5 dress's from this company and plain on buying more ..,1
1,Runs about  3 sizes to small and they are NOT stretch at all. They make it very difficult to return Since I do not have a printer!,0
1,This dress is cut super small. I could not even get the dress over my head. I ordered a size up and is came like a Childs dress. I'm giving it one star because the size was not what was advertised.  Even if you take your measurements and order one size up you may be disappointed.,0
4,"Great sweater!  I wanted a cardigan so I could open it if I get too warm--this fits the bill.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was spoiled by the last sweater I bought from Woolovers, which has a zipper in addition to buttons.  Seems redundant but I like the flexibility it provides.  This new sweater does not have a zipper--so 4 stars instead of 5.",1
1,The material looks thicker than description,0
1,"They look great. The color was perfect. The fit was awful. The length and width are correct but across the top of your foot...just wear the ankle is introduced, it's really tight. I gave them away.",0
5,works great! this is what i expected.,1
5,True to size. Good quality. I bought it for my teenage daughter she couldn't be happier.,1
5,I love it..........,1
1,Very small,0
3,Nice top,0
5,Great,1
1,"This band is ridiculously long and physically sticks out, off the watch. I have thick wrists and its even long on me. The part that sticks out so far wont bend/relax in either because its rigid and has a velcro patch seen into it.",0
1,Shoe looses all support after worn for hour.<br /><br />Unfortunately no support and thin sole.<br /><br />Ok for in home use only. Dont even think about taking out the trash.,0
5,Since my son is getting a little older we decided to purchase a backpack to use as a diaper bag since we don't need to pack as much now. I love the size and how light weight it is. The side pockets are perfect for his sippy cups. Plenty of extra pockets to keep diapers and wipes separated as well as medicine and extra clothes!,1
5,"I am extremely allergic to all metals, these have made it possible for me to wear earrings. I love them! The only draw back is that they will make your earrings a little thicker (expected) and my holes are very tiny, it was a little bit of a struggle and uncomfortable to put them in, but once that was accomplished they worked great! I will be buying more!",1
4,Beautiful color and texture in this lightweight cardigan/jacket.  I ordered up to ensure the arms would fit.  I have very large upper arms causing most sleeves to be too tight.  I will have to take in the sides to get the body to fit.,1
2,"Cons: Wide, low cut v-neck PLUS tight waistband makes the sweater fit very unattractive.",0
1,"This is a medium, not a extra large. I can't wear.",0
2,"My daughter was very excited to get this bracelet and I'll admit that it was very pretty for the price.  Unfortunately, the first time she tried to put the bracelet on it broke.  I don't think this bracelet would have lasted for long even if it hadn't broken right off.  The ""metal"" looks to be very cheaply made.",0
2,Doesn’t always scream when introduced to light. Sometimes will scream randomly. The button works but would not but this again,0
5,Love the fit love the material. And the price,1
5,Looks really nice on,1
5,Cute!  Nice material.  I sized up for a looser fit.,1
3,A little too stretchy,0
2,"Delivery was great!! The product itself though (*from the seller) is very tight and very small. I hate returning things so I’ll give it to my mom to wear as a nightgown. It’s cool looking, but again….. it runs wayyyy too small!!",0
3,"Arrived on time, looks like the picture except not quite as nice quality.",0
2,Long time to ship from china for an adaquet item,0
5,Had to take on link out and now fits perfect. Good heavy duty band. Excellent product.,1
5,Me encanto,1
5,We've machine washed several times...hold up fine so far. The pads do show if you wear it without a shirt. Very comfortable!,1
5,Beautiful! Nice weight and lovely on!,1
2,"This mask is super cute, but it is so hot.  I wore it for 10 minutes before I had to switch to another mask.  It was 70 degrees outside and my face under the mask started to sweat. No way would I ever wear this mask in the summer.  The lining is a polyester fabric with contributes to the hot factor.  I would not recommend this to anyone who lives in a state that will be warmer than 70 degrees.  Cute, but that is where it ends for me.  It was a total waste of money!",0
4,Perfect for the price,1
1,Size description incorrect,0
1,Extremely cheap material. This is basically a long sleeve shirt. Lettering and design already seems to be fading and I just got it today. Very disappointed. I ordered a size 8-10 and what I recieved is more closely related to a 4-5. Completely a waste of time and money.,0
1,"They are extra long, but small circumference especially at biceps.",0
3,They were nice and I got a lot of compliments on them. However they are not made to last or made to be worn more than once. I hand washed them and hung them to dry and the one pair ripped while placing them one. I will not be buying these again.,0
5,"I really like this hat stretcher, I just did not like the time it took to get to me!!  Shipping was totally unacceptable",1
3,Shorter than expected.,0
5,Looks amazing,1
1,"Not as deep as pictured, very large and unflattering at bottom.",0
2,"I was very excited upon receiving these - I am 5'3"" and 115lbs and the small fit perfectly if you are looking for a relaxed, comfortable fit. Unfortunately, the first time I tried to wear this the buttons on the straps BOTH popped off.  I'm so disappointed because I really did like these! Be gentle and careful if you purchase!",0
2,I got the pink and it’s bright and not like the picture shows.  The straps don’t lay right.  The only good thing about this shirt is the fit is right.  I would not recommend it.,0
3,"The Lady of Grace enamel came plate off of the base two days after it was added to a necklace.  It's lovely, but I wish better adhesive could have been used.",0
5,Great for gifts,1
2,"Wanted to love these, but unfortunately they are somewhat see through. Would not recommend for squats as they are thin.",0
4,It hurts at my thighs and I don’t even have thick thighs,1
1,I'm a size 29 to 30. And yet I got a size 34.,0
2,Not bad for price,0
3,Good item!,0
5,"Best dress ever! Needed a dress last minute semi  formal dress, and I am plus size bit hate wearing ugly plus size tents. I am 5'9 230 lbs. I did put the straps up, but it's worth like 3 times the price. Amazing dress!",1
3,"I returned these because the ear loops were too big so the mask kept falling down. I also thought that they were 100% cotton and the ones I received looked and felt like a polyester blend. They may be good for a larger person, just did not work for me.",0
1,Zipper broke the first time trying it on. It is so small my small 6 year old can barely fit into it.,0
3,This top is good for hot weather but neck could be cut lower and straps are too flimsy. They curl up.,0
5,This is very pretty and is staying nice and shiny.  It's very light weight and the magnetic clasp makes it easy to put o. And take off.,1
4,These shoes fit larger than I expected,1
5,This watch is so me ! I love it & everyone always asks me where did i get it,1
1,"Waaaaaaay too small, I thought I'd be safe with medium and I'm nervous even the large wouldn't fit. I'm 5'3&#34; 136lbs way too small and tight in all the wrong places. The graphic is adorable and the material is nice but the sizing is way off. It did arrive sooner than expected so that was cool but I can't wear them. :(",0
2,I'm 5'5 and 140 lbs this sits at my waist line. The picture shows it being much longer. I got a large. The sleeves fit but are too short. Only by this if you are tiny.,0
5,So cute. Exactly what I expected. No complaints,1
5,Great short.  Comfortable and not see through.,1
1,"Product was described as not see through, when these are in fact see through. Had to return them.",0
1,The shorts are extremely thin and loose. They also came with multiple obvious loose threads. Super low quality.. I would recommend avoiding this product!,0
4,I like it! Light weight. Only two issues I have with it is that it’s a bit see through and the front horizontal stitching isn’t long enough. But I got a big enough size we’re it should be ok,1
3,The dress is beautiful but its too big so i have to send It back.,0
2,"does not look like the picture which shows a distressed type of cotton.  This was just a plain tan v neck tshirt, and sleeves are shorter than they appear in pics also",0
2,"This blouse is okay I guess. If you are typically a size small and have any bust at all, size up. It will be tight across the chest and the whole thing will be too short on you. The sleeves are too short too and they look really awkward. I don't recommend this shirt.",0
1,The anklets are cute but weak.  The first time i wore it it broke and fell off my ankle.,0
3,To small,0
5,"I love this dress! Let me start with my size. I'm typically a size 10-12 jean, L/XL top and am 5'3. I bought the large and it fit perfect! The dress is absolutely so soft and comfortable and is perfect for any occasion. It hits the floor on me but will be perfect will a slight heel/wedge. Looks just like the picture.",1
2,I am 5 ft 1 in and this dress way way too long. It is going back.,0
3,Won't stay on without making a few knots.,0
3,"the jacket is great and super soft and warm, however, the arms are an inch/ two inches too short for me. super disappointed.",0
3,I ordered a small and the skirt fit a lil loose but the top showed to much side boobs. The material is soft and the blue is a pretty color,0
2,The image does not match the product.,0
3,Great fabric but rips at the seams soo easily.,0
5,wife loves them.,1
3,Too small,0
4,Good for the price,1
5,"I don’t usually write reviews for Amazon anymore because they pick & choose what they want written, but I really like these leggings. They fit perfectly and feel smooth & silky. I’m 5’4 and 150lbs, so I purchased a medium. The best part is the price because I can’t tell the difference between these and my very expensive leggings.",1
4,This is a nice lightweight hoodie that pairs nicely with leggings or yoga pants. Comfortable if you have a bootie and are looking for something long go a size up,1
5,"This product was exactly as i expected it to be.  the color was dead on, the fit was perfect and they were comforatble. the price was right and they really made the outfit complete!",1
2,"They were good sunglasses, work as expected, and have a great look. My only complaint is that the plastic is cracking under the lenses. But, I guess they are $10 glasses, so what was I expecting?<br /><br />Edit: They have completely cracked at the lens, and the lens fell out. Contacted seller through e-mail and got no response. Beware when buying these.",0
5,great product,1
5,"Good quality, forgiving fabric, comfortable and cute! Colors are bright and as is...I've purchased 4 and will be purchasing more -- my favorite is the apple green!",1
3,Junk,0
5,"I was so excited to see this shirt when I was looking for a Red Wings shirt to wear on Sports Team Wednesdays at work.  As a long time Red Wings fan, I was over the moon when it was announced this spring that Steve Yzerman was coming back to Detroit as GM. This was the news many of us had hoped to read ever since he departed for Tampa, and it’s great to see The Captain wearing Red Wings colors again!<br /><br />This shirt says exactly what many of us are feeling right now and says it on nice quality, soft fabric. The fabric is not heavy and thick, but it’s not cheap and thin either. I would also say this shirt is true to size and did not shrink a lot at all. The colors did not run and although I have only washed it twice so far, it’s held up well in the wash.<br /><br />So excited for StevieY’s return to Detroit, and proud to wear a shirt that says so!",1
5,"The necklace is beautiful, it does however look like a giraffe until you take a closer look at it. I gave it to two of my nieces who are in gymnastics and both thought it was a giraffe, until I asked them to look closer. Once they realized what they were looking at, they loved it even more.",1
5,"This is the second set I buy. Love this sets, it’s so easy to organize the clothes in the luggage. Such easy access to them too. Keeps the clothes in place. I used the small ones for socks and intimates and the big ones for shirts/dresses/shorts.",1
1,Pequeños,0
3,Not alot of padding on the sole. The arch doesn't sit well against my foot. It feels like something is poking me.,0
5,Love this slim band,1
2,"I’ve been buying more adidas products recently and have been overall happy. This hat isn’t it though, odd fit and not stylish.",0
2,This necklace broke the fourth time it was worn.,0
1,"I ordered my size (based on their chart) and it wasn't even CLOSE to being big enough!  Like 6 full inches away from closing!  Additionally, this thing is absolutely NOT as long as the picture depicts. Boo all the way around...returning.",0
5,"OMGSH! This Ring Is Gorgeous I Got It In The Mail And Let Me Tell You It's Breath Taking I'm So Happy I Ordered This One  It's Absolutely Perfect , All I Can Say Is Y'all Order You Can't Go Wrong With This Girls Absolutely Stunning.",1
3,Not really to my liking looks more like a witch costume,0
5,Fits great.,1
2,Bad design and overpriced.,0
1,"There skirt was faulty, pleat were not accurate and bad stiching",0
3,Sizing not accurate,0
2,Thin material. Only wore them about 6 times. Toe came through.,0
2,"I love the look of the sandal but it's not meant to be.  I got my normal size 10 and they were too long.  So I returned and got a 9.5, those seem too narrow and still a little too long.  I also have to pull the velcro pretty far over to get a good fit and then it looks weird.  I don't know if the sizing is weird on these or if I need a wide width, maybe I just weird feet.  In any case, I give up.  It's really disappointing since these are so cute.  It's really hard to find cute, supportive sandals for PF. Maybe if I could find them in store and try different sizes/widths I could find the right fit.  But I feel bad buying and returning size after size.",0
2,"This &#34;leather&#34; card wallet feels thin & cheap. I don't expect this to last more than 6 months. I don't think this wallet should be more than $5. Of course, for the price, this isn't going to be a quality wallet, like a Fossil.",0
5,Love this. Cozzy and comfortable. A lot of compliments to my babyboy,1
3,"Way smaller than it should have been 2x was ordered for my boyfriend, ended up going to my eleven year old boy.",0
1,I purchase these gloves to replace ones (I had lost one of the gloves in a parking lot.)  I find leather keeps me warm in Chicago.  Initially I was disappointed as the fingers were WAY too long.  But imagine my dismay as a seam is already separating after less than 3 weeks!  I highly recommend you DO NOT purchase this item!<br />(The picture of the ripped seam will not load!),0
3,"I love Maidenform bras. However, this is the first sports bra I bought from the brand, and the cup was too big compared to the normal bras by the brand.",0
5,Love this brand. Fit great and last forever.,1
1,"[[VIDEOID:55d2d15ce41bb84eaa516e86eeef413b]] Material and and design is WAY DIFFERENT then what they have shown in the picture. It is sheer and see-through, basically feels/ looks like a nightgown. So disappointed, if I wanted a bed sheet to wear, I wouldn’t have spent this much money on one. Definitely returning!!! It’s not worth the money wouldn’t recommend.",0
5,The socks fit as they should and do help keep the feet warm.,1
3,"It's pretty, but very lightweight, and the quality isn't great.  Good gift for a young teen perhaps.",0
1,Completely fell apart. Don’t buy,0
5,"Fast shipping, great syle, fit great and looks cool.",1
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!,1
5,Great and stylish!,1
3,The arrived and fit a bit small.,0
3,What is it with the color white that has a pink hue to it That's what this top has,0
3,"Pants fit fine, but they fall down a lot, so would not be suitable for exercise or work. I will continue to use them for around the house tho. Need more support for the top. I wear size 12 and got the large. Maybe medium would have been more sufficient?",0
3,nice and hot Gloves,0
2,After 3 months of used they were totally garbage. It is a shame because they were comfortable and look nice but as days past they just deteriorated more and more until finally we were unable to fix them.,0
5,Nice bracelet,1
2,"Daughter was living it. Lights up and comfortable fit. After a month of use, one foot stopped charging. Never again.",0
1,This shirt runs small and is a very thin material.  Not good quality.,0
3,Shoes were fine until I had to wash them. One of the shoes had the inside pieces come out in the wash and fell apart. So buy the shoes but don’t let your kid get them dirty because you can’t wash them.,0
1,"Save your money! Material is very thin..I’m 5’3, 115 pounds. I ordered a small and it was huge. I contacted Amazon and the seller several times with either no help or no response.",0
5,"Love them.  Perfect size, oversized.",1
1,The screw fall out on my second used,0
5,"I am 5'8&#34;, 180 lbs with a pear shaped figure.  This dress is a lighter version of Kentucky blue. It fits snug on top (I wear a 36C) and to my waist then flares around my hips and thighs. From the pics it looked like it might be too short for me (I like knee length) but it is longer than I expected.  There was a lose thread under the arm but no holes or deformity. The collar looks like a t-shirt. There a a seam down the back of the skirt. I plan to order more for vacation.",1
3,"Cute dress, just smaller than I expected. Quality isn’t the best but definitely decent for the price point",0
2,Sent it back!,0
3,Pants fit great. The top ran small. Still worked for what I needed it for.,0
4,Lightweight comfortable and cute perfect summer dress,1
1,Way toooo smalll not much give in fabric.,0
5,"Those who complained that it is too thin must have not read what material it is made out of... Learn to read, people! Def runs a little small; I am generally a medium, so the large fits perfectly. Bought this for a job interview and I am very pleased with it! :)",1
5,Highly recommend these capris. Supportive but so soft. I would live in these if I could. I am a plus size and these fit very well- true to size. I will be buying more.,1
5,I like the way the shirt fits ans feels as I wear them daily in the cooler months of the year.,1
2,Looks pretty but the bar was not curved. I'll have to try to bend it but I didn't have high expectations for $3,0
5,soo beautiful. thanks! delivered fast ',1
5,"Great shirt, true to size.",1
5,Straight out the package this necklace made think twice about ordering it.. but when I put it on with my dress.. this necklace made a big difference!!!,1
3,I found the rhinestones make it hard to slide the belt through the belt hoops but with a little tugging it goes through. Concerned the rhinestones wont last long if you have to do that.,0
5,"Absolutely fantastic product. I spend `12-14 hrs a day on my feet. Toward the halfway mark I always had to re-tie or adjust my shoelaces r/t foot swelling.  These make my shoes a non-concern. Comfortable all day, and best of all I do not have the instant urge to kick off my shoes when I walk in the door after work.  Can't believe I never tried them before. Ordering six more sets, colors for all my work shoes.",1
3,Runs to small,0
5,"The material of this shirt is soft and comfortable, and it's also figure flattering.",1
1,"Excellent quality leather however very short band. Unless you’re a female or have a very small wrest, this is a super small size band.",0
1,This product was a major disappointment. The fabric quality was horrific. I would put it as discount halloween costume level. I would not recommend. Also the item was drop shipped from china and took many many weeks to arrive. They are also shorter than would be ideal.,0
5,"Nice and shiny, no kinks when it came. Good colors.<br /><br />Does unhook a little easily, but I wouldn't say it just randomly comes off. If you twist around a little it might but I've been wearing them for a while and it's fine.<br /><br />It's a tad tight. I only have a 28in waist and it's a tad tight, but not uncomfortably so.",1
5,My 4yo LOVES these. Wears them daily since she received them in her stocking for Christmas. I’ve worn a pair also! Stays on all day!,1
2,Buy a size bigger.,0
2,"Idea was good but cheaply made for the price, the wood used for the pendant is ridiculously light, wood used for toothpicks has more density than this... My son could've made this for me for a fraction of the price! Won't wear it for fear that the beads might pop which is another thing so I guess it'll just be an ornament for my desk.",0
3,Fit is cute,0
2,Some came with the diamonds off or slanted,0
2,"the magnetic snap is weak, it does not stay closed and keep contents from spilling out otherwise the material is very nice. If you are willing to replace the magnetic snap to a regular snap then it will be a great little carry bag.",0
5,"Great replacement.  I actually installed this on my GW6900 watch as a great lower profile option over the stock, more &#34;bulky&#34; design.",1
5,Nice light weight Tee. Very comfortable. Keeps shape and size after washing.,1
5,I keep ordering these - love em,1
3,Pretty dress I got olive and it was not olive but more like a ashy green. It was riding up the shoulders. The arm holes are small. Got it to wear to a wedding but didn’t wear it.,0
3,It's a decent watch. After about a year one of my buttons became almost unusable so now I can't change the time. For the money its fine.,0
3,"These look of decent quality and read reviews saying to go up a size and I did. They fit length wise but they are SUPER NARROW. I do not have wide feet, just medium width. I was gonna reorder a size larger but realized that they would be too long then and still be too narrow. I am returning them, but it did occur to me that since they are a natural fabric, if someone wanted to test it, they could be stretched like you you re-stretch shrunken natural fabrics like wool and cotton. I didn't want to take the chance so returning. They are super cute.",0
5,Love everything about this dress I received plenty of complaints.,1
4,"This is a great watch and I love the look of it. My only reason for the 4-star rating is due to the band- it has these stabilizers at the base of the watch that are meant to keep the rather large watch piece from rolling on your wrist. The material of the band and stabilizers is uncomfortable against the skin and actually pulls the hair on my arms (I ended up removing the pins and shaving down and removing the stabilizers).<br /><br />This was my experience of course, so may not be the same for the next buyer. But, I would like it if Casio offered other band options for this or other makes-I have not found any so far.",1
5,I love . It,1
5,"This shirt is so comfortable if you live in colder weather or if you like to lounge around in warm tops.  Loved the color and fairly true to size, but they probably run a little big.  So comfortable I would buy another one solely for that soft material!",1
1,The pants came ripped.,0
5,"This is a lovely grey/purple with iridesence, it is strikiing and people have asked me about it, business and professional but still with a touch of whimsy!",1
5,Love the band.  Goes well with my Apple watch,1
5,"so much better then I thought.  It fits great, looks great, and fantastic price...Looks like real gold, and is really light weight.. very very happy with this",1
3,"I wanted to love, but the top part ran large on me. Did not provide any support, had to return.",0
2,"I ordered an XXL and was shocked at how small it was.  In reality it was, at best, your typical L size.<br /><br />Material is thin but not surprising considering the cheap price.",0
2,I returned it it is like micro mini,0
3,There were four sets of duplicates which means there were four short of a full amount that I purchased I didn't order duplicates nor did I want duplicates,0
1,This umbrella is very difficult to close.,0
1,I felt like these rings pinched my belly button.,0
1,"Too late to return and replace. I’d give it negative 100 stars if I could. I guess you get what you pay for. I was going to give this to the hostess of my Christmas dinner but if I can’t get flowers glued back on it isn’t happening. Not to mention the antlers are…RUBBER???  Heck, it’s so junkie I might not give it at all. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. EVER!!!",0
5,Loved this dress!,1
2,Cheap product. Can not use in a heat press due to melting issues. Will not buy again.,0
5,My favorite goes with everything. Had for a long time still in great condition.,1
2,It broke before I was able to wear it. It was the cheese burger! But everyone loved it!,0
4,Love them... Except the stain on the posts didn't match the backs. I got 3 blacks and only 2 cherry wood. Otherwise awesome.,1
1,Cheap made I rhink it actualy makes my boobs way smaller and hurts bc there is no padding just a really flat tight layer of fabric for the cup I didn't think it would be so bad when I orders but i was so wrong ill keep to the same one from fall sweets its made way better an worth the money,0
5,"I got a nice leather strap for mine, and it is really nice.  Love the blue hue on the sapphire.  The case is nicely polished.  Movement has only lost a few seconds since I've owned it.  Stopwatch works perfectly.  This is good stuff.",1
2,"This dress is see through, it's cheap, thin material. I pictured something cute and when the dress arrived it is not as pictured. They only the same is the print.",0
1,"The fabric is soooo thin, I thought it might be worth the inexpensive price for just under skirts, but no...it's just too cheap.",0
1,Small and thin material. I sent it back and was reimbursed quickly,0
4,Super cute! I paired with a white crop top and sneakers!,1
5,"You look like you belong in a 70's or 80's movie with these in a nice car with the top down.  Stylish and compliments are more than welcome with these glasses.  Quality is good and they do not bend easily, sturdy.",1
5,"I bought this for my 17 year old daughter and so far have heard no complaints. good looking hat,fits good and quality of nike.",1
3,These boots are beautiful but the fit around the ankle is a bit uncomfortable,0
5,beautiful,1
5,"Worked exactly as described, and plenty of extra real estate to fit virtually any size shoe.  These are thin (which is what I wanted) as described, moreso than typical sole rubber replacement.",1
4,"Share a b-day with Van Gogh, so collecting jewelry of his works to wear.",1
5,Good cuality,1
3,"They were just ok. They seemed to be made well, But I ended up returning them. I normally fit just fine in a 2xl and thought they were way too tight.",0
3,Doesnt stay put,0
5,love them fit right,1
5,"The color is different but neutral. The leather on the top is a smaller size than my previous FitFlops that I love, though I do not think it changes the fit or the look. I can tell because of my FitFlop tan.  I prefer simple Fit Flops like these but they are harder to get these days with all the bows, flowers, etc.",1
5,This was so easy,1
5,This is a great polishing cloth.  It works better than I imagined.  The seller shipped it very quickly and followed up via email to ensure I was completely satisfied.  I will definitely order the same cloth from the same seller again.,1
2,"Really cute set. The straps are adjustable, but unfortunately the plastic to hold the strap together was broken on arrival.",0
5,Love it!  Wish there was more colors!,1
4,nice but order 1 size larger for a good fit,1
4,"acceptable quality and nice, fits great",1
5,My daughter is going to love these for Easter!,1
4,So far so good,1
3,They are much smaller than I expected.,0
5,Hermoso y buenos,1
1,"looks very cheap, returned",0
1,In the very first minute after unpacking from delivery they broke.The plastic piece connecting the two lenses as shown in the picture is separated. Once this is broken the lense frame that tucks into a sleeve no longer stays in place. So if you are riding a motorcycle the wind will pull the lense out. This could easily cause an accident and would be a danger to the rider(s). Don’t buy these!,0
5,"Comfortable, durable, and super cute. Great price too.",1
2,Uncomfortable,0
5,Super cute! I ordered an 8.5 even tho I wear an 8 because that's all that was available. Good thing because they just fit. Consider ordering a half size larger.,1
1,"The straps were not well attached, ripped within minutes of wearing it.  Not worth $14.",0
5,"I used an outfit for a family look alike day, on Boxing Day. Everyone who saw us enjoyed seeing the family dress the same.",1
1,"I saw the reviews saying this robe ran small so I ordered the XXXL thinking that would surely fit. Nope. Seems like a nice robe (color, fabric, etc.) but unless you are a beanpole, don't bother.",0
5,A must for any uniform!,1
4,"This is a nice mask. It doesn't have adjustable ear loops, but still fits nicely.",1
2,It looks good but the adjustment in the back flops around and slips loose. This makes the fit for the birds. I would not buy another.,0
3,It was cheap and it's cute - quality is fine for the money.,0
1,Not made very well. Came apart in 2 wks,0
1,Extremely short. Even fully opened would barely fit over my head.  Then the uke is at nose level.,0
1,Not good either,0
1,"The first day it was perfect and lasted all day, then it was put on the charger all night and the next day it lasted 30 minutes before it died. Won’t hold charge",0
1,"I don’t know if this is supposed to be a gag gift? It is thick, skin tight, and barely stretches and has NO breathing holes for mouth or nose!! I almost had a panic attack trying to get it off my face realizing I couldn’t breathe AT all in it!! Bad bad bad!! This was for my 10 yr old!!",0
4,My son is slender with an athletic build. He likes his clothes fitted and this shirt was perfect.,1
5,"This product is great for cosplay or in the bedroom. Skirt was separate from the corset which makes for gray versatility in styling. Product features both a side zipper and lace back, so you don’t have to completely re-/ un- lace every time you wear it. I’m very excited to use this for my next local convention!",1
2,"This Shapeware runs very small, I returned it and replaced it with a different plan a child very happy",0
1,Cheap trainer.. not great material to promote sweat either.,0
2,Never worn because they were too small and I threw the box away.  I ordered the small medium since all my clothing is small.  If you are small and have curves... order up or maybe this product isn’t for us.,0
5,like the socks.,1
5,Excelente,1
5,"I usually buy Allegra so I give it a five.  I think that the shirt made me look pregnant.  The size I ordered was what I usually order and it was a little bit tight from the underarms to my chest, I am a size 40D.  I gave it to my niece but she had the same issue. She is a DD.  I just think the shirt was not made for us and there is really nothing wrong with it so I give it 5 stars.  She shirt is actually beautiful but not for me.",1
5,So pretty. I have very sensitive ears and have to be careful what I wear. Bought these for my 2nd hole. Love the long post. One ear did get a little sore but like I said I have very sensitive ear,1
5,"I'm 5'10 and normally a 18-20 but this fit only a lil snug. It's actually long enough for me and the ruffles are very forgiving for this mummy tummy! Glad I took a chance with this brand,  seems well made especially at the price point!!",1
5,These keys are very nice. Lots of different types.,1
4,Love it.  I work in the hospital and this works well with putting on and taking off gloves. Only downfall is that I have such a small wrist I'm on the last hole. Still love it though.,1
2,"Jacket is fine, more like a heavy sweater, but sizing (XXL) was well below reg XXL stuff",0
3,Cute product but kind of long for what I wanted,0
5,I like it 😊,1
5,"I own two of the Walz wool caps.  These are great, well-built caps.  The sizes do run a bit small.  I'm a size 8 and ended up going with 2XL.",1
2,Very soft and nice fit.  First time I wore it I put my<br />Hand in my pocket and it ripped apart,0
3,"Great concept and the materials are great, however the execution and size is too small for an adult male's face.  I gifted it to my 12y/o daughter instead.",0
4,"I absolutely love these plugs, and they have nice quality. I rated these at 4 stars because they are very cool, although they don't get 5 because the o-rings could've been a bit stronger.",1
2,Ordered an 2X it's more like a 2X in kids.  Gave them to my daughter who wears 10 in juniors.  Cutting pattern no where close to the picture.,0
1,Weird fit! Nothing like the picture! Too small up top in the chest and way too big in the skirt. Cheaply made and not a good design or fabric (way too thick). I would send back but I tried to take in the skirt thinking I could fix it and it only made it worse.,0
5,My daughter loves to dress up and was excited to get this!,1
4,"The quality is good and it's quite warm. The lining is thick and soft. Only issue is that it runs very small - I ordered a size larger so it would fit over clothes and it's obviously much smaller than the standard for that size. That means it won't fit my child for very long. Had I known, I would have bought two sizes up.",1
1,"Why do the sell this as a 34B when it is obviously more like a 28 or 30 B? I didn't listen to the other reviews because I am rail thin on the top part of my body but I was so uncomfortable wearing this at work with it cutting off my circulation that I had to go home early. I will always sacrifice comfort for stlye, so this is saying a lot for me.",0
5,The adopting mother loved this bracelet.  It is well made and very sweet.,1
1,I am very large breasted and this style did not fit well at all. The waist was barely under my breast line and looked more like a maternity dress than a nice gown.,0
5,Beautiful and roomy.  I would have liked one more zippered pocket inside the bag but that is minor.  I love it.,1
1,The bracelet was nice but cheap. It broke while putting it on.,0
3,Update: they broke at the velcro strap after a few weeks of wearing. Sad outcome. We bought these for my 4Yo Halloween costume and she loved them! No blisters after 3 nights!,0
5,Very vibrant color and detail.  Adds a great touch to my beach themed bath.  Thanks!,1
2,"[[VIDEOID:e52009d849267402671decb33f9dd085]] I didn’t expect much, but even setting the bar low...I am still a tiny bit disappointed. I ordered a 9 (US) and it is more like an 11.<br />I like to come back to look at pics or reviews AFTER I receive something and it DOES look like the seller’s photos exactly. And the description details they provide is accurate. But.....as for the reviewers saying it’s more beautiful than they expected? Nah lol I call bs. It IS pretty in person from afar. My boyfriend complimented it from across the dimly lit room. But that was straight out of the box.The band feels like plastic and the gem is fine except you can sort of see the glue around the rim holding it in. I predict my future includes gold chipping and brass underneath turning my finger green as reviewers before me have claimed.<br />It was cheap (that’s why we bought it, right?) so take it for what it’s worth. I just was hoping it would be one of those situations where you’re pleasantly surprised. but hey, better luck next time lol<br /><br />Video note: the other ring is a rainbow moonstone ring (the mellow Apollo is the name I think) I got from moonmagic.com that is a US size 10. Just included to compare to something for perspective. Excuse the video. Kind of hard to use one hand and the iPhone focus up close is not something I have mastered LOL",0
3,I assume that this is called dainty for a reason. The necklace does fit the title. It is a cute layered necklace but it is very fragile. It feels as if I pull it the wrong way that it will break. I will say that it is cute for what it is.,0
1,"Horrible, mala calidad, más transparencia que la bolsa de envío 😞😒 y no hacen reembolso y el envío me costo más caro que el trapito 😒",0
1,I have ordered this set twice to get one that looks like the picture and I have failed both times...very frustrated!,0
1,"I loved the color, but hook broke while trying it on.",0
5,This dress is one of my favorites,1
1,"The skirt is nice, and the wings are ok, but the bodice is terrible.  It is not attached and comes in several pieces, leaving the buyer to spend 45 minutes to lace up the front and back.  The silver is scratchy and cheep looking as well as the fake roses.  The tulle is nice, very fairy princess-like, and I tried another corset top to match a better looking outfit, but to no avail.  It was well packaged and arrived on time, but if the top were a little better quality, it would have been good for a Halloween costume.",0
5,"Beautiful bracelet, bigger than I expected",1
5,"You can feel the clicking of the security spring inside and it does not slide back off while wearing. I feel secure while wearing them on the back of my expensive studs, unlike the cheap ones from Walmart. Just wish the clear part was wider as they do droop some.",1
5,"Love the quality and design.  The material is not very stretchy so I had to send it back for a bigger size.  Once I got the right size I loved it and received a lot of complements.  I am 6 foot tall and it goes all the way to the floor, so heads up if you're shorter.",1
5,"The dress is beautiful and-super confortable the size  S fit good for me I am 5,5 and 120 love my dress thanks",1
5,Perfect on the go size.  The colors are fantastic.,1
5,Great price!,1
5,Another win! Cute & flattering I love this sweater too!,1
1,"Took the shoes out of the bag and both noses fell off. I glued them back on with super glue and they have stayed ever since. However, upon wearing the shoes a couple of times, I have lost 3 out of 4 ears. I do not recommend this product.",0
2,was very disappointing,0
1,"This did nothing for my shoes, I used it on leather and got zero results. Waste of money",0
1,"This item was described as a brooch, with one of the beans hanging on the outside. I bought a couple since one of my kids loves brooches and pea pods so I thought it’d be a win. Alas, not the case.<br />POS- don’t waste your money or time..",0
1,This looks so cheap in person. I really needed the bracelet to work for an outfit but I just can't justify keeping it. The gold plating is the type that looks like it would chip right off if bumped.,0
1,"Bizarre sizing.  I am a size 6.  I ordered a small.  I did this because there was a note that sizes had been adjusted in 2016.  Yet, the sleeves were at least 3 inches too long.  I've never had fit issues with arm length.  The rest of the coat was bulky and unbecoming.  And back it goes!",0
1,Cheap and poorly made,0
2,"Cheap fabric, bad fit, poor construction. Even with my low expectations, it was not worth the price. Its better to by cheap things at Walmart or Target - at least you know what you are paying for.",0
5,Perfect. Purchased for granddaughter!,1
2,"The umbrella is  very heavy and hard ,for my hands to open. The concept  is unique it is just not made for someone with arthritis in hands...",0
5,So soft! Looks just like the pictures,1
5,Easy for children,1
3,From the reviews they all say the shirt runs small.  The company must bulk cut their shirts because I ordered a size up and it's big on me like the next size up would be.  Also the shirt is made out of bathing suit like material and very thin.  The shirt is very similar to the picture shown but not nearly as nice as pictured .,0
3,Not the quality I expected. Fabric is a bit too shiny for my taste. The sheen makes the skirt appear quite cheap in appearance. The waist was also a bit bulky. The design needs a little more atreamlining for a smoother transition from top to skirt.,0
5,Exactly as advertised! Great quality! Perfect size!,1
5,My Godson loved them! He’s playing basketball & really into it 😁🙏🏼🏀,1
5,"Grand son like it,Thank u.",1
4,It’s really cute! I’m usually a medium in juniors so I ordered the small it fits good,1
1,Bought 1/2 size larger and toes still crushed. Anything made in China sucks in quality and sizing is ALWAYS off!,0
5,"well the thing that snapped on top said to use a hair dryer and brush to it, I send the hat back",1
1,"I would give it a 0 if I could! Horrible quality. It is made of some sort of slip-like material, almost swimsuit like. Its actually shiny. I ordersd short sleeved and got long sleeved. The neckline chokes me and it is see through. You could see my bra through the material on the top and the waste is bunched. The pockets stick out. It is horrendous",0
1,These earrings fell apart out of the package. The tassels fell apart. I couldn’t even wear them.,0
5,super cute.  Stretchy material.,1
5,These shoes are perfect. I tried other shoes and had much difficulty fitting a normal shoe over my daughters AFO’s. The Billy shoe fits and zips up great. We do have to take the padding out and her AFO fits great.<br />Thank you,1
1,Broke the 1st time I put it on and the beads went everywhere 😡😡,0
4,We actually ordered two of this dress.  The first one my daughter didn't order according to her measurements and it was too big.  The second one I helped her order by the posted measurements and it fit perfectly.  The lace is soft and not stiff.  The quality is good.  It looks just like the posted dress.  I know there has been some concern about quality when buying dresses online.  You do not need to be concerned with this dress.  The train on the back of the dress is the perfect length.  Short in the front for dancing.  Long in the back for elegance.  My daughter bought it to wear for a winter formal.,1
3,Beautiful material loved it but Size L was too small on the top area for my breasts size c/d.,0
2,I exchanged for s size smaller but now too small and not very comfy! Unfortunately I took tags off so cannot return....wasted $$,0
5,"Fit Very well.  Nice pockets and resilient elastic waist... hopefully have years of use, seem durable.",1
5,I got this as a gift for my son.He has been wearing it constantly.,1
1,It looks so cheap with that price.  I bought the one from Jamboree it is only 1/2 price but looks more expensive .  I will return.,0
4,"Does exactly what I need, holds my pants up.",1
5,A bit expensive but my grandson likes them and we do too! Very nice.,1
5,These are really nice shorts! Fit well and great quality. Happy with them.,1
2,Much shorter than I expected. I am 5’6 and ordered a medium. It was extremely wide and well above my knee to the point I was afraid to bend over at all. I returned it.,0
1,Very cheap and RIP me off hidden feels bad product deceiving,0
3,"Like: color, feel, and look. Dislike pocket placement, sizing seems off/small in places, and don’t wash well.",0
1,Have requested a return from this seller with no response after several days.  Bras are large and fit like a small. Need return.,0
3,"it only good for 2 weeks , also I am tits not easy to take breathe when I wear that",0
3,It fits ok.,0
5,Good fit and no leakage.,1
4,"This is better than, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Only thing I found was the distortion at the edges. Other than that I am satisfied.",1
2,Amazon told me to order a size smaller than I normally would which would be an XS. I saw the reviews also said it ran a little large so that’s what I ordered. It sat pretty awkward on me. It was tight in the hips and legs as well as the chest but loose in the waist and arms.,0
3,More of a shirt than dress. Too short to classify as dress.,0
5,"What a deal!  10 bracelets (without buckles) in beautiful colors.  My fitbit came with a buckle bracelet which i did not like at all.  I love the snap option and easily change the band to match my outfit for the day.  I didn't like any of the fitbit band colors and initially thought I was purchasing one band (which was still less than the fitbit band).  When I realized I was getting 10 bands, I was elated.",1
5,Lovely.,1
1,Cheap cheap cheap,0
2,Fell apart and way too heavy to wear for any amount of time.,0
5,"I am able to talk and breathe, while wearing mask. My job requires mask wearing, so I am able to adhere to safety measures and be comfortable.",1
5,Very pretty.,1
3,Soft material and fits true to a US toddler size.,0
5,These pants were so comfortable and good quality. They were a bit too long but can easily be hemmed to preference.,1
4,I believe that I'm the one that got the sizing wrong lol but I'm also pregnant! All around love the dress! It's soft and light weight. I was comfortable all night and couldn't have asked for more!!,1
2,The elastic is too thin to hold shape on the body,0
3,"It arrived broken on the back. Not worth hassling with, but it is disappointing because it was so nice. The one is useless.",0
5,Love this shoe!,1
5,This is so Damn cute,1
5,"Got this to wear around the house during the winter to stay warm (I'm always colder than the rest of my family).  It's perfect for that purpose.  It fit as expected and keeps me plenty warm.  I like that it has both a zipper and snaps.  I zip it up when I'm really cold, but just close one or two snaps when I only need a little extra warmth.  Because this is somewhat bulky, I can't imagine wearing it underneath an actual coat (as I have done with thinner vests in the past), but over a long sleeve shirt, it's perfect.  I wish the collar was a little smaller.  Also the drawstring around the collar seems unnecessary to me; I removed it.",1
5,"absolutely beautiful, can't wait to wear it for New Year's Eve party",1
2,The surface area that touched my skin is not at all polished as smoothly as it should with such a material and had visible nics around the edges upon arrival. It caused my ears to become raw and sore. They were pretty but significantly darker than the picture. Almost black. At no fault of the product I did end up dropping one in the bathtub and it knocked a huge chunk off one of them but I didn't really plan to continue using them anyway due to the mediocre quality.,0
5,Perfect. Light weight but toasty warm.  It keeps me warm camping in California or Arizona winters. Haven’t yet tried it in more brutal climates.,1
1,"It’s way thinner than I thought, and it keeps rolling up at the bottom, it was not what I expected it",0
3,"It's nice combination color of dress! Quality doesn't look expensive !<br />I retuned due the size not actuate as described. Don't follow Amazon size chart. I'm 116lbs, bust 35, waist 27, hips 37. Ordered size small ,it's too tight",0
1,I ordered a 2xl and it's the size of a medium or small. I wish the listing would tell you that it's Asian sizing.,0
5,"These rings are amazing! My husband and I both love them and they have replaced our wedding bands. I received this product in men's size 11 at a discount for my honest and unbiased review; however, these are my favorite of all the silicone bands that I have tried and I will be purchasing a set for myself since I bought these for my husband and his are so nice!!! The bands are thick (but not in an excessive way), comfortable, and feel like a high quality material. I would highly recommend these over other brands.",1
5,Well I had been looking for a bag that would keep my stuff organized.<br />This bag has done just that. I love all the compartment that it has and it’s easy to keep your clothes separated. I’ve been using it for 3 weeks and I really like it.,1
5,silky type scrub top,1
4,Too small,1
1,arrived with a broken handle,0
5,Fits perfectly,1
1,Runs 2 sizes to small...if it fit the jacket would have been perfect.,0
4,"It was very nice, but it was too small . Took too long to get it .",1
1,Did not like the overall fit and it's to long,0
4,Very comfortable. Very pleased with the product.,1
5,Love them...,1
5,Beautiful cheap glasses! Can't get much better... I love these and their price!!!,1
3,"Cute but way too long for someone who is 5&#34;4, well past the knee",0
5,"This is possibly my 3rd F91W-1 Casio watch. I am hard on exterior wear watches, but not this one, it stands up. I wear it swimming, use it as a stopwatch at outdoor events. It keeps time to the second for months without resetting. It is my alarm clock when traveling and always having the day of the week and date displayed is super convenient. I hope Casio never stops selling them.",1
5,nc,1
5,Love them,1
1,I don't like how the back side is white and it's stiff. Like a poor thread count with black ink on ones side I expected a lot more for the price,0
5,No problems. Fits well. Pretty fabric design.,1
5,"These earrings are beautiful. I get lots of compliments every time I wear them. They are a little bit heavy, but not so bad that I won't wear them.",1
3,"Hi guys,<br />I'm writing this review based on my first use of this t-shirt.<br />It fits perfect, does hold off sweat, and nice colors!<br />I do see that the finish of the product isn't that nicely.<br />But for the price, you pay they are sure superb!",0
2,"I'm so disappointed! I wanted one in every color. It's about 2 sizes smaller than listed, and the zipper is gold, not silver. Gag!",0
5,Came so soon and the picture does not do this piece justice. I absolutely love this chocker and how soft it sits on your neck. Its all smooth with no meal poking or scratching you. I get so many compliments and cant wait to get more. So sparkley,1
5,"I got a similar necklace as a gift from my sister in law and loved it so I decided to get one for my cousin. She also loves it. When I gave it to her she put it on immediately. The crystals shine so much in the sun, that is the best part! We are very girly girls so we love shine and shimmer. It draws attention to the necklace for sure. She has already had people ask where she got it from so I am sure there will be many more purchased.",1
5,"I am only a week into owning this watchband, but it is amazing!  It's comfortable, easy to put on the watch and easy to adjust, it holds firmly, and importantly, I forget I'm even wearing it for most of the day.  The watchband that came with the Sense was so uncomfortable that I never wanted to wear it - not a great feature for such an expensive accessory.  This watchband has changed everything!  For reference, I have three kids under the age of five so I use my hands a lot and my wrists get exposed to quite a bit of wear and tear.  If this band still holds well in a year, I will consider it to have achieved its full value and keep the five star rating.  I'll report back if and when it eventually wears out, hopefully that won't be for a very long time.  I definitely recommend this, especially if (like me) the original watchband is uncomfortable and you're looking for something that you can get exactly the right tightness without any discomfort.  If this review is unchanged, it means it's still going strong!<br /><br />Update: June 13th 2021<br /><br />It's been almost half a year and I've gotten my money's worth.  We have three kids under the age of 5 - this thing has held up to daily use through the pool, rogue bath dunkings, every playground in a twenty mile radius, this rambunctious toddler whose persistent combination of creativity and energy has put my wrist to the test.  It finally lost one of its velcro tabs, but the design means that the rest are still holding things in place well enough.  I suspect I'll have to replace it before the year is up, but I cannot emphasize how much wear this thing gets.  And it still looks good!  I'm posting a picture of how it still looks 6 months in.",1
4,Very cute tie! Was perfect and just what you’d expect!,1
1,Didn't look like the picture at all (the picture was different when i ordered it). I have never worn it. I ended up just donating it.,0
5,Exactly as expected.,1
5,Size,1
1,Too small returned waiting for my refund,0
5,"Love these pants!! They are super comfy, have a good deal of stretch, and I get compliments left and right. Def ordering more...might even size down to a 7 since they have so much stretch.",1
5,"Best knock-offs money can buy. These arrived in the mail well over a week before I'd expected them and although I was initially disappointed at how small they are, I changed my mind when I checked the quality. Very sturdy plastic arms, full metal construction around the lenses (complete with screws securing the metal uppers to the lower trim!) and lenses that are actually glass. Yes, that's right... glass lenses in a seven dollar pair of Clubmasters. The downside? The glass is pretty thin. After one week of rolling these guys they fell off of a chair and straight-up SHATTERED. From falling off a chair onto a ceramic tile floor. Oh well. Order another and enjoy.",1
5,I bought this to replace the Casio watch I bought while I was in boot camp. It lasted 10 years with heavy wear in the past 3 years. It has a few more features than my old one did the reason I bought it was because these watches can take some abuse and still function as well as they did right out of the box. I never had to change the battery on my old watch even though I did about a year ago and in doing so in advertently broke the gasket. This watch has a different back which requires a screwdriver to get apart. All in it works and works and works.,1
5,Good quality my granddaughters love them,1
3,Very pretty was to big Tho!,0
5,"Una predadores de ropa excelente para hacer ejercicio ,muy resistente y muy biena calidad ,amigos se las recomiendo un 100%",1
2,The seam in the forearm was not sewed together.  Therefore there is a hole the length of the forearm in the left sleeve.  I love the shirt but was extremely disappointed for the price verses quality.,0
1,Product sucks,0
1,"The wallet is cut too small.  If you use all the pockets, it's so tight, the zipper is difficult to close.  After two weeks of use, it broke.",0
5,Size was accurate. Product was well made. Very happy with purchase.,1
3,my teen love it. it her first complete jewelry.,0
5,I bought this for my boyfriend to replace a very similar one he already had. Quality is very good.,1

5,"These are really small , good for second holes or multiple pricerings.good quality and are truly 925,sterling silver. .great for children. ...",1
1,The Junior's medium is equivalent to a little girl's size 7/8.  I gave it to my 7 year old niece and it fits HER perfectly.,0
1,It was the wrong size for my phone. I need a regular 6s case,0
5,I'm a size 6 in dresses but ordered a medium and this dress fit perfectly. -Laura,1
3,The price is tempting to have work out shirts. Bought for my son for cross country- these are heavy polyester ? Not lightweight workout shirts.,0
4,A little bit thinner fabric then I hoped but the price was very low.,1
2,I thought the product was very cheaply made...the plastic was very thin and the key ring and clasp were very flimsy.,0
4,Cute booties but they run small.  I would definitely recommend to order up a size.,1
3,To loose to big which makes it to sloppy looking but the color and design of sweater are beautiful I prefer a tighter knit so it's warm when wearing it,0
4,Little touch on the feel.. but dope design,1
5,Very chic and strong. Looks great with everything my lady wears.,1
1,"Ummm. You see what I ordered and then you see what I was given!?!?! Way to go, this was a Christmas gift. Not only was the color incorrect but as was the size.",0
5,The best,1
3,Neck isn’t as wide as pic. Tight crew. Fits smaller,0
5,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this bag. It is a good quality for the price, and-yes- it does come with a little scarf just like in the picture. The wicker was a slightly lighter color than expected. The bag does have a drawstring to help secure everything inside, and the purse actually fits everything I need day-to-day!",1
5,I'am gay and this was too much.  I gave it to the neighbor lady and she adores it. Also suitable hunting attire. This thing stands out brighter then anything you can buy from Cabela's.,1
5,"I love the design which is perfect for yoga class.  It is very comfortable, is well made and the material is soft.  I love this top!",1
5,They are good and keep the sun out of my eyes,1
2,Unfortunately one of the arms came off these after only a month.,0
5,Helps with circulation and swollen ankles,1
5,It's very attractive and &#34;cool&#34; at the same time. My 15yr son doesn't like wearing a wrist watch so he wanted a pocket watch. This is even better looking than the picture. He says it even glows in the dark.,1
3,Love the fit and looks sexy but it is see-through.  I expected to wear some pasties but now I'm going to have to figure something else out.,0
5,This dress is beautiful and the price was great too.<br />I'm 5'5 and 130 pounds and I ordered a size small and it fits nice.,1
5,"I'm super impressed with the quality of this bag. The material is nice and thick and the pattern is cute! There is a nice inside pocket. The opening is a little narrow, but it is perfect for fitting a notebook in.",1

3,Pretty ring but very heavy and thick.  Better as thumb ring only.,0
3,Runs small,0
5,"Love it!!💝🙏thanks so much... Excellent product quality, professional customer service & prompt delivery.",1
2,The 3X was still too small even though I normally where 2X.,0
1,This item was poorly made. The clasp broke twice and then I only received 80% of my refund due to post office delays. Bad experience and don’t recommend.  DEFINITELY not worth the 85 dollars.,0
4,"A bit shorter than perfect length, and the fact that they attach on the handles themselves rather than the tips of the handles, may be detractors for some.  Other than these, they work fine.",1
1,Didn’t work for my toddlers.  They refused to wear it.  Returned it.,0
3,I really wanted to like this dress. The color is great. The fit between bust and shoulders needs to be precise and it was somehow both too small and too big for me at the same time.,0
3,"These looked & fit just about perfect on my 3 year old nephew! However after about 2 hours of wear, the pin fell out of the clip so it no longer clamps closed.",0
4,My mom likes it,1
5,Bought them for my Princess Jasmine Cosplay,1
5,Loved the vibrant color. Fit just as indicated. It was flattering and slimming. I would buy again in another color.,1
4,Very nice small front pocket wallet. I appreciate the little coin slots which I keep a few quarters in. The construction is decent the material is too. I suspect I will get close to a year of daily use out of it. This is the only type of wallet I use and this one is a pretty decent one.,1
2,"I got this for my daughter.  The same day she got it, the jingles started falling off.  We love the sound, but after wearing it for only 4 days, shes down to 4 jingles on them. I wouldn't recommend buying this.",0
4,Short but my daughter just wears short underneath.,1
3,Very tight. Cuts off the circulation in my arm.,0
2,"They fit great, and look like expected. I would give 5 stars BUT they are unraveling at the top of the lace part. I feel they are going to burst... They are NOT tight at all...I actually should have gotten a smaller size.... I'm going to return them and reorder and hopefully I'll get a better pair.",0
1,Not at all what pictured when placed the order. Very disapointed that i have to pay money to even to ship back. Because i don't have access to a printer.,0
4,I really like and it looks good on my bracelet.,1
5,I bought this as a cover up for a beach trip. I needed to pack light and this fits the bill.,1
2,Sewn very badly. Crooked. Good material bad sewing4,0
5,"Was skeptical buying these initially as there was only 1 review before my purchase. But after using for 2 weeks for work and even swimming in these, I'd recommend them. No issues as of yet !",1
5,"Great stylish boots, comfortable look great with jeans.",1
4,"Really only meant for a one time use. Used for a wedding and they held out through the ceremony and all the pictures, as othwr reviewa shares, mine as well started cracking where the heel pushes, which is when my heels came off anyways and I changed into flats. They did the job I needed them to do and they weren't noticable. They fit my heel right and didn't wreck my heels.",1
1,Fits very small.,0
2,Second time wearing it after 1 wash it’s ripping. 😢,0
4,"It is crazy that the battery is rated to last seven years, but the strap cracks in two or three years, but the  cost of replacing the watch band alone is about the same as buying a whole new watch. We live in a disposable society. The watch is perfect with a chronometer, stopwatch, and it is good for swimming. Can’t beat the watch But I wish that the watchband lasted as long as the battery.  I now have 3 of these watches that are still running, but only this new one has a band that I can wear.",1
4,We bought this for my daughter. She was very happy with the product.,1
1,It was eh . At least I got my refund because it wasn’t really a good material and all broke,0
1,I ordered a 3XL and it was more like a large.  Very disappointed.,0
4,"I lost one of my Tiffany earrings and came across these.  I love them.  Great value and they look exactly like the one that I lost!!!! I would have given a higher score.  However, just like the one I lost, you will need a larger back for support or they will &#34;droop&#34;.",1
1,"Based on on other reviews I must have received cheap substitutes - the socks I received did fit well, but are very thin (top & bottom).  I won’t this brand again.",0

3,Real comfy but not too much support.,0
5,Very nice belt. Good quality for the price. I love the design,1
5,"This case is very good quality and the storage bays are very large. I have a large collection of Oakley sunglasses and have had a difficult time finding a quality storage case large enough to hold them. Even the Oakley Radar series fits with plenty of room to spare. The inside is lined with a very soft felt material. I don't place my Oakley's lens down, but it appears soft enough to keep from damaging high end shades.",1
5,For my Granddaughter Birthday she loved it,1
5,"just want i needed for my little guy. nice look, he loved it.",1
5,I just loved this necklace was everything that i was looking for.,1
5,These masks are some of the most comfy ones I have bought and as a bonus the masks came on the date promised.  They fit great and more importantly the elastic doesn't hurt behind my ears.  If they start offering other fabric options I will buy more since they are reasonably priced.  I am very happy with my purchase.,1
2,"Liked the ring design liked the stone size but did not like the stone, a teeny tiny sliver of fire on one edge tge rest brown!!!!! Not as depicted online, contacted company they responded that &#34;fire opal&#34; is like that!<br />I didnt buy a fire opal I thought i was purchasing a Mexican fire agate!!!!! as shown Returning it. Two stars one for the design one for stone size minus five for saying it was a Fire Agate when it wasnt!!!",0
5,"Bought for my teenage daughter, she loves it.",1
5,Love this dress. It’s simple but highly flattering and can easily be dressed up or down.,1
5,The time looked exactly as pictured and seems well made. The case and the lens cloth are vibrant and perfect for Superman fans,1
5,"Really worth buying. Soft fabric, elegant look and unbelievable comfort wearing it. Super happy about this purchase and totally recommend it!!!!!!!!",1
3,Gift for my grand daughter.,0
1,I ordered this for Valentine’s Day bags for my class. Only received 6 of the bags!,0
3,Not as spectacular as in the photos,0
1,cheapest pair of earrings I ever seen or had.  Save your money!!!,0
1,"Purchased this as gift for my husband,  he really liked the watch. The problem is that watch does not keep time. Its either running fast or slow. Thought maybe the battery needs to be changed. Looked at the sellers listed information, states 1- Lr44 battery.  Dont waste your time going out and buying one, the sellers listed information in false. This takes 2 batteries and neither are a Lr44 battery. Very disappointed to give my husband a gift that doesn't work correctly, and having to waste my time buying a battery that isn't even used in the watch. I Will be returning this product. Don't waste your time(no pun intended) with this watch.",0
3,"I liked the variety and the price of these mustaches. I also liked that they came with the different types grouped together and not all jumbled in the package. However, the paper backing was difficult to peel off and I ruined some while trying to get this off. They also had a strong chemical smell straight out of the packaging.",0
2,Very cute but breaks easily,0
3,"This item is raw and detailed. It's super awesome, but broke almost instanttk wearing.",0
1,This was a horrible purchase! I ordered the dress and ended up with a shirt that looked nothing like the same print or material and was definitely not the dress!,0
5,Value for the money is high looks like more expensive watch!,1
5,This is such a cute dress.  Every time I wear it I get tons of compliment.  Material is substantial and it’s fairly comfortable.  I’m really happy with this purchase.,1
1,"When I first received the glasses I was IN LOVE. The style, the cut, the color everything was amazing, until day 3 when I put them on and they just came apart. The screws came off and I ended up with two halves of a pair of sunglasses it was pretty disappointing",0
5,We love these cute water shoes! Perfect for beach or pool to protect gentle little feet!,1
4,Great hat but had to be aired out due to the bad smell. Otherwise just as described and protects great.,1
3,Order 2 sizes up if you want a loose fit. I ordered 1 size up and it was still tight.,0
5,thank you..,1
4,These are nice polarized sunglasses for the money. I like the style and fit.,1
5,"My first time using lower compression socks, and love them!",1
3,"Overall good piece, but it is slightly different than pictured. The color is more forest green and it is more leathery than you expect. Color is slightly different on the edges and back. The back mesh is more red. But overall good and fits in the chest very well.",0
3,Returning. Not high quality. Nice pic tho,0
5,My mother was love,1
1,This mask are super thin not the best!,0
4,"These are a bit stronger than the ones I had previously. I think they will last longer.  I tend to drop my sunglasses a lot and sit on them or lose them.  I like to drive with them, as they calm my eyes.  It's hard to say &#34;I love&#34; a pair of sunglasses, but I do like them.",1
5,Nice,1
5,feels and looks great,1
4,My granddaughter loved them. She wears a 2T and I’m glad I took the advice of other buyers and ordered the 5T. The shirt fits perfectly but the pants blouse some over the cuff.,1
5,I hate shopping for hats because most stores carry only those with somebody's logo on it. I do not want to be a walking billboard for a sports team or product AND have to pay the royalty for the privilege of doing so. No thanks! Plain and simple does it for me.,1
1,The dress I received is completely different than the picture. It has a lace bodice and high back. It’s also much more red than burgundy. Fabric is thin and the lace is basically see-through.,0
1,bad metal!,0
5,Good quality. Lasts and well made. Size and fit just right for me.,1
1,Can not use my phone while wearing them,0
5,"Yes, small to medium purse. Great if you don't have to carry a lot, however I notice I can put anything in this purse and I always have enough room. There are a lot of nooks and crannies in this purse.",1
3,This dress is very pretty and fit very well except for the bust. I  have another dress from this maker that fits fine all over.  Don't know what happened with this.,0
3,cant really rate it good because I don't have it..guess it is taking so long that I ordered my mom something else for mothers day,0
4,I'm a starwars fan I really like the quality and details of my ring big heavy duty ring,1
3,"the watch size is much larger than I anticipated so it is a little uncomfortable and feels oversized, but the watch works well.",0
5,It's absolutely perfect!!,1
5,Life Saver,1
4,A nice collection of rings for the price; I like most of the stones. Be warned that they are made in China and seem a bit shorter than the average navel bar!,1
5,my mom loves it,1
5,I purchased this cute summer dress for my oldest daughter. She absolutely loved it. Was good quality and a cute little sundress with a perfect sunflower print.,1
5,great product,1
5,Works great jewelry really shines.,1
2,Cute boots but the strap broke literally a month after having them. It was days after the return window closed. She maybe wore them less than a dozen times. So disappointed.  Wouldn’t recommend.,0
3,"The fabric is good and it fit my booty, hips, thighs, calves, all of that nicely.  However, there was a little too much extra space in the front that made them kinda saggy, only in the front. Almost like they were made for men. Stinks because the color is beautiful and the material is nice. I like to tuck my shirts in, but if you like longer, flowy shirts, than this product would be great for you!",0
5,Love it a beautiful handsome carrying bag for a very well-dresses dapper man like myself,1
5,Great gloves. Fit well and sturdy,1
4,"This shirt is very pretty and soft. The flower decals don’t seem to be stocked on super well, so I would be careful when laundering (maybe turn it inside out so that the decals don’t get roughed up too much?) Very flattering and comfortable.",1
1,"Very thin, not durable. After one wash, it shrunk. And 35$ for this is purely waste of money. Quality is so cheap, cheap and cheap. Absolute waste.",0
5,Beautiful little necklace,1
3,This needs to be ordered  way bigger so it hangs like the picture.,0
5,"So far these have done exactly as I hoped they would. All I really want from underwear is that they become completely effortless and thoughtless. If I have to think about them due to riding up, too tight in the junk, seams falling apart, etc then they have failed. None of that has happened with this purchase. I needed a reminder to review them because I had already stopped thinking about them. After several turns through the wash I have no broken seams. I have very little shrinkage. I have no issues with riding up my leg and no constriction happening in the 'man parts'. I am planning to make another purchase and throw out a few other pairs that are constantly making me think of them!<br /><br />Last comment... Girlfriend said 'those make your junk look huge'. Nice to hear that!",1
2,These slippers are so cute . I am just so very sorry they did not fit. They were way too small. So sad.,0
5,I bought this dress for my sister's engagement party and it came out to be perfect ..it needed some alteration bcuz of the size but she looked great in it,1
5,"My boyfriend loved these boxers, fit great and as expected (ordered a large).",1
5,Quality!,1
1,These are too small! They don't fit and I actually ordered a half size larger than needed.  The slippers are cute but what does it even matter if they don't even fit.,0
5,It was very  good 👍,1
5,"Bought this for my granddaughter.  .  She wears it all the time.....works as a sleep shirt too.  Have to order two more, one for sleep, one for play and she'll have one to wear for school.  Fabric is soft and the decal isn't stiff and smell like some others are.  Extremely pleased.",1
3,"We used them for over a year with no problem, but on our last trip both the handle on the side and on the top broke. The plastic connector between the handle strap and the case snapped. Other than that we liked them.",0
3,Rather well,0
5,"[[VIDEOID:f00c4f4892f1b17b01206b30d5de7267]] I purchased 2 matching bands for my husband and I to wear in lieu of our original wedding rings. We work on a farm and are always banging our hands around and getting them dirty with oil, mud, cow poo, hydraulic fluid, and general farm goop. Its so much easier to wash frequently and sanitize your hands with a silicone band on. I love the camo design for sure!!",1
5,Replaced a pair of laces in expensive Nike shoes. These held up great.,1
5,"I love the material, the stretch/mobility. I recommend this pants to a friend and plan to get more. I haven't washed them yet so hopefully all goes well. Check this out.",1
3,"I was SOOOOO excited about getting these. I literally ripped open the package the second they were delivered and wore them all weekend hiking and snowboarding. They felt soooo similar to Lulu aligns and had the same stitching, similar logo in the same place, and even the same long skinny tags. HOWEVER, I just washed them (with all of my actual lululemon clothes with the Lulu recommended way of machine wash cold and air dry) and there’s a random patch with significant pilling and the stitching all frayed. I’m hoping I just got a bad pair but am disappointed at the quality post first wash.",0
4,Love the fit and hold. Not too tight as other tummy control products tend to be.,1
1,There was no inside lining just scratchy material right on your skin do not recommend,0
4,Kinda long and weird looking on my face. Great materials though!,1
2,This is very poorly designed and sewn! Don’t buy! Looks like a 3rd grader did it. Pretty color though. I’ll be returning. If it wasn’t so loose at the bottom I might consider keeping it but it fits so weirdly.,0
3,"You have to wash in cold water and hang dry. Or else they will get those little fuzzies all over... my navy pair actually started to do it, the first time I wore them :/ I really like these. Going to try to find another brand elsewhere.",0
3,great fit but too thick of material. Cant breathe or even talk through them.,0
2,Material was not as expected and the fit was very strange. I was looking for work out pants but these were not it.,0
5,Love this blue watch. Its big but still comfortable to wear,1
5,Love love love this title so awesome. Would recommend to anyone that is a wrestling/stone cold fan,1
3,This was cute except for the fact I ordered a brown and black one and received a blue one. Will most likely return and try again. Hopefully I’ll get the right one.,0
5,This shirt fits great.  It is slimmer than regular fit but not crazy slim like some.  I'm 5'9 170lbs (no belly) and the large was perfect.,1
3,"I bought these for my 3 year old and they were a little big as I expected, but my real issue is that they stretch out a lot! He wears them for an hour and they are stretched out around the leg holes thus riding up his butt. The material is very soft so I imagine it's comfortable, I just wish it didn't stretch out so fast.",0
1,The analogue arms stop working a week after my kid used it . And they block the digital clock view .. I do not recommend buying it,0
2,It's okay. It looks nice at first but it the material wrinkles with wear and the clasp starting to irritate my skin after a few hours.,0
4,"Nice bag, cool design.<br />Small compartment is very narrow.<br />There are no double zippers which makes it difficult to operate with one hand.",1
4,Super cute look just like the pictures.,1
5,So flattering. I tie a knot at the top because it was a little too baggy for my liking. I always get so many compliments and it is beyond comfortable.,1
3,"These PJs were very cute! But I had to return them because the material was extremely thin, and the fit was a little on the ""small"" side.",0
5,These were a hot.,1
3,Quality is good and looks good. I did buy a size up to allow for shrinkage and boy did it ever in the length! I would say it shrank a good 4-5&#34;. It now falls 2&#34; below my knees which leaves my legs cold. I'm thinking about buying add'l flannel to add to the bottom for more length.,0
3,"Seemed like a nice blouse, just big",0
5,"Cute little steth. ID tag pin for medical student/EMT/Nurse...basic quality for the price, good bright red enamel color on stainless steel (not gold) metal pin.❤️",1
2,well made and very pretty but runs entirely too small.  You may have to order 1 or 2 sizes larger.,0
5,Gift for mom she loved it,1
5,Loved the dress.,1
5,"This dress is perfect, it fits everywhere perfectly!  I am 5’ 0”, 123 pounds bought a medium.  Not tight, not loose, so very comfortable!  The ties allow you to adjust to your liking.<br />Going to buy another color right now!’",1
5,"My daughter hates socks and shoes, but she will wear these. They’re so cute! Will be buying the next size up for sure",1
4,"This hat is very cute.  I've been looking for something similar for more than a year.  I'd have liked it to be just a little looser in the weave, and the headband part of the hat is quite a bit smaller than the overall circumference, so if you don't wear it just right you can end up looking like you have a mushroom on your head.  Overall just the right amount of warm, style and comfort on walks in cool (but not frigid) weather.",1
2,I like the design- and thought it would be more opalescent and in the shades shown in photo- it is very vivid and bright in person and looks like thin plastic- I haven't worn it as it doesn't go with what I'd intended-,0
2,Material is already pulling after a few washes and fading. Runs small.,0
5,"Although this wallet made me reconfigure where I kept everything, I love the shiny exterior - it lets the wallet slip into and out of my wallet easily.  Growing to love this more every day!",1
1,When my package arrived everything looked normal but when I opened the plastic and unfolded the scarf I immediately saw these huge holes. Although the other scarf was perfectly fine I am still very disappointed.,0
5,"Great cover-up, wonderful color.",1
5,Sooo sparkly! I wear it everyday. Highly recommend!,1
3,"This skirt is nicely made and it fit me well but the fabric itself was much more stiff and shiny than I was expecting. I'm 5'8&#34; and it hits just below my knee and I ordered my size based on the sizing chart provided. I will be returning it because I don't like that there isn't much movement in the fabric, but that is only a personal preference of mine. Overall it's a nice skirt, just not what I specifically wanted.",0
2,"stretches funny after washing - good concept, just doesn't work so well in reality",0
2,The material is see through. So I guess I will wear it to the beach some day.,0
5,Perfect,1
3,The shoes are well made and are worth the price but run a half size small,0
3,"I really like the flexibility in the legs and seat. However, the waist is not flexible; the place where it’s needed the most. I will likely be returning these.",0
3,The shirt style/material is good but sizing is not true to size. Runs small.,0
5,Makes me a BoomerSooner!,1
2,"I like a cross body handbag, I can put over and forget about it getting in the way, or losing it. I like ones that have an area that you can put often used cards, as well as cash so that you don't need to pull out a wallet. It has all these things. Yet I'm not happy, the strap is uncomfortably wide and the edges are sharp. I'm keeping it with the hope I may find a slender folded strap, a woman can hope.",0
3,"this is so so. i could have gotten better, more realistic looking ones than these. the size and description fit but it looks kinda cheap",0
5,Pretty top. Fit is perfect.  Price is great.,1
1,Don’t like.. wasn’t cute. Kinda cheap looking. Returned,0
1,This bracelet arrived with a stone missing and rather &#34;cheap&#34; looking - not worth the price,0
1,Too small & poor quality material. If you need a large order a 2X.,0
4,"This Casual Hoodie is soft,  comfortable, good quality product and fashion european style, but in the picture it looks better than in reality, although it is still a very good zippered sweatshirt.",1
5,I absolutely love Vince Carter. Best $120 I've ever spent. Exactly what I've been looking for.,1
1,Wasn't what I thought at all. I returned these,0
1,Not sure if truly stainless steel because one nose ring arrived with the silver chipped off and a brown rusty color underneath. The stones are cute but can't have nose rings that chip.,0
2,There just made from pieces of material. That's not even sewn on the ends.,0
5,"Loved the product. It was as expected. Fitted my 2year old niece very well. My niece is alittle bigger than normal. This product fits children ages 3-7 years old. I don’t regret buying this hat. Very soft, clean, no bad odor, and easy to wash and wear.",1
1,"These are the worst I have evet worn . Terrible terrible design, how can you mess up a pair of boxer briefs. Unbelievable.",0
2,Love the colors but too little for my nose,0
2,They were extremely small. They were given to my son who is wheelchair bound. Ordered a larger size and they weren’t that comfortable. He’s going to use another company.  They are attractive but not functional for him.,0
5,Fabric is soft and it fits just how i wanted. I got it as a backup Halloween accessory but I will be wearing it regularly. Best Amazon clothing purchase ever!,1
5,I haven't taken them off since I've gotten them. Pretty and feminine!,1
4,Perfect for office or weekend event,1
3,Smaller than expected.  Bought the medium for my six year old and barely got it over his head.,0
2,"The sole of the water shoe is shaped like a cartoon foot, not an actual human baby foot. When my son wears them he trips because of the oddly designed sole.",0
1,The clasp works okay but the ring is much bigger than i ordered. I ordered a 18g 11mm and the ring is the same as my earrings (16g) and wont fit in my nose. I measured it and its also about 14mm not 11 so yeah definitely not what i ordered and cannot use it for my nose which is was meant for.,0
1,There is no way anyone would classify this material as being a sweater.  It's like the material you find when being a halloween costume.  Don't waste your time.  Very deceptive.,0
2,Very narrow opening. Hard to get fingers in there.,0
5,"I am a personal trainer and wear the watch daily.  It has been about two weeks and no scratches or fading.  The watch keeps its time throughout the day while I’m wearing it.<br /><br />CON: The only con is my watch stopped working at night (after sleeping).  Easy fix, I place it in a watch winder at night.  Problem solved.",1
1,Cheaply made Asian knockoff. Threads coming undone. Much too tight. Ordered one size up and it was still child’s size.,0
5,These are just too cute and fit so nice!,1
1,I can barely put my lower arm in this pants..,0
3,Beautiful will break easily,0
5,Absolutely Love it - Great bag,1
5,Great fabric fits perfectly like I was expected.  And it is beautiful,1
3,Returned this because it was too stretchy so it was too big for me.,0
1,The material is horrible.,0
1,Really terrible fit - and when I finally got it right the snap thingy broke. Quality = 0. Wish they had negative stars.  No way to put plastic back on - tore when it came off. Bet a man designed this :/,0
2,Used for putting chains and binders on equipment and the palm material tore from moderate use,0
4,"Very bright and cute.  It is a little snug, but still works.",1
5,"I love this eyeglass case.  I only wear glasses when I am on my computer for hours or reading a book.  This case is sturdy, looks girly (which I love) and I have received compliments on it.",1
5,Gorgeous bracelet. Love the healing properties of lava rock. It's very luxurious looking.,1
5,Beautiful!!,1
3,Cute,0
3,Material was too thick and it ripped so easily,0
1,"I wore this bracelet once and one of the tiger eye beads fell off.  It rolled off somewhere and since I couldn't find it, the bracelet is useless. That's too bad since it was pretty and a great size for my small wrist.",0
1,"This things shape and hem was a mess<br /> Looked like a 5 year old stitched it together. The slit/leg part was crooked and looked ridiculous. In general this item was just poorly made with low quality material and design.  It did provide a lot of comic relief as I tried it on for friends. This was my first &#34;oh my gosh dont order clothes on the Internet &#34; experience.  Luckily, I know its not always bad.",0
3,Says XL...more like medium US size.....quality and print are good.,0
5,Nice charm.,1
4,fits well but wish it was not so shiny.,1
5,"EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. NOT TOO LARGE, AND SO PRETTY",1
5,"These are perfect for my 10yo who is small for his age (probably closer to an 8yo.) I wanted something for eye protection that looked athletic, but wasn’t going to make me sick when he lost or misplaced them. They are great!",1
5,The material is soft and flowing.  Has a nice fit without being too snub.  Great dress for many occasions.,1
1,"I waited 4 weeks for my ring. I was really excited to receive it. I NEVER buy jewelry for myself, ever. When the ring arrived, I was happy with the ring (metal) portion of it. The tongs that hold the ""stone"": in place were a tad roungh on my skin, but I am sure wear would have smoothed that.<br />but the stone...IT IS FAKE. So clearly FAKE, and a really bad one. Cleary plastic or some kind of resin. At the price that I was paying and the small size of the stone, I thought that I would be getting a real stone, its FAKE.<br />BUY FROM SOMEONE ELSE- THEY SELL FAKES>",0
5,Fine hat did it’s job,1
5,Love this shirt!  Fits great and I get compliments every time I wear it.,1
1,Band broke after 2 months. Split wear the band attaches to watch. Watch fell of wrist to ground....,0
3,"Love this outfit! Only downfall is the arm do NOT stay off the shoulder. It rides up onto your shoulder which really bothers me because I bought it because I was looking for off the shoulder. It has beautiful vibrant colors and a flattering fit. I'm a curvy girl at 5' 5"" and 162 lbs and I got a large",0
1,"Would’ve been a great product if they fit. I ordered these thinking they were the same size I had on, definitely not. These are way thicker than the ones I usually wear therefore they serve no purpose for me.",0
5,"I liked the look of these slippers but more I wear, I noticed they aren't very anti-slip proof. I have almost slid and fell several times around house on hard wood floors and tile floors. I am elderly and worry about falls. I will probably buy again, only because I like the style of the shoes.",1
5,"Loved these! Elegant, classy, professional. Not a petite earring, will fill up your whole earlobe. I wear these with my hair up.",1
3,Super cute outfit however extremely see through!,0
5,Was pleasantly surprised. I used it to close a three quarter coat that had no buttonholes. It gave shape to the coat and me😊,1
5,"This horse tee is beautiful,arrived at my daughters house fit very nice,she loves it!! Thank you so much!",1
2,Tiny. I ordered xxl. It didn't come close. Too bad. Cute shirt. I wear a 12 typically.,0
4,It’s cute. Not my favorite thing. Would have been better in black. Seems like good quality though.,1
2,"This dress technically fit, however it was awkwardly sewn and bunched sloppily at the chest.  I am not sure if it would happen on a smaller chested woman. Returned item.",0
1,It ripped as soon as my husband put it on his arm.  Horrible quality!,0
2,Cheap cloth material,0
1,What the send is a knock off of what is in the image. The shade of pink on the sleeve and pocket DO NOT match the pink on the rest of the shirt!!! What?!? It's a dusty rose on the main part of the shirt and the pocket and sleeves are a hot bubble gum pink,0
5,Works great for bracelets,1
5,This item arrived quickly and works perfectly with the Fitbit Blaze.<br /><br />I hardly ever take it off and it is very comfortable and looks very nice.,1
1,The dress was falling apart at the seams. I return it for a refund,0
5,The quality was tired just like I thought it it would,1
5,Just as expected. Gave them to my husband as a wedding gift.,1
5,Fathers Day gift,1
3,Tunic fit as expected. Trim area was a little tight.,0
5,"We love them. Easy to put on, good support.",1
5,I am 5’2 115 lbs - slender/athletic. I could fit into the extra small but it was def too tight. I’m returning for the small. Overall the dress is well made and if the small fits better I like how it hugs your body.,1
2,same as other bad quality jewelry,0
4,"I love this shirt. It has my cat's face all over it and while he doesn't appreciate it that much, it really makes for a fun Cat Shirt Friday at work.",1
4,I liked the padding but for a large they're way too small,1
5,I wear it all the time! It fits great.,1
1,Not good,0
5,My wife like them very much,1
1,Broke too quick,0
1,Super cute but bad quality. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing the shirt the seams on the bottom of the shirt had fully came apart.,0
2,Ordered a medium. Tag says XL. Way to big but cute,0
4,"I adore these! Not the best quality of material but for the price, don’t think you can beat it!",1
2,"The print job on this shirt is very poor quality. It has started coming off after one wash, and that's washing it inside out and not using the dryer. Looks like it's gonna become a yard shirt pretty soon. Shame, too, because this is one of my favorite music groups.",0
5,"Great water shoes, I think I ordered wrong so they slightly longer then my son needs but hes wearing them for a second summer now, they have held up very well and the color still looks great.",1
5,Wore this under a poodle skirt for a 50s Sockhop- it was perfect!,1
1,They are to big. Won’t order that style again. Very disappointed.,0
1,It took a long time to arrive. The bracelet has the hook on the same side of the charm which makes it difficult to put on. It’s cute but not practical.,0
5,Very well made! So well made that it looks as if it was hand knitted.,1
1,Don’t buy this is NOT Korean made it’s from china,0
1,I love Reebok products but these shorts didn't fit well at all and they didn't have compression as stated.,0
5,Cute..the right size for going out at night..can dress up an outfit or make cute casual..,1
1,"Received this the end of January, broke today",0
5,"Perfect Church dress , fits perfectly.  I wear a size 12/14 in dresses I ordered an XL & it fit perfectly .",1
5,Purchased based on Instagram @TheSueStyleFile recommendation and I absolutely love it.,1
2,Decent looking pant. Horrible size accommodation. I couldn't even guess the right for if there even were one.,0
1,"The item was almost empty when it arrived, box and cloth were soaked. I was able to use it once and seems like it will work fine but very disappointed.",0
3,"Girls sweatshirt, runs small order up a size or 2.",0
5,"Good looking shirt.  Would have preferred it to be a bit softer, but it's still nice.",1
5,My 15yr old granddaughter has chronic pain in her joints . I purchased the bracelet hoping it will relieve some pain. Fingers crossed!,1
1,"Love the style, but too small for me. Slit is up up to your underwear.",0
1,Very weak material used.  Strap broke before a month old.,0
5,"I love this watch. It is light and fits comfortably. Because I am female with a smaller wrist than the average man, I had to have a few links removed, but it took the jeweler only a couple of minutes without any issues.<br /><br />This watch is beautiful. It is elegant and simple, and yet rustic enough to appeal to a wide variety of tastes. I love what Lux Woods stands for, and it is great knowing that I've purchases a wonderful product from a company dedicated to giving back to their community. I will be buying more items from Lux Woods in the future.",1
1,"As another buyer pointed out, the quality is low and they fall apart quickly. These lasted me about a month, if that, before the bottom of the right boot just started falling off. I bought these in December and by January they had fallen apart. I wasn't wearing them daily either. They didn't even last the season. Very disappointed.",0
5,Product fits great and material is nice and light!! Would definitely recommend!!,1
4,"Love these earings!! Nice and lightweight, large so they get noticed and so pretty! Only downfall is they don't come with backs. I had to get plastic backs because they are so lightweight when my jacket pushed it they fell out.",1
5,"sold as a large - fits as a medium of small might  - go up approx one or 2 sizes if available , typical of imported goods  - construction and material are ok for the price",1
1,"Very cheap quality, the valves getting loose and steam comes over my face, I’ll like to get a credit refund, I’m not happy at all.",0
2,It's pretty but came soooooo knotted was never able to wear it! So basically a waste of money,0
5,Nice work and came fast thank you  guys,1
5,Very happy with purchase!,1
3,Not the best quality. Still works. Don't think I would buy another one.,0
5,These are comfortable and look great! They're different but not weird.,1
3,Very cheaply made. Fabric was more silky and with less body/form than shown in pic. Would only really work with small bust/skinny body type,0
3,My husband likes this shirt but it is very thin,0
5,the price was right.,1
4,"This is an adorable dress! I do think it runs a little on the small side. I'm typically a size 12/14 so I figured the XL would be perfect, maybe even a little loose. But while I could zip up the dress it was a little tight in the chest, and my bust isn't even very big at a 34C. So I would recommend going a size up to get a great fit! Which is why I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise the dress itself is gorgeous and really I could wear it to a formal or casual event. I'll be ordering in more colors for sure!",1
4,Its glittery!  My granddaughter imediately put it on and won't take it off.  She loved it!  But be prepared there will be giltter everywhere!,1
1,I prefer a loose fit so I bought a 2XL (I wear a XL) shirt fits like a large. I figured it would be cheap but the material is very uncomfortable.,0
1,Too small and too bulky,0
5,Great quality Perfect sizing My son loves them❤️💯,1
4,I’ve had it maybe a month and the black lettering has worn to silver so it’s hard to read,1
3,very long,0
2,Missing one of the long charms and one of the necklaces isn’t attached to the others. Will probably try to fix myself and find a charm for it. Hopefully it’ll still turn out pretty.,0
5,Lovely for a gift.,1
5,Like it,1
5,Works as advertized.,1
2,I did not like wording on one of the masks.,0
4,It's super cute but some of the stitching around the waistline was off. I did an emergency repair so I could wear it when I got it and plan on rest itching that area by hand and doing a better job of it so it doesn't show. I hid the area with a belt.  The other slight imperfection is what they list as the bust measurement. I followed their sizing guide but the bust area came out roomier than expected. That surprising for a 38DD. I'll probably end up buying another dress from this maker (a size down) because they are so reasonably priced but I'll definitely afford myself time to fix any imperfections before wearing next time.,1
1,Medium is so small!!!  I had leg pain at work! I had to cut the top part in order to get through the day!!! And I always ordered size medium for my compretion socks!,0
2,Too heavy,0
5,great gift,1
5,I love this bag! Perfect size and the pattern in beautiful. Just what I had hoped for,1
2,Thin material; you will see your bra through this even if it’s white or nude.  Not impressed.,0
5,Gorgeous dress.  Very nice quality.  Fit was perfect.  Arrived in great time.  Would buy from this seller again.,1
5,"I've seen complaints that this item is TOO thin.  COMPARED TO WHAT? This is the 21st Century.  LAYERING has been around for a while now. This item is supposed to be ONLY ONE LAYER OF MANY.<br /><br />They even called the item TECHNICAL, so IT WAS MADE TO BE USED AS LAYERING.<br /><br />I use a silk weight Polartec base layer underneath it or a Polartec waffle weave on top of it and it becomes the base layer.<br /><br />Another thing about the 21st Century: COTTON, and other water soaking materials, ARE OUT.",1
2,My daughter is 5 months and the coat is too big,0
2,"Did not experience much difference in normal night driving and driving with these glasses.<br /><br />Some of the oncoming headlight glare from the brighter, white Xenon lights being sold nowadays were slightly minimized, but other than that, not much else to speak of.<br /><br />There was a slight flaw outside the direct field of vision on one of the lenses which should not have made through a quality standards check.  The case, screwdriver, and packaging were nice though.",0
5,"Great suspenders for the groom and groomsmen!  Price was right and this product was what we hoped for. Groom, best man, groomsmen and ring bearer all wore the same look.",1
5,"With this watch link and the link remover I was able to repair a watch that had been lying around my house. Since there were 18 different sizes, I was able to find one with just the right size. The quality of the links and tool seems to be really good since they are made of stainless steel. It comes with a soft cloth and all the watch links come separated in a plastic container.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and my opinion is based on my personal experience. I test the product thoroughly for some time before giving a review and I do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions.

4,A little small. I can only wear them on my pinkie finger.,1
1,Dislike. Will never order again. Rusted up in a short period of time.,0
5,Soft and fits as expected.  My new favorite shirt.,1
4,I bought these for my 11yr old son and they fit him perfectly. The material is nice and soft but doesn't feel like it'll rip easily.,1
1,Shipping/Delivery was super SLOOOOOW!<br />Bad design!<br />Cheap material!<br />Poorly made!<br />Don't waste your money!!,0
3,After reading the reviews that this wrap ran small I decided to order this wrap in 2 sizes too big. When I received the wrap I thought surely it will fit because I ordered it so big. Sadly it didn’t fit at all still. If you’re planning to buy this I’d make sure to order way bigger than you think you’ll need.,0
5,I loved the material on this dress. Super soft and easy to wear. I was grateful that it was not too thin. Hangs beautifully.,1
1,I wish I could give it zero star. Don’t buy it!,0
2,Although the over all quality is very nice the elastic  in the upper part is just too tight.. i am under weight & have very thin legs and they are even too tight for me. I need socks but sadly i think because of this i’ll have to give them all away.,0
4,"I sized up but was still too tight,",1
1,Small. Print not vivid. Blurry.,0
5,Love the softness of the material. Very comfortable. The pletes make this a very flattering fit.,1
2,Looks like the picture but is silky and very thin. Not something I would like to use in the kitchen.,0
1,they are cheap looking and cheaply made. Would not recommend.,0
2,Very small.,0
5,Soft cloth and unique pattern,1
5,"I hadn't realized these earrings are larger than regular earrings as far as going in my ear piercings. So they were just too big at first, I had to get my piercings enlarged just a tad.",1
5,love the rings they fit perfect,1
5,Great dress! Received lots of compliments! Nobody could believe it was from Amazon!,1
1,"Ordered a womens small, received a mens small. Returned.",0
2,I ordered two of these at the same time. One worked fine.  The other I could never get the time set on because two of the buttons were stuck.  Me and my husband both tried everything we could think of and never got it to work.  Very disappointing,0
5,Just wore these for the first time today. I got a lot of compliments. They are festive happy and cute,1
1,If I could give this no stars I would. These are the worst sunglasses I’ve ever purchased! It also took over 3 months to get them. I’ve had better sunglasses purchased from Walmart! So not even worth the small amount I paid for them.,0
1,Returned it,0
1,Does not look like the picture,0
3,"Thought I’d found the holy grail for picky child with wide feet who prefers shoes without laces, but unfortunately the Velcro is a bit short, so these are gonna need me to figure something out for my son to be able to wear them. They look amazing though and great price.",0
5,"I have gotten a ton of compliments on this shirt. The sizing fits perfectly, I'm 5'9&#34; and bought an XL. The arms and rest of the shirt are well fit to a standard XL. Also, the material is super soft and stretchy... always a bonus! I've seen reviews on this brand that the quality isn't great, I'll tell you, it's not the best I've bought . But for the price, the quality is outstanding..",1
2,"The tag says 95% cotton and 5% polyester.  The interior of the shirt seemed more cotton-like, but the exterior of the shirt looks and feels like polyester.  The shirt fit well, but was not flattering on a large sized body.",0
5,Very satisfied.,1
1,"The glasses are very flimsy and it's hard to bend ear piece to fit your ear. One pair came with the nose guard missing. I tried to send them back, but I had trouble doing that. Very unhappy with the purchase, don't waste your money.",0
5,This swimsuit is just too cute on my 14 year old! She loves it! I thought it was nice cuz it covers while letting some skin show! Modest enough! It also came earlier than expected!!,1
2,It didn't look as pink as the picture,0
1,Did not fit on pandora  bracelet as advertised.,0
5,"Fits great, provides support, and it my pads actually stay in place:)",1
1,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Horrible, don't waste your money. Does not look anything like the picture",0
3,It fits.  It just goes up your butt cheeks a lot and is made odd.,0
5,Just as described. Very sleek.,1
5,Bought this for my troll costume.  Actually stays on my ears and easy to put on.  Great addition to my costume!,1
5,Color richness,1
4,"It’s beautiful and the quality is great. It does run very small!! I couldn’t even put it on, had to return",1
1,This fits awkwardly. It's made in china. And the listing gives me no return option.,0
2,I love the color but they are to small,0
5,Just what I was want,1
5,I love this dress. Looks very pretty on me.,1
1,No sirve,0
3,"Comfy and real nice, but the pockets are really small and ripped open within two days",0
4,nice color,1
1,"I like the design and size, but this is one heavy purse.  Who can carry this around for a few hours...<br />And the lock was placed crooked.  Unfortunately will be returning it.",0
3,They’re cute but way too tiny. If you have long nails forget about getting them in.,0
4,They are okay.,1
4,Great patch adhesive not so good,1
3,"Oddly enough, the dress is okay. It is something you might find in Ross Dress for Less but what I really love is the BELT! I haven't even worn the dress yet but I have worn the belt plenty of times. Make such a statement.",0
3,"The ""rose gold"" band is not the same color as the watch. Both are difficult to get on but I did like the leather one. Color transfers over really easily though, it was blue by the end of the day, wasn't even wearing blue.",0
4,"The fabric feels good.  The elastic is a little twisted, nothing I  could not fix.  Looks good on!  I am pleased.  It meets my expectations in quality as well. I gave it a 4 rating because I am small chested.  If i was bigger chested it would fill out better.",1
1,The quality was very nice but it ran very small. I ordered my regular size a large and couldn't even try it on it was so tight on my arms.,0
3,"2020 and Covid have canceled all Christmas parties this year so there is no point in dressing up for the holidays.  So, this kfulemai Women's Christmas Graphic T is perfect for Christmas Eve with my immediate family (with whom I reside). I can be ""festive"" while low key and comfortable on Christmas Eve with a pair of leggings.  The material is pretty soft.  I thought that the sleeves were rolled and stitched into that position from the picture, but it's not.  I would have to do it myself.  I just think a stitch would have made it look a bit more fun than just a plain grey t-shirt with a Christmas tree, but it is what it is.  And it's 2020.",0
2,To small and chain strap kept breaking !!!,0
3,Did not run true to size.,0
3,No really true to size. But really cute,0
5,"I have searched for a leather bag for my very tall, very picky husband. This bag is the perfect size, with adjustable/removeable straps, tons of room. It was a Christmas gift, and he loves it!,",1
3,"I wasnt thrilled about the price of this plastic toy, but being a last minute costume, I chose through this company because I could get it the quickest.  With that said, I was very pleased, I recieved it almost 3 days before it said I'd get it.  Be careful though, my son was running and he and another kid collided and it fell on sidewalk.  It popped open on one side and I can not get it back right.  Other then those 2 things, I have nothing bad to say about them.  I would buy again from them.",0
5,Loved it.,1
5,Love Jeter - hope to get an autograph some day,1
4,"A cute casual dress that is easy to wear and care for, and fits true to size. Material is lightweight but not see-through. I'm editing my review to mention this dress fades when washed. I did wash it in a machine on gentle cold water as it does say hand wash. I feel washing by hand is a bit much to do for a dress. If buying a dark color do follow directions.",1
2,Bag is excellent in design but quality control was missed by zipper end twisted so closing zipper were impossible. I had slice threads untwisted then resewed. Didn't to return easy fix.,0
1,Definitely not American sizes. I ordered an XL and it fit like a small. Bummer. I really liked this style.,0
3,It popped after 4 months.. but it’s comfortable.. it fits well..  but lasted only 4 months...,0
5,She wanted red boots for Christmas and she had them on all day lol!!!  Soft inside and they look very cute on.  Not sure how long they will last will update if they fall apart after wearing for a while.,1
5,They fit perfect I love them.,1
3,"A little large, larger than the jay bay. The quality at first seems very good, but when compared to jay bay, it's lacking. Not molded to a conforming shape, rather just a rubber plank",0
1,Cheap materials and broke after 2 uses,0
5,Came super fast,1
5,Love it. A Perfect fit and great fabric.,1
3,"I’ve worn Feetures no-show socks with my running shoes for years and I love them, but this was my 1st pair of Feetures Hidden Socks.  I liked the fact that they are thicker & more absorbent than other footlets that I own, and I also like the fact that they stay in place better. But the elastic edge around the top of these socks is much thicker than my other footlets, so it cuts into my foot where it crosses over my big toe joint and becomes quite painful by the end of the day. This may not be a problem for some people, but in my case I won’t be ordering these again.",0
5,This bag was an amazing purchase. Just let the picture speak for itself. Do not hesitate and buy it!!,1
5,"Love it, fits perfect! I would normally would wear an XL but decided to get XXL just from some reviews I read before purchasing said it ran a littleSmall.",1
3,I love the shirt but it was a size too small. I normally wear a medium but I should have gotten a large in this shirt,0
2,Wasn't a huge fan of the navy color. Looks a bit Amish. Other colors look Fantastic!,0
3,Works but runs small,0
5,"Wow, the material is so soft!  I love this t-shirt and wear it often.  Must rep my Chargers!",1
2,Does not look like a quality mask. Also not sure if it’s really made in Korea.,0
5,I really like these charms. I got them to make protection bracelets for me and my friends. They are really beautiful and there was a lot of variety to chose from.,1
4,"Positives: I've wore this dress about 3 times now and I've been pleased each time. The color is beautiful and rich, the material is like fleece on the inside and polyester on the outside. Its a form fitting dress, can be dressed up or down. Fit me as expected. I'd say the size chart is correct. Dress is flattering, I want more colors! May I suggest a light grey? :)<br />Negatives: Had my nails painted white and this dress changed the color pink. Didnt notice how often my nails brush against my clothes. Also washed a white towel with the dress - my fault - and the towel turned slightly pink so careful with that.Also there is no back tag so you have to figure out on your own which side is the front.",1
4,Shirt runs a little small and the material was not what I expected (kind of a slick material). My husband liked it so I kept it and it looks nice on.,1
1,"Im 5'1 about 160pds dree too long and it is form fitting but i think this dress made for taller women, didnt look good on me<br />Returning it",0
1,Very poor quality. Watch stopped working after a few months and strap broke.,0
1,"I would not have bought the item had I known they couldn’t be returned. The colors I got are terrible. I will look like a child. I thought maybe it would be a good mix but mine are all pretty much the same, and horrid! So disappointed! Waste of money and disappointed in Amazon!",0
5,Good quality shirts that look great at a nice price!,1
5,I am enjoying my bag.,1
2,"I had to return. I have bought cheaper dresses on Amazon with much better quality. It fit fine, so for that I gave it an extra star, but the material is cheap and not at all as described. Don't waste your time or money.",0
4,Cat is a very bad quality you cannot lock adjustment,1
4,"Un artículo hermoso pero legítimamente deslumbrante,únicamente sugiero que no se elabore tan grande,deberia hacerse un poco mas pequeño creo LUCIRIA MEJOR.Este artículo lo compré para mi padre SE QUE LE ENCANTARÁ PUES EL PERTENECE A ESE GRADO MASÓNICO,GRACIAS.",1
4,My daughters teacher loved this gift.,1
5,I have had a lot of eye surgery recently and need glasses which reduce glare for night time driving.  These were suggested by someone else.  They work beautifully. I wear a different pair for daytime driving but found that I could wear these all day if I wish.  The HD anti-glare glasses cut glare from street lights and head lights.  Thanks,1
5,"well made, kid loves it!",1
5,I was very pleasantly surprised!!  The material is beautiful and the fit is perfect. I order another in black!!!,1
3,"They are ok. Look perfect when you wear them for the first time but for some reason get bigger and super loose in the top part. I don’t wear them to the gym with crop tops because it just looks funny. I still wear them around the hous because they’re comfy. I usually wear small and this is the size I ordered, run way too big for me! And no compression either.",0
4,Go up a size,1
4,Very  good for long walk,1
2,Very flimsy,0
5,"A little tough getting on due the the compression, but all in all a great sock",1
1,"Took it out of the bag, undid the snap to adjust size: it broke off. Not much more to say.",0
5,Fit just the way I like. So comfy I could sleep in them.,1
5,I love this shirt. I would order it again in another color.,1
5,Nice looking belt. Very easy to cut and adjust the length. I cut mine so the buckle was right in the middle of the section for the ratchet function. I bought two because they were a good bargain.<br />Would recommend.,1
5,"YES, YES, YES!!  I finally found what I wanted, nylon braided cords with a long enough length. Now I can still use my phone while its plunged into the outlet, and I don't have to worry about damaging the cords. Arrived as expected, and I will be ordering from your site again.",1
1,My almost 6 year old wanted these so bad so I decided to try these. They were so big and heavy he could hardy walk let alone use the wheels! He took them off after 10 mins and said he didn’t want them anymore.,0
5,love them,1
3,"The straps frayed and fell apart really quickly.  I bought another pair for my son forms vans directly ... SAME thing. Very disappointed with the brand for their poor quality in toddler shoes. None of the vans shoes that me and my boyfriend own have been so poorly made.<br />Other than the fraying straps and too quick to wear down toe top of the shoe, they look awesome and fit well and my son could walk and run really well in them.",0
3,"First it came in late had to get a replacement sent and the emblem is off center, wasn't happy with it.",0
3,"This sweatshirt is ok.  I have a long torso so its a bit short for my liking.  Its also a bit baggy or wide in the arms and torso area, not slim like in the picture.  I like my sweatshirts to have a little extra length in the arms too and this sweatshirt does not.  I dont think I would buy another.",0
3,"WAY too small.  My daughter usually wears a 1.5 -2... she couldn't even get these on.  Other than that,  they were nice.",0
3,There ok. Not exactly a great deal but better than dollar store glasses,0
5,I use these for metal detecting tethering my pinpointer. Does a great job.,1
4,As described.,1
5,"These sunglasses are so beautiful! I needed the wrap around to wear over my glasses but, oh. the joy to find PURPLE! I love these sunglasses!",1
4,I just received it and haven't changed purses yet.  It looks like it is going to work for me and I love the way it looks.,1
4,"I do really like this necklace. It's not as ""rose gold"" as the pictures and the chain is okay but not great. If you accidentally snag this on something it's going to snap. Other than that it's a good find. (Also, the chain length is more of a child size.)",1
5,"it gave what it be as suppose to give , it was stretchy fit like a glove , I got a lot of compliments wearing this outfit 🥰❤️ ORDER IT NOWWW",1
1,They were very small,0
1,"Cheap materials, stones gas fallen out in the box.",0
1,Very disappointed. It was advertised as an XL. But was actually an ES.,0
3,"The fabric is thinner than id thought. The colors are also brighter than in the picture-- more vibrant/bright than the jewel toned rich colors they had appeared to me in the pics above. Is as long as id thought tho-- im 115 lbs 5'4"" and Small hits right above my ankles.",0
1,Fabric was cheap and terrible and broke almost instantly. It fits great hut I'm a 36DD and it didnt fit my breast area at all...I got an XL and the larger wouldn't fit well and would be to baggy.,0
5,These are really comfortable and also fit great. The price is reasonable as well you can't  go wrong with these.,1
5,"My 3-year old loves these and can't get enough.  She wakes up every day wanting a new pair of earrings.  These look cute, stick on and stay on, and peel off easily.  Absolutely worth it.",1
5,Super soft and easy to care for. It looks just like the pictures and the fit is great.,1
5,Feels very tough and durable. Nice and slim I have 10 cards and about 5 bills. I am currently using the money clip option. This is my second wallet from this company. Highly recommend!,1
1,Very cheap material!! Made poorly! Very poor quality,0
5,Very Sparkly.  Made well.,1
5,very nice,1
3,nice but broke in a month,0
1,I don't have a clue how it fit because I received a shiny gold tank top? Didn't even take out of the bag and just sent back.,0
5,I love this dress!,1
4,"These shorts were exactly what I wanted the price (as usual for me) was a bit high, but the quality seems to be there. The only issue for me is the color green it's a bit brighter than I'm use to so I will have to be careful matching my tshirts. First world problems.",1
5,Great socks!,1
5,"Lovely, handmade treasure.",1
5,Great quality.,1
5,I'm kind of on the short side so this skirt is a little long for me but thankfully I know how to sew and so can hem it. It fits great besides that and I can't wait to wear it for my performance!!,1
4,fit well true to size,1
1,Did not match the rose gold of my watch,0
5,This was purchased for a trip to Florida. I like that it’s light weight and can be stored in its own pocket. It seemed to protect my skin from the sun when I didn’t reapply my sunscreen. It also works well when your kind of chilly in the summer. It’s very lightweight. The fit was great too.,1
3,Packaged great but stretched out,0
2,"This review is for the Halter Neck Pleated Front (backless) top. The material is thin (although soft) and the back is lower than a normal bra line (so even if you wanted to wear strapless, good luck). The drape in front is fine, but it's super tight. I bought an XL and it fit like a M—showed everything I was trying to conceal. Try the V-neck wrap-front halter tank instead. It's actually really flattering even with the elastic at the bottom, and it's true to size. The material smells terrible, and mine came with some frayed stitching, but those are minor complaints.",0
2,Not enough protection,0
2,didn't not fit well and wasn't easy to get into boot to wear. :(,0
1,Looks like childrens’ jewelry. Disappointed based on other reviewers. Good for teenagers and children due to low luster and stiffness of chain.,0
1,It came with a hole in the crotch,0
5,Muy bonita,1
3,"I was looking for a racer-back tank that also offered a higher neckline to cover my chest from sun exposure when working/exercising outside. This tank fits the bill. The fabric is very stretchy and billowy in the wind though, clinging to and highlighting any curves below that you had hoped the looser fit would conceal.",0
5,"I got them for my husband to wear now, but he said they were to hot, so now i don't have to buy him any for the winter, I have been looking for a nice comfort pair for the summer, however he really like the slippers, I will be getting him more in the near future.",1
1,The teal is not teal at all. More of a hunter green,0
2,"When I finally got it, it looked like a girls outfit. Not a boys",0
5,"Originally I was planning to get it as ball stretcher but after reading a review from a customer who also got this product as a cocking , I decide to get the larger one to wear as cock ring. It definitely a nice weight stretching out the balls and penis together. Not sure you can wear it out because it’s big and noticeable even under sweatpants.",1
1,Cheap materials and does NOT look like the pictures. The chest part is only about 2-3 inches wide and the mid section is less than 2. As you can see it’s not even as wide as an AirPod case. Slightly disappointed & may return.,0
1,Wanted to wear on my cruise but couldn’t because it was too exact!!!,0
2,"The shirt fit fine it'self, but the material felt sorta cheap and the decal is at an odd place in my opinion and not on the chest as shown.",0
2,The lenses lasted like 2 months. They started to peel off on the boarders.,0
5,Perfect!! I was worried cause some of the reviews weren't very good but is was exactly what i hoped for. The material is a thin lycra so I would advice using a bra under it. I am very happy with it. I'm 5'6&#34; and 132lbs and ordered size 4/6.,1
5,"Soft, comfy, ease to put on",1
5,Love love love the shirt- I have only worn it once so far but I got 4 compliments on the shirt that day!,1
5,I thought this sweater was really nice and very stylish.,1
2,fits too tightly and is too long for my body type. (I did order a size larger than I am and it's still too tight.),0
5,"Cute for everyday, but can be dressed up with a belt and boots",1
3,Cute shirt,0
5,"I ordered two different leather bracelets from this seller and I love them both.  The picture doesn't show too clearly how the underside slides along two ties to make a larger and smaller fit.  What that means is that, unless you have 10"" wrists,  there's a two tails that you tuck under the main part of the bracelet.  My wrists are actually pretty thin, so I retied the ends so that it would fit tighter.  I also trimmed off the extra tie, that didn't need to be so long.  Really cute casual rocker style.",1
3,"This top was alright but not what was represented in the picture. I ordered the lavender block shirt and the one the model is wearing has the lavender down part of the right sleeve. The one I received had a completely black sleeve. It wasn't nearly as attractive as the shirt in the picture. Also, the white triangle of material on the bottom made the shirt appear cheap in person.  I returned it.",0
3,Material un poco rústico,0
5,"I ordered a large,it is tight on me in the thigh area,but I received a lot of compliments..",1
5,Overall good pair of leggings.  Fit great.  Great material. Comfy.,1
5,"Very comfortable material, multiple colors and easy to put on and remove masks. I have used others similar but this brand and material is superb compared to others. Highly recommended!",1
2,"Very large in heel area. These are very nice shoes, arch support is evident as soon as you slip them on. I am a size 11 shoe, average width feet and these slip right off  in heel area when I attempt to walk. Sorry to say I am returning.",0
1,"Very disappointed,  I ordered a large and it fits my wife like an extra-small , short jacket.<br />They know their sizes run small so common sense is to make XXXL and XXXXL sizes? ????????<br />The shoulder are made narrow, the sleeves were very tight, and dress is really short-tight jacket.  So if you are over 5' and over 100 lbs do not or do from this company.",0
1,Poorly constructed. Low quality materials. Looks nothing like it did in the photographs,0
1,Sent these back because they were a little too big and the design wasn’t as cute as in person.,0
1,If I could have not marked a star I wouldn't have. This was absolute garbage! The sizing was rediculious. 5xl could fit a 10 yr old. It was so cheap..it looked like a 5 yr old made it! This seller should be ashamed to have their name on this product!  Don't waste your time...you will have to go through the hassle of returning it!!!!!!!!,0
5,This cardigan is made with acrylic yarn.<br />It’s not a soft acrylic. I wish it was.<br />But it is the type of acrylic that holds it shape.<br />I’m very happy with the color of this cardigan.<br />I now really want to buy a silky cami/tank top in a similar matching color to wear underneath for a monotone type look.<br />The brown is bright and warm.,1
4,"Great quality. I'm not crazy about the sheen to it, although it's not that bad. Fits my 4 year old with slight room to grow.",1
1,Boots are worn out after only a few months of wear.,0
2,Todavía no me ha llegado y por esta razón no puedo operar,0
3,"I ordered this to go with my Fossil Unisex 44MM Gen 5 Carlyle HR- and yes, it fits and it looks good.<br />My negative is that I didn't read the fine print, and realize that its not a true chain band.<br />It is just that stretchy elastic that comes in bracelet making kits, that is holding the beads and ""metal"" -looking- pcs of the 'chain' together.  I did purchase it thinking it was a true chain band- so I'm a little disappointed with that, but after re-reading the description  I do see that it does say 'elastic' - so just make sure you know that when purchasing.  Price is ok for a plastic and elastic band- and it does look really nice.  I'll have to see how it holds up long term- but I won't expect durability.  I'm a little nervous that it will break at the wrong time and I'll lose the watch itself (the most important part).  So, maybe not something to be worn for daily use.<br />Also note-<br />The rings around each bead are plastic as well- not metal.  The only thing that is metal on this  band are the pins to attach to the watch, the 'rings' that attach the bands to the clasp (I don't even think the clasp is metal)  Not even that dangly chain at the end that adjusts the size... that seems to be plastic as well.  At least, I  couldn't get a magnet to attract to anything but the 3 small jump rings.",0
3,es muy pequeño y no tiene aretes..!!,0
5,Fits and drapes beautifully!,1
3,"I love this scarf/hood, the only down fall is that it sheds tremendously. It is very warm and soft and plush ... it just sheds. After a day of wearing it it looks like I had a chunk of cat or dog hair blow up on me!",0
3,The material is supper cheep and see though in the sunlight.  I gave it 3 stars though because it looks exactly like the picture and I ended up wearing it to a dark bar were no one could see though it.,0
3,The color is nice the material is nice it’s just too snug and I like them to be loose fitting. I’ve ordered the size and other brands but this particular size was too small but I’m still going to make it work,0
4,I little higher on the waist than I like.,1
1,The same thing with this shirt I bragged on it before receiving it and was disappointed when it arrived I could not get an arm in this shirt. I want to have this shirt if it is made in bigger sizes please send me the pink colored one if you have it in bigger sizes.,0
1,"I did not like that they were very small.  Some would only fit a child, much less someone with long hair.",0
2,Most of them are good. However the pair I was looking forward to the most (amethyst) are totally different colors and are larger than the rest of the pairs,0
5,Not top quality but will be a great once in awhile for a different look,1
4,the belt looks stylish .,1
1,It broke within one day of wearing it,0
5,I have 7 of these I wear them so often. Sooo cute under clothes or alone as a bikini top!,1
4,"These are very fun rain boots, that make me smile when I wear them on a rainy day, received a lot of complaints when I wear them.",1
1,Very poorly made. Grommets fell off with 1 washing. I also ordered another style of these pants and they arrived with a huge hole in the inseam.,0
1,Looks cheap and super ugly in person,0
2,I ordered this dress for my granddaughters one in the light blue the other in the navy.  The flowers on the navy are dull and not as pictured.  The girls wear the same size and the darker colored dress was 2 sizes larger in the same size than the lighter one.  I would not purchase again.,0
5,I love these pants so much that I have them in two colors. The fit is true to size and can be dressed up with a blouse for work or worn with a crop top and heels for a night on the town! The pants are a perfect length - can be worn with heels or flats.,1
5,Purchased these for my mother who has a shoulder injury. They were perfect!! She loved the material and quality seems great as we have washed it several times and no signs of fading.,1
3,I’ve bought multiple pair of these in a lot of colors but for reason the black ones NEVER come the right size. I bought them once in a small and they looked like children leggings I couldn’t even believe what I bought LOL. The second time I bought a medium and they were still relatively small but the stretch helped. The black ones just do not feel or fit the same as other colors I’ve ordered.,0
2,Not a product flaw but these were too big and heavy for me.,0
5,"Fit beautiful, I got it for my daughter she’s 4”11 and 118lb a size small fit her great! Just at  knee length , I hope this information helps 😊",1
4,"Floaty, drapery, light and airy just for that extra layer to dress up a maxi. Not heavy.",1
5,They’re just cute. Not supposed to be functional or warm.,1
5,"Runs a little big, but overall really great outfit. Looks exactly like the photo, except the headband comes untied (perfect in my opinion). Pants are very long so keep that in mind for short kiddos. But I do love this so much!",1
5,"I’m in love with this coat! It’s so soft and it fits great! It’s super light weight, but it still keeps me warm which is amazing! I would 100% buy it again",1
5,Roomy and Roomy!!,1
5,BIG HIT for my daughter. She's 12 and really liked this gift. Each pair of earrings were individually wrapped and all came in a cute gift box that was so appealing that I didn't even wrap it. They seem to be good quality - not flimsy at all.,1
3,They are much bigger than I was thinking.,0
1,"Super cheap necklace that looks nothing like pictured on Amazon.<br />Much smaller pendant than it appears on Amazon - smaller then the circumference of a dime<br />Made of like tin metal - pressed/stamped metal<br />Basically, it's the quality of something you'd get from a gumball machine<br />DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS! You'll be disappointed.",0
5,Just as described,1
3,"Pretty print and runs true to size. However, if you have any chest, this style may not work for you. I’m 5’2” and 105 lbs with 32DD chest. My boobs were spilling out!!",0
3,"The purse was beautiful,well made I returned it because it was to large.",0
2,The top fit me (34B) but the bottom/skirt is too short. I'm 5' 3'' and it was about 2'' above my ankles. I usually wear a 2/small and I ordered a small. I returned the dress bc it was too short for my liking.,0
1,Not true to size,0
3,This is not a dress. I am 5’8” and the item would work better with leggings.,0
5,Wear it everyday. Good gold tone for dark skin.,1
5,Buttery soft and incredibly comfy. Love them!,1
3,Really hard to get on my daughters foot runs a bit small,0
5,Fantastic!,1
5,This product is used outside daily.,1
5,They are both my countries and I have dual citizenship.,1
5,My husband loves. We bought another.,1
3,"I like the look & feel of these gloves, however, they are not near warm enough for ND winters. Better than my other gloves, but I had to warm up after 2 mins of shoveling snow. Would probably be great somewhere with mild winters.",0
2,Was more peach than pink. Sending it back.,0
5,Bought for my best friend for Christmas. We both wear them and can be worn 24/7 without tangling. Cleans up nice too.,1
5,"I have owned these watches for many years and they never fail me until the battery goes dead.  It cost more to replace the battery than the price of the watch, so I always end up buying a new one and they last for years.  No mater what abuse I give them, they always hold up well.",1
5,Awesome,1
5,Simplemente el mejor.,1
1,The item was very cheap looking and not made very well.  It doesn’t look like the same as in the picture.,0
1,"Bought these sock due to high stars and price.  When I received them I was disappointed in the quality, fit, and material.<br />The fabric was very cheap and no support.  I purchased a the XXL for shoe size 11 to 15, i wear a 13 and the sock was very difficult to put on and just didn't fit right.",0
5,Good pair of shoes. They look sharp and seem to breathe well.,1
5,Gave as gift to fellow nurse who loves it and gets lot compliments love that it has padding for for head and pull ties to adjust . Matches with our Ciel Blue mandatory uniforms,1
2,"got xl, arrived pretty much as a small. cute design but i would return if it wasnt such a hassle",0
2,"I bought these shorts for my daughter who is dancer. She has wore them maybe 1x week for a few hours at a time. I wash all of her dancewear on delicate and hang to dry. After 4 months, the shorts are pilled *everywhere*.  She has a variety of brands of shorts--Lululemon, Balera, etc., and no other brand does this.  I do not recommend.",0
4,"It takes forever to get it. Typo you get items in a day or two, with this shirt you have to wait 2 weeks. It’s a good quality shirt but it does run large. I’m 5’7” and weight around 200 and it looks kinda big on me. I’m not returning it, I’m still going to wear it around the house and on my walks, but considering ordering another one in small or medium for when I lose some weight.",1
3,Not easy to put on. Very snug fit. Colors are beautiful.,0
2,So I took this bag with me while backpacking around Ireland as a way to hold my dirty laundry untill I could make it home. The bag fell apart after about 10 days of use. Bad construction was definitely a factor. I also might have been putting to much weight. Would not recommend for traveling.,0
3,This slip one fit great.  They grip the floor nicely.  Biggest complaint is that they do not drain.  There are two holes in the soles for drainage but the water pools and stays.,0
5,great comfortable band.,1
4,"This is a very gorgeous product, it does leave marks on your hand after long periods of time, because of what it’s made out of it’ll stain your skin but that’s easily fixable, just put a top coat of clear nail polish over it and your golden otherwise, it’s amazing",1
3,Order a size up.,0
4,The skirt is fine but very long<br />I had to cut and then sewn a hem,1
3,"Nice charm, horrible chain",0
4,"I like it. It's comfy. But it's hard to keep wrinkle free. The quality is a little below average. It's plain to see it was put together as fast as possible. That said, I still like it.",1
3,"The pockets are very thin, my keys punched a hole in them",0
5,The color is beautiful.  Plenty of room for cards and money. Great quality,1
5,Great,1
5,So cute! great quality.,1
2,"looked like they might not actually be vans, but can't be sure. They ran very big! Will save them for him to grow into as it is often more difficult to return products",0
2,These are BRIGHT RED like Rudolph's nose.  My 2nd attempt with this seller.  Neither purchase was described or pictured color.,0
1,This is a COUNTERFEIT/UNLICENSED/PIRATED product!  I'm fairly certain it is illegal to sell this in the USA.,0
5,Best boots I’ve ever had.,1
3,My son loved them as part of his baseball uniform,0
5,SO dang cute! I ordered mine a tad big on purpose so it was loose and comfy. I get compliments every time I wear this shirt.,1
5,"Added a bottle of wine, had Hotel staff put it in my son's room on their wedding night!!",1
3,Loved this and wore it a couple times. Then washed it and it shrunk and now I’m sad,0
1,Looks very cheap.,0
1,"Runs small, not true to size. Made very well and fabric is nice. Just too small.",0
3,I am 5'2 and about 100 lbs. I normally wear a 32D but I mistakenly ordered a 32C so it didn't fit. If I had gotten the 32D it probably would've fit.,0
5,Nice,1
5,Lots of room for carrying personal items. A small laptop/ipad will fit in this purse. Well made.,1
5,👍🏽,1
4,"I bought this for a DragonCon costume, mostly because the price was right. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the belt when it arrived, however. And the ratcheting mechanism is very cool. I'll have to see how it hold up at Con before rendering a final judgement, but so far, this is significantly better than I was expecting. And if it works out well, I plan on getting at least one more (black) for every day use.",1
5,"Really pretty lava stone beaded necklace...gorgeous detailing in which each bead has a knot tied behind and in front of it. There are silver beads as accent beads, 5 in all, and there is a beautiful silken red tassel at the end of the necklace. It looks like it has been handmade and it is very well done. It is long and the thread or cording it is strung on is not stretchy or elasticized at all. So, this is not your typical mala you would normally order from the internet. This is exactly what I have been in search of for quite some time. I wish they had one that was plain with sandalwood beads and no accent beads at all. I would order that in a heartbeat. I am quite pleased with this mala necklace/bracelet and would most definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful piece to add to their collection of jewelry. I collect malas or prayer beads and these are fantastic. When you wrap it around your wrist you can wrap 5 to 6 times and still get it over your hand. Worn around your neck, it hangs like a sweater necklace. The red pendant almost to your belly button....LOL! I think it is very beautiful and simple in its design.<br />I received this mala at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review of the product. I hope you have found my review helpful. Thank you!",1
5,Super cute comfortable lil snug for a large but its stretchy so still looks great im 5'4 158 i love these pants,1
1,Gave me a rash,0
5,i love the classic look of the casio and having the different color options was very cool choosed this grey tone color because i already own a few of the common colors,1
1,Too big,0
2,"I bought two of these for 2 heavy weight wool scarves that are so heavy you can’t tie or loop them in Any Way.  These clasps are so heavy and clumsy that I doubt I will ever use them.  Wish I still had the packaging to return them.  Designed in Spain, Based in America, Made in China…that sounds like a run around.",0
4,Exactly what I was expecting.,1
1,It's a dupe of the photo. Absolutely horrendous,0
3,Return size not right for my needs.,0
5,this worked great in the garden this year. kept me cool. I was amazed,1
5,"I needed something to keep my pins from getting yanked off of my lanyard at school. I'm a teacher and my students enjoy checking out my new pins so I needed an effective solution to keeping them secure. These pin locks are perfect, easy to use, and you get plenty of them for the price.",1
4,somewhat cheaply made but it served its purpose for a party,1
1,Not Worth.....,0
2,"I do not like the turtleneck, it is very loose.  I was hoping for a snug fit.",0
5,Tons of comments on these already. Love them.,1
4,Too large,1
1,I have worn this for less than 2 weeks and it is already tarnishing/turned black in some areas. There is no way this belly button ring is actually decently &#34;gold-plated.&#34; Very Disappointed.,0
5,"I love this jacket. I do wish the inner neck piece could be removed, but I do still like it",1
1,These were tissue thin and did not fit according to size.  Poorly made and returned them immediately once I opened the package,0
1,The description should include that someone should size up to get the appropriate fit. A more accurate description would say that this is an poor quality vinyl ironed on a poor quality shirt. Size up 1 to 2 sizes for accurate fit. Hand wash and line dry only.,0
3,"Great everyday bag! Perfect size, lovely color! I've been using it for a few days, and my only issue is it smells funky. Kind of a chemical-fishy smell. The odor wasn't noticeable at first, but it's gotten worse, and is transferring to my hands now. Maybe it's just the blue, as I haven't read any other reviews noting the odor. I'm going to try stuffing it with mesh bags fillled with activated charcoal to see if it can be mitigated.",0
5,Used for my keys gave one to my sister and one to my mom they loved them,1
5,My 2 1/2 year old son has eczema and we needed some breathable cotton socks to wear with his summer shoes...these are perfect! And great price. We ordered size S and he wears a size 8 toddler shoe,1
3,These socks are ribbed. The image spreads when they are worn.,0
3,"The idea is a good one. Maybe instead of using velcro a button with different slots would work better. Also, the velcro trim is very hard so that is the scratching culprit. I tried folding it so my LO wouldn't be scratched but because it's so short she still got it off.",0
2,Nice color. Extremely see through. Picture does not show hope revealing chest area is. Huge opening under the tie. Not been for women with D chest.,0
1,The seam on the back sleeve opened after wearing it gently twice only / bad quality,0
3,Cute and trendy. Took forever to arrive which was annoying.,0
5,Perfect fit!! Love the colors.,1
1,Poor quality and shrinks bad...,0
5,"Love these boxers , part baby rib , part brief styling - all awesome !",1
5,"It is pretty, I like it it just took a little while to get it.",1
1,Bra cup size was way too big but rest of suit was acceptable sizing,0
1,Not a good quality shoe,0
5,I got a large and they fit perfect. I wear these under my scrubs. They are awesome. I work at an assisted living and it’s always hot in there so I am literally always sweating and these absorb the moisture and are just genuinely comfortable.,1
5,"Excelente inversión. Se ven muy bien, tienen muy buena calidad, y su precio esta excelente.",1
5,"I love my silver bracelets! I bought four different styles from Amberta, and they look great together. I’m considering buying some of their other styles now also. Great quality for such a low price!",1
4,"I like it, it's great and so much easier than a normal belt, especially for skinny guys who can never find the right belt loop to keep pants up. Only downside as mentioned is some of the wear on the leather front the ratchet rubbing. However, for the price point I think it's worth it. If it gets worse I'll contact the company who seems to be responsive on these things. Overall happy.",1
2,"Dress shown in the photo appears to be knee length. I’m 5’ 6” Actual dress length is almost to my ankles.  Far longer than anticipated, fit well every where else.",0
5,Perfect for day or evening wear.,1
5,👌🏻,1
5,"muy bonita y me encanta , llego a tiempo y en corto tiempo de espera, es hermosa",1
1,Very disappointed . Lasted one winter,0
5,"Purchased the wrap for my wife to wear at the pool. It is perfect for that, but also to wear as a sun dress for outside get togethers.",1
5,This item worked great with my test prep.  Found it very useful since you cant really see the classroom clock  if you are sitting far away from it while taking the LSAT.,1
5,Beautiful bracelet,1
4,"Next time I'd go a size bigger, fit is ok",1
1,Used for two trips and the plastic tab for holding the adjustments broke off of two of them.  Bought two and it happened to both so I wasn’t just that I got a bad one.,0
2,"At the time I purchased these, there were no other reviews so I was hesitant to purchase. However, I did buy because of other thongs I have purchased from the same seller/same brand and they were exactly what I was looking for; a thong with just the elastic band around the waist and a very small string. I am a 30-31 inch waist and will usually wear a US small but I ordered these in the large, tag size XL. The waist was fine but the pouch is TINY! I am not large by any means but I honestly could not fit the entire package in the pouch. It was just way too small and caused way too much &#34;overflow&#34;. Besides the fit, great fabric and I think they would have been comfortable. Plus, the seller has some other great thongs out there.",0
5,"My cool hooded sweatshirt is so comfy,and warmed..wore it yesterday and i loved it..no need for another sweater well atleast here in cali coz no snow here..so this sweatshirt is just perfect..love the design really cute and unique im not small size but getting the right size is absolutely perfect and makes you slim..would highly recommend this hooded sweatshirt so cool",1
5,Used these for the first time traveling. They were great in keeping things organized and in place!,1
2,"Too big for a woman.  Very heavy. Very difficult to take out links.  Looks pretty, but really suited for a man not a woman.",0
5,Ears are great clipped to headband. My daughters favorite just to dress up around house. Must have for any fox lover!,1
5,I work in a very old building and it gets cold.  These gloves were perfect to warm up my hands yet let me keep working.  Lightweight material but comfy.  Nice neutral color I could wear anytime.,1
2,broke after two weeks,0
3,I like this a lot but the zipper snags when i have the phone in it which is kinda dangerous.,0
1,Poor quality for price,0
5,Great item,1
1,Way too big for my face.  Returning,0
5,Bought this for my pandora bracelet when I graduated from nursing school. Prefect fit.,1
4,I am returning this dress it is not the size I need. I read all the reviews and the dress I received was very small.,1
5,this purse is great! good size lots of secure pockets nice amount of room,1
3,"Even though this was for a child, the material is see-through and light. I wouldn't have my daughter wear this out.",0
3,Smaller than expected,0
3,Would have giveb it full five stars.. its larger than expected.. almost like a long chain which usually one wears with a maxi dress. I had not read the description. I thought would be small as a pendant. But its very prettty,0
1,This material is very odd. To me it feels like some kind of rubber. It’s not cotton. Very cheap. There is no way I would wear this kind of material. Especially in the heat of summer. I returned it.,0
3,"Absorbs, but there is side leakage.",0
5,"Bueno, para mis raquetes qiuedo muy bien,",1
5,Love these socks! I got the 2t/3t so they would fit longer. They’re super cute and seem to be made well.,1
5,Really cute fit,1
3,Did an OK job,0
3,Very small and comes with extra backs. Nothing fancy or anything really. But works,0
5,"I bought this for my wife to use at the gym, it’s a nice bag, wish it was a little bit bigger but it gets the job done. Has extra pockets inside for the cell phoneAnd car keys. The side bag she uses to store her sweaty clothes.",1
5,great soft leather belt for a great price .,1
3,I like that this purse has a flap to close. I also Ike that it isn't huge.,0
5,These are now the most comfortable pair of shorts I own! I ended up purchasing two other colors after.. Good material and quality.<br /><br />Most shorts I buy ride up in the crotch area but these are perfect!,1
2,"The guidance on this item is to order one size larger than your usual. I did and my guess is my regular size would have been too small, but what I got was too large, and just seemed like an odd cut regardless of size. More importantly, the fabric feel is super synthetic. If you like that sort of thing, you will love these pants. Not for me.",0
3,I like the look and style. However after one use the band wholes strayed to rip. After 3-4 wear the band.....it looks like I have worn the watch for years . It appears that it’s a cheap bank quality. It dosent appear thatbit will last very long before looking to wore out to wear. Bummer,0
5,Very pretty! This scarf is soft and really roomy. It can be worn in so many different ways (do an online 'how-to' search and you'll see tons of ways to wear it). I prefer the lighter areas but the dark makes a contrast. No complaints here. This makes for a really nice present.,1
5,"I would like to rate this, IF IT WOULD ARRIVE! Ordered Nov 29, today is Dec 7th, I pay a prime membership fee, this is a qualified purchase. What’s up Amazon??<br /><br />I selected 5 ⭐️ to not hurt the vendor only!",1
1,"Was like a nightgown, so thin!<br />Very  cheap Looking!",0
2,"These are very very comfortable. However, they are cut too small in the butt and they rip if I move too quickly. I ordered a size larger than I usually wear because of what some other reviews said. Unfortunately that was not enough.",0
5,"Top is nice and loose, bottoms are fitted. Nice thick material",1
1,What a joke!! Don’t believe the other reviews!! Super uncomfortable!! Super weird fit!! And it is not a one size fits all!!,0
3,"I ordered this dress in XL, but it is way too small. Runs like M. It is see through too (white with aqua design). Will return it. This dress is well made and a good quality fabric.",0
4,Studs fit nice hoops just a little hard to open,1
4,The fit is great.,1
5,Great looking sturdy belt.,1
3,"I purchased a medium and I am usually a med (8 in pants) in anything. Let’s start with the chest part. I can tell you as a DD this part is very large I need to take it in and it is very short and I am 5’5” even with a petticoat I still have to wear biker shorts. It fits me like a swim dress!! To tell you the truth I think this was made for the bed room and not a party....well unless you’re going to the playboy mansion. O_O  the waist was fine if I would have went smaller I think the chest would have fit me fine, but I am not sure the waist would have fit me. Plus it may have fit me as a shirt instead lol",0
3,"Logo pieces keep the temples (ear stems) straight, but fall out all the time and are easily lost. Loved the glasses and fit before I lost the logos… pls fix and these will be a great value brand sun glass.<br /><br />Either make them stay in better or don’t have. If they’re meant to pop out for people with big heads, be up front and instruct to glue in or something…",0
1,"I was very excited to have these. However, it would not work after 2 days. It actually fel on the third day and it worked better then. This one is very temperamental as it will work fine for one day then won’t work again for two days,then will work again. Cheaply made as the speaker section was so flimsy you could squeeze the whole thing together",0
5,"Good for the price.  I use for gym shower.  Decent pair of flip flops at a cheap price point.  I noticed some of the reviews complaining about a strong plastic smell, but have to say, I really didn't notice anything too offensive.  Good product, no complaints.",1
3,Three bonnets for a low price is unbeatable. Over time the headband does stretch out and the bonnets slide up but nothing a few stitches my sewing machine can't fix. I wish for more colors.,0
5,Perfect for what we needed. Quick shipping,1
3,"Nice hat for the money, wish dragon was embroidered though (would have paid more)",0
5,Bright colorful & fun. Comfortable because of the individual toes.,1
5,"This is the best wallet I have ever bought, great quality and fits very good in my pockets.",1
5,"These shirts are not wide enough in the neck to expose a shoulder, but they are so cute on top of a tank top",1
5,Love them,1
3,All masks are not the same size. Also they are definitely not very stretchy. They are a snug fit which I didn’t like. They are stitched at edge which was ok but not hemmed. Material very thin. Material is soft. Designs looked good.,0
2,I do like the fabric it’s very soft and tummy control is amazing! It didn’t roll down or anything. When I got them well as you see on the pictures it was already coming apart. I probably won’t buy them again due to the issues I had from buying them for the first time. It is true to its size that’s a plus!,0
5,"I gave this bracelet to my sister for her 68th birthday.  She loves it as well as her 2-1/2 year old granddaughter.  The granddaughter insists that grandmom wears it every time she comes to visit.  My sister gets lots of compliments at church on its sparkle.  Luckily, it has the expansion chain so it can be enlarged for bigger wrists.  Swarovski crystals always have lots of sparkle.",1

2,The zippers keep getting stuck,0
5,Shoes are great they fit perfect and my grandson loved his gift,1
5,"Bought this item for a co worker/dear friend, She loved the necklace as well as the saying that was on the card that it came with. Shipping was fast and the price was awesome. This is an item I would highly recommend to anyone looking for that little gift for a friend just to show how much they mean to.",1
5,"Nice looking shirt. Thin, so my husband won't sweat too much when wearing it. Looks good with a back tuxedo.",1
3,Can you please make an XL or XXL in the black one? I would give you 5 stars if you can this possible. I love this top but the large doesn't fit at all. Thank you!,0
5,"Span the 'buying clothing on Amazon' roulette wheel, with no clue as to whether what would turn up would be genuine or a fake. It tends to be a 50 / 50 chance these days, but the genuine article arrived. Bought it in a rush, at the very last minute before a trip abroad, and pinned all my hopes on it being a nicely structured, warmish, waterproof jacket perfect for unpredictable weather. It was. Fits really nicely, without being too slim fit for my slightly misshapen middle aged body. Online measurements matched up with what arrived, and it's a good deal more stylish and structured than the images suggest, and perhaps from what you'd expect from a soft shell coat. Probably not suitable for winter, but perfect for a chilly Spring trip with a load of wind, and occasional driving, horizontal rain. Repelled the water without a problem. No leaks on any seams. Cut out the wind. It breathes too, so it doesn't turn into a condensation soaked greenhouse. Decent pockets on the outside. None inside. Light for luggage, and can't think of a bad thing to say about it. For a last minute buy, it came up trumps.",1
5,Beautiful chain! Came super fast and packaged perfectly - will buy again.,1
3,"I got this for my daughter and she loved it.  It fit her perfect but on the first day of her wearing it at the lake, the shoe came off and we lost a shoe.<br />Just be aware that it comes off really easily.",0
5,This is a really great watch because it's so cheap but lasts really long. I love this watch but it's finally starting to die so I'm going to get another. This watch is actually really durable I drop it sometimes when I take it off but it's still good. You should get this style of watch if you are looking.,1
2,Unfortunately we received Gold crown not silver and. It’s needed April 21 for senior prom. The crown is beautiful just wrong color.,0
5,"I love how I can choose how long or short I want this skirt!!! I feel so cute/sexy in it, and the material is very comfortable!",1
1,The fabric was super yucky. Hated,0
5,Fit as expected,1
5,This watch is very elegant and beautiful. It goes with anything you wear and it fits quite nicely. I would definitely recommend this watch to any individual who is searching for an affordable timepiece that is somewhat expensive looking. The timing is actually accurate and the watch is easy to set. It arrived on time without any damage whatsoever. All in all this is a lovely timepiece.,1
5,I love the idem,1
5,This is an absolutely beautiful dress. I got so many compliments.  I am 5' 8&#34; about 138 lbs. I normally wear a medium but was not sure so I bought the large. I could have gotten by with the medium but the large fits great. It goes well with both a black or red belt. I highly recommend it.,1
5,"Beautifully made bracelet, excellent quality.",1
1,"They are great while they last, but they only last for 1-2 months.  Save your money and buy anything else.<br />I ordered several packs of these and over half of them are gone shortly thereafter...bottoms wear out or toes poking through.",0
5,I love it. Looks just like the pictures and very comfy. I seen a few reviews saying size up & since I usually go between small and medium depending on the brand (for bottoms) I got a medium. Could’ve done a small though because the tights are too big and don’t fit as nice. Going to see if I can exchange for smaller bottoms.,1
1,Let me start off with. I always buy skydeer gloves. I love the feel. These keep my hands warm. But I purchased this pair of gloves and used them lightly and the threads came apart on 2nd time I used them. I need another pair. Thank you,0
5,Super cute,1
3,I have a 3 1/2 and a 5 1/2 year old and these barely fit the 3 1/2 year old. This fits more like 2-4 years old not 3-7 as indicated.,0
3,"The material was nice, but these were at least a size too big and very wide. I sent them back, rubbed against my ankles too hard.",0
1,They are too obvious.,0
3,"I ordered a medium, I'm 5'8 and 145lbs. The shirt fit great everywhere but the sleeve length as they were to short. It will not stop me from wearing it though. The color is a vibrant emerald and the shirt is well made.",0
1,Didn’t fit,0
1,TOO SMALL AND I WEAR A LARGE AND ORDERED AN X-LARGE AND IT FIT LIKE A MEDIUM,0
5,Love the hat it fits wonderful.,1
3,Material feels cheap but OK. Love the colors and patterns. Does wick away moisture ok.,0
1,These look like women’s glasses In person. Will try to return,0
5,Make me look my best😎😘😎😎,1
5,Great quality. True size. Not very heavy.,1
5,The color was off but otherwise it works great,1
5,Good style. Nice fit. Hope they truly protect eyes from electronics,1
1,"it broke after 1 day, waste of money",0
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. Sports bras are always too tight and cumbersome for me. I'm a 36A and I wanted a cute  strappy bra with a little support. I think this may double as a bathing suit top as well. This is made for A and B cups in my opinion.  I wish there were more colors.,1
5,I absolutely love this ring it’s beautiful,1
1,Complete garbage. You're basically purchasing what you would get out of one of those quarter vending machines when you were a kid. You just get one &#34;earring&#34; and it looks more like a dead bat than anything else. The thing doesn't even clasp properly so my wife couldn't take more than a few steps without this hunk of misshapen plastic falling out of her ear.  You would get more enjoyment from setting your money on fire and huffing the smoke than you would this trash.,0
5,Serious quality and soft cloth I would recommend,1
5,"Adorable! Fits our 8 month old pretty well, still a little room to grow into. It's nice that there's no foot part because she can continue to wear it after she gets bigger.",1
1,Too much money .  looks better in picture.  Fell apart after wearing once,0
1,I love these but they are the most uncomfortable slippers I have ever worn. I wish they were not so uncomfortable because they would be perfect. Very disappointed.. I am a huge slipper wearer and these have no cushion or padding and it feels like something poking through.,0
2,"Not thrilled with this one, unfortunately.  I am pregnant but still wearing a C cup, so I figured jumping up to D should do the trick.  Instead I'm left with a cup that doesn't cover my areolas, even the lace at the top isn't enough to cover them.  I have side boob and the underwire pokes me everywhere.  The image shows a bra where the cup goes up almost to the armpit, but that simply isn't the case here and the coverage is minimal.  The reason it's a pushup?  There isn't enough room for it not to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, the band is long enough and the color is gorgeous.  Also I realized after the fact that the bra I ordered is not hte one I thought I had ordered (I wanted the one with more lace at the bottom, so pay attention!)",0
5,Got these for my Halloween costume. The kids were Elmo and Cookie Monster. I was The Count.,1
1,Fell apart first day not good quality,0
5,My son loves these. Fits well and sound is great.,1
4,love it. ribbon needs to be for firmer in place but dress has withstood many washes and still holding up,1
1,This finish of setting is coming off after 2 months disappointed,0
2,Very short.,0
3,Too big.,0
2,very poor quality. washed and started to fall apart. no washing instructions so I washed on delicate.i will never order from amazon clothes again. cheap stuff.,0
5,BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER IT IS BEAUTIFUL,1
5,This watch is gorgeous!  Look much more expensive than it is.  My brother loved it.,1
1,back pieces come off super easy. GARBAGE!,0
1,"Such a waste of money! They constantly fell down, causing my toddler to walk on them. And the buttons kept unbuttoning. Cute for maybe a quick picture but literally that is ALL they're good for. I rarely write reviews but these were bad enough that I felt it was necessary.",0
2,"bought these for my wife, when she tried them on, she didn't like how they fit on her",0
2,I ordered an XL because I like my tshirts loose.  I typically wear a women’s L.  This tshirt is small.  It barely fits me and I’m guessing won’t after a few washings.  Length is not typical of an XL either.  I should have bought two sizes up.,0
3,I love the pin but unfortunately I don't love the clasp. It is very loose and I'm afraid I will lose it. The pin itself is very nice though.,0
1,Sizing is all wrong,0
1,"Poorly made, inaccurate sizing and poor quality fabric",0
5,"Was a little hard adjusting c-pap, bi-focals and prisms.  I went to granger bought stick on lenses for prisms to take one thing out  of mix.  It is easy now to put prisms with stick on lenses on first and put c-pap on second.  I now sleep with them all night and watch tv.",1
4,Sizes somewhat inconsistent. Bought 2 of these rings. Beautiful ring!,1
5,"Honestly, this apron is great because it has pockets and the material is thick which could last a long time. I just recently started cooking at home and was looking for an affordable apron and I came upon this one. Pockets can be useful for phones, notepads, towels, kitchenware, etc. I am also aware that this apron is used for other hobbies such as painting or garden work. This apron can do it all!",1
4,This dress works great for nursing and very comfortable but a little see through,1
1,"Lights arrived promptly and were cheap inexpensive lights- which for my purposes would have been fine. However, 10 did not work at all and another 5 did not work well. I feel that 15 out of 40 lights arriving to my door not functioning is unacceptable.",0
1,These pants do not look like the picture and fit awkwardly in both the ankle and crotch area.,0
5,cool watch,1
5,My wife loves this on her Galaxy Active watch. Nice quality and great price!,1
1,I got this because they said it would be perfect for and aizawa cosplay and it's too short it's very thin in it is already wearing out and I haven't worn it very much. Kind of disappointed to be honest,0
5,Great little no show socks. Very comfortable,1
4,"As others said, the band is huge and will need to have links removed.",1
1,Its like a ring you would get in a bubble gum machine with the size part. Its uncomfortable. But it was cheap and I supposed you get cheap for the price. I won't be buying these kinds of rings again.,0
5,Love the material. Sleeves are a bit long but I’m fine with that otherwise it is perfect,1
5,I’m picky about pants. Most pants are too long or too wide or gape at my waist. Let me tell you.... these are the Mary Poppins of pants - practically perfect in every way. Buy them. Just buy them.,1
5,The color is true to picture. Gorgeous cardigan. A great accessory add to my closet.,1
5,Awesome piece with a nice presence but not over the top.  Well made and sturdy.,1
3,It's not slim fit as it looks,0
2,I'm giving it 2 stars because it is soft material and looks comfortable but the size is WAY off.  My 2 year old son is on the small side (in the 10%tile / 29lbs) and wears 2T-3T underwears fine.  I bought this in size 1-2 years and it was huge!  It just feel off him.,0
2,Very thin broke,0
3,Too big.  Fitting is not comfortable,0
5,"Used it for my Boudoir photo shoot, I got many compliments and had to send out the link many times.",1
3,"Ties are fine. Good quality for the price, but they are pretty short.",0
2,Smells so much like cinnamon. Its Nauseating,0
5,Food for eat,1
3,Bigger than expected. Very pretty.,0
1,"Total junk. Black one was broken off before I even took it out of the package, and the silver one broke off after wearing it for 30 minutes. What a waste of money.",0
2,"For the price, these are outrageous. I was expecting a soft comfy long pant. No it's made out of weird dress pants materiel. The blue is so bright, they are very cheap looking for almost 30$. I mean forreal tacky. Maybe a different pattern would be better but I am definitely disappointed",0
5,"I wanted a plush robe to wear around the home, and this one is perfect.  It is very soft, and the fabric is high quality.",1
5,Es muy cómoda y se ajusta perfecto,1
4,Fits a little to big but is what I needed,1
2,"Too heavy for summer pj,s",0
3,The pin one 1 side is too short! I sent the 1st one back and got a replacement. The replacement had the same issue! I eventually replaced that pin with one I had at home but I had to cut the band slightly  to do it! I do like the color of this band and it looks nice on my wrist!,0
1,The hat that was delivered didn’t look anything like the pictures. Don’t buy it.,0
5,My husband loves it very nice,1
4,a little smaller than expected...but for fashion jewelry...very nice!,1
5,"I love this outfit. I’ve had many compliments on it. It’s easy to just pull from the closet, put it on, pair it with some cute sneakers and you’re ready to go!",1
5,I love it!,1
3,It was a gift But the person said that theywould not have payed as much as I did for it..they said it was nice but not super good quality...I'm bummed I'm spent so much,0
2,So cute but they are made for narrow feet,0
3,This was not a good fit for me. I ordered two sizes because I wasn’t quite sure which one I would fall under but both did not fit me well. The material I felt like was too heavy especially since I was trying to purchase for a beach vacation type of trip.... I thought the material would be a little softer... it was heavy and rough. I had to return.,0
5,Purchased for a friend who collects watches. Went with the blue and dark wood coloring. He absolutely loved it. Excellent gift for anyone.,1
1,These pants have enough stretch that I'm sure you could put them on a whale however if you are plus size these pants are like low riders,0
5,"Comfy! Material causes less sweating which allows me to breathe! Less rubbing. Not restricting. I gained some weight and fluctuate between L & XL. This one (XL) has room, doesn't feel loose or anything but isn't tight. I hope to lose weight and when I do, I'd still continue to purchase these!",1
5,Pretty earrings.  I have enjoyed wearing them.,1
5,"I was pleased with this bag. It's a great size and seems to be made very well. The leather (I think it's real leather) seems good quality, the stitching is even and well done and it seems to be quality made/sturdy. I am happy with my purchase.",1
3,Cute dress nice feeling fabric but too shirt for y’all girls. 5 11” and it was half was up my calf,0
1,"I should of know better, fell apart and you can not fit a laptop in it, the top tappers in making it narrow and impossible to get a laptop in, my ipad fits but it smaller and my laptop in not huge BUY American!",0
1,I have the Nike Dri-fit long sleeve shirt in black and was excited to purchase another one. When I ordered the white one it was way too small and see-through. I sadly had to return it.,0
3,"The skirt is nice looking. I liked the color and the style. However, I found the material a little itchy and uncomfortable.",0
5,"Note...  If you buy the please know that the cobbler will sand the bottom of the Louboutin to apply these soils. But they make it so much easier to walk on marble, wooden and laminated floors. Its a one size fit all sole so don't worry they cobbler knows what to do when you get them repaired.",1
5,Fits very nicely. I'm 5-4 and the dress ends just at my knees. Perfect for Sunday or another occasion where you must dress nicely.<br />Fabric is thicker than expected.<br />I'm an XL in most of my clothes including this dress. I carry my excess weight in my belly almost entirely due to separated abdominal muscles and this dress is still flattering to my figure.,1
5, ,1
5,great,1
1,Not flattering for me,0
5,You can definitely tell a difference visually when you take the glasses on or off. They do work as advertised! Not only also my eyes not feel as strained after a week of wearing them. I have gotten so many compliments from people as to how good they look on me.,1
3,The blouse is pretty and sheer not true to size according to chart. Snugg fitting under arm hole and bust areas ordered a medium too small will re-order in a large,0
5,"I ended up buying this in multiple colors. Love the fit and pattern. It’s not one of those sweaters that shed when washed. I also have a dog, and it’s not sucking up all dog hair like some sweaters.",1
5,Use it while riding motorcycle. Stays in place,1
5,Great,1
3,I ordered my normal size as it said and it’s a bit tight around the bust. The sleeves fit fine and everything else is good though. It’s comfortable.,0
5,"Nice, thank you! Very feminine.",1
5,The colors of these dresses are bright and beautiful. The fabric feels neat. They are comfortable and fit well. They really are perfect play dresses.,1
2,Looked like a granny dress in person. Returned it.,0
5,Good quality ..Its a statement outfit ..you'll get compliments ev every where u go guaranteed 😎,1
3,Really wasn’t expecting such a cheap iron decal to be applied to the front of the hat,0
5,Si buscas un cronógrafo de tamaño ajustado esta es una muy buena opción,1
5,"Liked the style, but is not XXL as for plus sizes way too small",1
5,Lovely!,1
2,Ordered an xl but it looks like a medium. The material is more like an under armour shirt instead of a t-shirt material.,0
2,These tarnished quickly. I only have 3 that haven't yet & I have only had them for a month.,0
5,was a gift purchase & she loves it!!,1
5,Simple and easy to use. Cut to size from the different upsizes and coil onto your ring! Bought these for my wedding band when I accidentally bought a half size too big they work like a charm!,1
4,"They have good stretch, love the length and fit",1
2,Runs small too tight,0
4,"I've used the other Machingers gloves and loved them.  I was a little skeptical about the low price of these.  But I teach a sewing/quilting class at our local Senior Center, and wanted to get the ladies some inexpensive gloves.  I tried them myself and they are almost as good as the higher priced gloves, and certainly a lot better than nothing!",1
2,Did not fit around my waist even though I checked the measurements.,0
3,"I like it but even as an adjustable it is small.  I ordered it for my boyfriend and it is too small for a mans wrist.  It does fit mine, so I will wear it, but now searching for one for a man.",0
1,"Ordered a 2X and it fits my size 6 daughter, don't get.  The quality is nice, but sizing waaaaaay off!",0
3,"however the lock changed color quickly, the stone fell off too soon.  I wish if the bracelet was a little bigger. nonetheless,<br />I love it and still wear it.",0
5,I love the look and the way it fits!,1
5,Easy to switch band. Holding up well. It's slightly stiff at first but I would buy it again,1
5,"Love love love!<br />These are great! True Tom Ford glasses with authentic packing, case and cleaning cloth. Very happy with my purchase.",1
2,"not 6 inches as described, more like 11-12 inches.",0
5,Beautiful dress. Love it! Thank you 😊,1
5,So soft and the color is great (green). Love the neck and sleeves. I’m 7 months pregnant and needed something comfortable but nice looking for thanksgiving. This was perfect. Washes great. Stayed soft and didn’t pill. Will  need to get more colors!!,1
1,"My size in my country is 42inc, and when i checked ur item size it says that the XXL is 45 , but when i recived the item it was smaller  and it says XL. I need you please to fix up this issue for me ASP . I cant wear it at all. So please as a trusted saler that i picked among all fix this for me",0
2,Began unraveling after first wear,0
2,Hard to get on. Were not east on,0
3,"Too small - XL fit like a L.  Tight in the shoulders and chest.  Arm length was short.  Returned item.  Also, material didn't seem durable.",0
5,Nice fit,1
5,Thank you,1
5,Ok I'm really surprised usually I order bras am they don't fit or the pad on them is weird but these are actually comfortable! The lace isn't itchy which I thought it would be. I love these bras an 3 bras for that price is great usually one bra is 26 or more alone for a good fitting one. Thanks!,1
2,"Half the buttons fell off the first time I washed it. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Disappointing because I've purchased other PattyBoutik shirts that are great. They fit well for tall, slender body types. Usually sleeves are too short but this brand always fits.",0
5,Hides my mommy bulge and stretch marks ;),1
4,"I wanted a Random Ghost for a long time and I purchased this as soon as it was available.  I received a nice color combination (not the best I have seen but far from the worst), very happy with the watch.  I would give the watch itself 5 stars.  I gave this 4 stars (was debating 3) as the packaging was poor.  The plastic Swatch box was almost destroyed.  Almost snapped in half (2 small places holding it together) and one corner has the plastic chipped off and completely missing.  Which almost goes to show this was shipped damaged.  Watch is fine and in great shape, which is why I am keeping this",1
5,Bought a bunch of them to organize my hiking and climbing gear. Well made and lots of colors to choose from. I think I just bought a dozen of them,1
5,They fit great and wash well.,1
5,Great quality and vibrant color. It was an added bonus that the seller added a little something extra,1
1,Not good at all! Too small and broken,0
1,Received these today. I washed them before using and the stitching came undone in the wash.<br /><br />The material feels great but is very thin and silky.,0
5,I loved it. It was comfortable and it did its job,1
3,Glad I ordered a large because it fits smaller especially around the shoulders.,0
3,"I had high hopes for this top, but I had to return it. It was too small around the neck and even though I typically wear a L-Xl in workout tops this was too small overall in the XL. If you prefer slim fit this would work for you. Returning it was a breeze.",0
5,Beautiful dress.  Washes great.,1
5,"The booties are adorable and fit like a glove. Most importantly, they are very comfortable and I'm loving the sage color for a nice change. I wouldn't hesitate ordering them in another color.",1
5,just what she wanted,1
5,the price is great...cuz most places would cost at least $10 for this pair!! very classy!!! there long...about elbow length...fit perfect!!! great quailty!!!,1
5,just perfect! Am ordering another one,1
5,"When looking at it, I didn't think it would fit but it did! Don't expect a dramatic decrease in appearance, however, it does do a good job of compression and control.",1
1,Could barely see the name Ranger on the hat. Very disappointed,0
3,Decent for just regular wear not great for competive as a few times my done got a fish of water in them .. it does fog .. and doesn’t last more than 3-4 months tops . Plastic clip breaks,0
4,"Dress looks great on my wife overall, but I rated it 4 of 5 and said it was &#34;somewhat small&#34; because the zipper is a bit hard to close for both my wife and even for me working at a better angle--could simply be a quality control issue on this particular dress or could be that it was made just a bit too small.",1
3,Power is right. Some reading glasses are thicker than others making them a little heavier. These are pretty thick.,0
3,"Shirt will be ruined before too long with how easily it gets snagged on anything. If you have pets, wear rings, or around others who wear rings - you’re doomed. Cute shirt though while it’ll last.",0
5,It is very comfortable.,1
5,Exactly what I ordered and great quality.,1
2,It's very cheaply made and doesn't fit the description; it is NOT even close to backless :( I'm so disappointed. It doesn't look very much like the pic at all :(,0
3,"They are ok, I have had better, sort of stiff and harsh and actually prefer the three pack for $10 at the H..D...",0
1,Sock size is too small<br /><br />CAUTION CANNOT RETURN ITEM,0
5,Super comfortable,1
1,Went according to the size chart and still was waaaaay to small. Not impressed.,0
5,The material is super soft! It fits perfectly! It hugs my curves but also has stretch. The material IS NOT see through.,1
2,"Run small, find them to be uncomfortable.  Worn once or twice,  sitting unused in a drawer.",0
1,Cheaply made and cheap looking. Fall apart.,0
2,"Ticks very loudly, and the hands frequently freeze up. I woke up today and the time was off by 2 hours and 15 minutes. Extremely dissatisfied",0
5,Love this shirt! It came in the mail very quickly. The material is so soft and comfortable. It fits true to size. Deffinately a new favorite and perfect for summer weather. Great shirt for any pitbull mom.,1
5,My brother loves his watch. I got it for him as a bday gift.,1
3,"Really small for adult use, does not stretch. Small face or kids only",0
5,Have as a gift for a gal going to Mexico for a vacation. She loves it!,1
5,I bought this for my daughter for in the winter. It’s super cute and fit her great!,1
1,Didn't like it,0
3,huh,0
5,"Muy lindos, solo que 2 llegaron rotos",1
1,"If you're going to buy something based on reviews like I did, pick something that has a lot of reviews unlike these glasses.<br /><br />They're cute, lightweight, comfortable, but they broke today and I just received them yesterday. I didn't handle them rough at all.<br /><br />I need reader to check expiration dates. So I will open and close my glasses many times in a day. The third time I opened them to put them on, the arm just came off.<br /><br />For over $20 dollars ( that I paid for these ) you can buy one really good pair of readers. Don't waste your money on these",0
5,"I really like this top. I like that the straps are Adjustable. Also, the flow of the top hides my mid section very well. It’s trendy and goes great with jeans. I bought it in black and washed it before wearing it. The color did not fade at all.",1
5,The kids loved these and they are great products.,1
5,"Great buy! bought them for my boyfriend and he was pleased! They came in a timely manner, packaged nicely and where perfect size- not to big not to small-great quality! I would buy again!",1
5,"it’s a little longer than I thought it would be, but other than that it’s perfet! Great fit. Can’t wait to wear it this summer.",1
3,I would love it if the post wasn't so very long. I can't wear it because it's constantly spinning around.,0
5,Suaves y comodas,1
5,Nice!,1
1,I did already go a size up after reading the reviews and when I received it was still too small maybe two sizes up but I'm not going to bother,0
3,"Very thin, don’t sustain washing well.",0
5,Very pretty,1
2,The color is not same as picture.,0
1,Made very cheaply.  Probably going to send back,0
1,The elastic band on these shorts is infuriating. Every time you pull them on or off it gets bunches up and I had to spend minutes adjusting it through the fabric to make it flat and untwisted again. They go all the way up to your belly button and and the waist is pretty tight compared to the looseness of the legs. The styles not bad and quality of linen isn’t bad either. But I only wore these for two days and was done.,0
3,"This is very pretty (as expected). Good quality material. It is very fitted so for me, 5’ 6” and 140 lbs, it made me a little self conscious about my belly bump even in my spandx. I really like it but will most likely return only because of my self consciousness.",0
4,It’s a bit thick around my wrist but I am hoping it loosens so I don’t feel the thickness around my wrist. I was expecting Snoopy’ color being bolder and darker but it’s ok.,1
5,Just what I wanted!!,1
3,I loved this bag but it ripped to soon. You get what you pay for.,0
5,Nice to have all the Sailor Scouts as chibi and not just Sailor Moon even if she is my favorite. I love them all. Get it you know you want to ;),1
2,No me gusto el material,0
2,Shrunk after one wash.,0
2,"Blackburn rack only, well the description says it'll work on any rack it won't only specific racks that have a narrow mounting strips to wrap the tiedowns  around. The second feeling of this morning system is that every time you want to mount you have to reach underneath the rack where your tires probably dirty in the bottom of the bag is probably dirty so it's not easy to take on and off of the rack which may be a benefit if you're going to leave it on all the time.<br /> Otherwise it's it seems to be a really nice waterproof bag with waterproof zippers with the with the zippers protected with a zipper garage on the side pocket and a flap over the top opening in the magnetical downs for the dry bag style top.<br />Unfortunately due to the restriction of mounting it wouldn't fit on any my bikes  so it is getting returned",0
3,"Lovely color but didn’t fit me right.  At 5’3, it was too long.  The top part was slightly small so didn’t follow the shape of my curves.  It would probably fit size B or small C cup better.  If I had enough time before my event I would have had it altered as I really liked the color and how it looked otherwise.",0
5,"Beautiful, many compliments. Very light.",1
5,Love the secure zipper part for cc,1

5,Gorgeous earrings. Love it. Exactly like the picture.,1
5,"I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH CREATIVE HAIR PIECES AND FASCINATORS NOW. SINCE I HAVE DISCOVERED THEM, I HAVE TRIED AS MANY AS POSSIBLY AND I THINK THIS ONE IS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED ONE THAT I HAVE BOUGHT YET. IT IS LARGE, CAME BEAUTIFULLY PACKAGED, AND IS GORGEOUS. IT FITS WELL IN THE HAIR AND SITS NICELY. I AM SO GLAD I STEPPED INTO THIS WORLD OF ELEGANCE AND FOUND THIS EXPERT QUALITY HEADPIECE FROM FAYBOX!<br /><br />SHIPPING WAS FAST ENOUGH AND THEY HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE MY OWN AND I HOPE IT HELPS. I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT!.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34; below where it says &#34;Was this review helpful to you?&#34;",1
3,"This bag is a really cute color—young and fun.  Since it has both a wrist strap and a shoulder strap, it offers convenient carrying options. The outside phone compartment snaps securely and has decorative tassels. The inside, as shown above, has slots for credit cards/ID and several folder pockets for cash, etc.  However, this is where the design breaks down.  I would not be comfortable using this bag for carrying anything of significance because the foldover part of the cross body bag is completely unsecured except for a snap. (Note the lack of zipper in Photo 1 above.)  Though there is a small zippered compartment on the backside of the bag, it holds very little. It did come with a complementary “backpack,” a nice bonus (see photo 2 above).  Still, for the lack of security, I could only award the bag—even though it’s stylish—3 stars.",0
3,Does not look like the picture at all.,0
1,Terrible ripped in less that two weeks,0
5,My daughter Loved these shorts ! Fit perfectly and feels good! Definitely will buy again !,1
1,The beanie hat was too small and snug for my head.,0
5,"This outfit was even cuter than I expected. My niece loved the pink bows on the leggings. I was hesitant about ordering based on age. She will be 5 soon, wears a 6-6x, but the 5-6 y/o size fit great. I will be ordering more!!",1
5,"Very nice and well made, easy to replace and looks good",1
1,"My husband begged me to order a pair for him after a TV advertisement,reluctant I did. Received them today and I put one pair on to look at the back yard but was not able to focus on any thing, a beautiful red cardinal sitting on the fence looked like a red fuzzy ball.There was no packing slip or any paper in the package that stated the amount of the purchase, or a way to return it. I got a little suspicious and checked with the credit card company to enquire about the charge for that transaction and I got the shock: $88.80 instead of $25.90.Tried to contact Apg Zoomies to no avail so I called back the credit card company, reported the episode and cancelled the card. Sure do no trust those people. Big scam.",0
5,"I purchased this for my sister's birthday, and it's every bit as beautiful as it sounds!",1
2,It definitely looks  way better on the model on the site than in real life. You don’t really see the shoulder effect as the photo shows:(,0
5,"These are my 6 year old son's favorite. I even wear them sometimes to drown out the kids in the car when they get so loud about silly stuff such as, &#34;she is looking out my window.&#34; They are very comfortable. They add just the right amount of pressure that I even find it soothing. Most sunglasses and head bands have always given me headaches, but this does not. We prefer Hear Tek  over the Vic firth, and Snug kid earmuffs. You can still hear people very close to you talking, but it drowns out a lot of noise and what you do still hear is much softer.",1
5,nice gift for new grad,1
3,like the look,0
1,Cheap,0
5,Very cute outfit to take baby's newborn photos.,1
3,"I like this hat, it is very cute, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. I wore it once and the flowers have come away a little already. There is a red woolen thread that sticks out no matter what I do and is pretty obvious. Why in earth would you use red thread on a gray hat?",0
1,Way to small. I can't wear it because it won't fit around my ankle. Ugh!,0
5,"Bought this shirt for my husband, to replace the old one he use to have. It fits perfect, and it's a good quality shirt. He really liked it a lot. :-)",1
1,cheap looking and broke after a week of use,0
5,They are good,1
5,They all very cute and not at all heavy. Really like them.,1
3,Love this band but as it wears it has a sharp metal peice stabbing my arm,0
4,excellent,1
5,Buena,1
4,Fit a little big on my grandson but he wears it over a shirt anyways. He loves it. He's 9yrs old,1
3,"Cute coverup, but if you want to wear it alone, good luck.. it's super thin material/see through.",0
1,"Poor quality, very very blurry. Avoid so your wife won’t be disappointed too!",0
5,"I bought this watch band because the band my used LG Urbane came with was too big.<br /><br />This watch band has lasted well over 6 months will no visible signs of tear (although surprisingly vintage-looking signs of wear). I have worn it every day for 6 months, including submerging it in chlorinated and non-chlorinated water. When submerged, the leather takes a bit to dry, but appears otherwise unharmed afterwards. Easy installation and a range of sizes makes this watch band extremely convenient and definitely worth the money!",1
1,My son has a pair of older Aviators that someone gave him. I cannot find a set of screws to fit these things anywhere. Everything is too big.,0
5,My son loves them,1
5,"Great skort for comfort, and it's cute! I recommend this for casual, dressy, or sporty wear, depending on what you wear with it.",1
5,Better quality than I've managed to get from hot topic lately. Honestly I'm flabbergasted. This skeleton top is legit perfect. I'm 5'1' 140 pounds and I got the medium as thats what I usually get everywhere and it fits perfect.,1
2,cheap material and it gave me infection.,0
5,title says it all.,1
1,"[[VIDEOID:1611bdec7f46e7187989b29ab85507b9]] These are the most uncomfortable shoes my wife and I have ever purchased in our entire lives. They were never waterproof as advertised. The steel toe rubs your toes into blisters and corns even tho they were big,because the steel toe part has always been open.",0
1,"I read the reviews before purchasing and I am usually a small or medium so I ordered XL since many reviews said it's too small and suggested to  order 2 sizes up. To my disappointment, an XL doesn't fit at all- especially in the rear. As an alternative use, I asked my daughter to try them on and they fit her almost perfectly. For reference, she wears a children's size 7/8!<br /><br />So now instead of returning them, she is going to wear them as pajama shorts. Another thing to note is that if you have any sizeable rear, these do not allow any room for this- both front and back is the same cut so if you need any extra room for your caboose to be covered, these are not for you..",0
2,I am 5’9 and it came to my calf.....it is not long (maxi) I like mine sweeping the ground<br />Don’t beLieve reviews def not made for y’all girls.....I am giving it to my short girlfriend,0
1,I purchased this necklace because the description said “ light gold”. It is not light gold at all. It appears to be more like brassy tone. Very cheap looking. Returning it.,0
4,Fit was good.  Very comfortable to wear.,1
5,I love this shirt! So cute and a great fit!,1
5,"Couldn’t be happier with the quality and fit, especially for the price. It’ll need to steamed before wearing, but I plan To put it In a<br />dry cleaning bag and Throw it In The dryer before my trip. And then hang in bathroom at hotel with shower on and spray with “wrinkle out.” I got this for a Conference with special cocktail events at night I got a small and I’m 5’5, 128 pounds and a 36DD. The fit is very tight and extremely flattering, just the way I wanted it. For those that like a loser more relaxed fit I’m sure sizing up could be an option, but I’d be concerned about the bodice staying up since it a shoulder dress, and has lace on The top. I’m wearing this with a crinoline petticoat underneath. But also plan to wear without the skirt for different occasions or different looks. Love it. Hope my review helps your decision.",1
5,"Awesome bag. Great quality and nice vintage look.<br />I bought as a carry all. It is too large for me for everyday, more like a weekend or beach bag. That is not complaint. I am keeping it and will buy another that is a little smaller.",1
3,Fits every where but in the top,0
5,I've had this for a few months now and wear it every week. It holds up. Love how it feels too.,1
2,Extremely small. If your a medium buy XL if your a large or bigger don't bother!,0
5,Exactly what was advertised. Worth getting the OEM model.,1
5,Love it!,1
5,It was positive and I gave them to my daughters. A little small!,1
5,I really like it.,1
4,"I bought several of these and the sizing is all over the place! Big. Little. Just right. Because it fits loosely, the size variation didn’t matter too much except for the really tiny one I just gave away. I ordered a size up. The price is good and the quality is good for that price. I liked them enough I bought five.",1
3,They have one pocket.  One pocket that will not hold an iPhone 12 completely.  About half the phone sticks out.  I don’t think it will fall out but I would not trust on a bicycle.,0
5,Ordered this shirt for my grandson. The colors are vivid and bright. The shirt is made of nice material and feels good. A great buy.,1
5,Darling top. Great for work. I love it. It fits great!,1
3,cheap... but the company sent me another and between the two I have one.. nice look,0
5,They were perfect!  Better then I expected.  The wings were easy for my 11 year old to wear and she was able to have fun with her makeup too!,1
5,"The necklace could not be more perfect.  It is wonderfully made, the pearls are all matching size and color.  I am impressed with the quality considering the price.<br />Service was wonderful.",1
3,Very cheap,0
3,"The skirt itself is fine, but do not be fooled by the pictures, it is not neon green, it is neon yellow. The waist fits extremely tight, but length is fine. I ordered a size medium.",0
2,I love the look of this watch but we have not had it in possession as it has been to the repair shop several times. I highly recommend fossil but this one might not be worth the effort.,0
5,My man was really happy with these. They come well packaged and look real classy with a suit.,1
2,Way too small.  Material is really thin.  Cute but wouldn't order another one.,0
1,fits too small,0
4,[[VIDEOID:1a28dfbb368f3fcd36c325773e0efefa]] The kimono fits perfect and I think the earrings are adorable!,1
5,"I've previously ordered and worn a pale blue version of this skirt, and was not let down by the white version. The petticoat is the length pictured, and works beautifully to give the appearance of a nice, full skirt.",1
3,Looks and feels like a good quality hat. Not a one size fits all. It’s made for extra large size heads only. I wear a size M/L flexfit and this was much bigger than that. I will be returning this item.,0
3,When I ordered this I had no idea it was coming from China and needed it for a shower.  Finally received it and the item is cute but with PRIME I would have expected more.,0
3,"This shoe was stiff and had zero flex. Not at all comfortable. Also runs a bit small, we choose to err on the side of caution and return.",0
3,Indoors only more like at home use. See through,0
5,&#34;Excellent price. I like it.Does the same thing as the camelback but for a quarter of the price.<br />&#34;,1
5,Look on line people use these to anchor our pwc down. Works great,1
5,Cozy and cute I just can't get enough of these boot socks AND I need to have them in every color I actually ordered these (my second pair) as a Christmas gift for a co-worker...but they are so cute... I am thinking I may need to keep them and get her another pair!!!,1
5,Good.,1
5,Great buy my adult niece loves this,1
5,Soft and cute colorful print,1
5,Made my female friend happy,1
1,Cheap and awkward chain length,0
1,Received item broken. Gave as a gift. Too fine of an item. Did not get full refund.,0
5,Really pretty everyday earrings. Good quality and price I bought rose gold but they come in yellow gold and silver,1
2,"They are definitely not like what they advertised. They are cheaply made, but I guess they are okay for that price. Just look at my picture and you will see.",0
3,"The band is good quality metal and very sturdy however, the color rubs off after a while. I purchased in February and put on the watch in March 2020 and now by November 2020 the band is discolored. Very disappointed.",0
2,While I'm excited about the colors and the fact that they arrived in a timely fashion. I am disappointed that one of the watches is cracked. If I didn't need to use one tomorrow for school I'd be sending them all back.,0
4,"Nice overall shaping , wish the top  would come up higher under the arms.",1
4,"I like it a lot.  It does just what it says it does.  The Elastic holds tightly and I cant forcefully fling the cards or cash out of the sleeve.  It holds all the cards I have, and the slots make it easy to get the cards in/out.  Not sure about the RFID blocking though.  As you can see in the photos the chip shows through the gaps in the carbon fiber.  I'm not sure how that will affect the RFID Blocking.  Tempted to get an RFID scanner just to test it, but that would be an expensive test.",1
4,"I’ve actually gotten great use out of this wig. I initially bought it back in 2015 for a cosplay I was doing. It’s certainly a costume wig. However, I pulled her out of my dusty storage bin, gave her a face lift and now I can wear this hair for more fun. 4 stars bexase you can see the tracks through the hair in several areas, but for $10 it’s beeb fun.",1
4,"The jacket is cute, but the fabric does not stretch  and it's a bit itchy.",1
1,Actually returned this product. Thin and cheaply made.,0
5,Loved my clown costume... Fit perfectly... Very colorful... Reasonably priced. Very satisfied.,1
1,"Purchased a large, it is about the size of a medium.  purchased military green, it showed up in gray.  I was under the impression that it was a sweatshirt, its a long sleeve t-shirt.  will be returning this item.  do not purchase, quality is cheap.",0
3,Pretty but not glow in the dark. the necklace is pretty however.,0
1,Runs very small,0
3,"Nice shirt, but made small.",0
5,It was a little smaller than I expected but we still like the shirt and it arrived on time as I ordered it a little later than I normally would have but it arrived before my son's birthday !!!,1
5,Beautiful dress had to send back because I didn't need it anymore.,1
5,"Highly recommended for anyone looking to portray their inner Jedi, without breaking the bank.",1
5,"Purchased as a gift.  Arrived and prettier than expected.  Recipient was over the moon.  Tassel earrings can be, too long, too wide and too heavy.  These were just right.",1
1,"Fit great for one round. Then the tightening holes started to rip/“hog” out. So now I have to go tighter with the band than is comfortable. If I go looser than the watch rolls around the wrist. After a couple of rounds going tighter than is comfortable, that hole is “hogged out”. Cannot wear anymore",0
1,I really loved the way the nose ring looked on me. It is not bendable so it could not stay on my nose. Both rings slipped off my body is.,0
3,"Pants are nice but I'm giving the 3 stars because I returned them. The white did not cover well, too see thru for me.",0
4,Nice pictures. These are the same pictures that come with the album.,1
2,"They fit as expected.  However, they scratched up really easily.  Cheap replacements.",0
4,Would be great for someone else. Too much cleavage enhancement for this buyer but nice color and fit otherwise.,1
5,Bought this for my daughter before her Disney trip in early March 2020. She said it was super comfy to wear throughout the day. Good quality for the price.,1
1,This shirt is paper thin compared to a Diluth shirt they should have someone else design this apparel for them.  Not for winter wear maybe at the beach!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
1,Was happy I was getting a great deal but that's all I got. I never got the package in the mail. I did apply for a refund and never heard back however if they are gonna run a promotion they should have better tracking on their packages too,0
5,Perfect!!! The emblem chain is in the pocket!!! Love this purse!!!!,1
5,Excelente calidad,1
5,My son loves this mask. Nice full head with eye slits that provide good vision!,1
2,Breasts pop out of the bra especially when you bend down,0
5,"Ordered 2 for my mother (one for her, one for her friend). She loved them, and loved the gifts she was sent just as much, and neither of us were expecting those! Thank you again!",1
2,Made very cheap and slightly small. Sent mine back.,0
5,A very elegant dress at a very good price.,1
5,"Firat time buying a flat cap,  been wanting one for years. Fits perfect and looks awesome.",1
5,Perfect fit. Sized just right. Great quality.,1
2,Not great material,0
5,"Absolute top notch product!!! My daughter loves it. Excellent customer service, Great interaction with Bloomouflage team!!",1
1,"The description says 6 pairs of socks for $13.99. I placed an order for 3 units, which should be 18 pairs of socks. Unfortunately all I received were 9 pair of socks. There is no way to speak to anyone to correct the order. So I set up a return. Tried to reorder but once again only received 1/2 of the quantity ordered. So will return them also.",0
2,Cheap and not worth it at any price,0
3,"They fit and she doesn't mind them on, improvement could make them a 5 star, if the height length was increased by 2-3&#34;inches.",0
1,They don't fit snugly in the heel at all I expected them to be a better fit and am super disappointed.,0
3,"My entire family made fun of me when I wore these glasses. They are bigger then they look or maybe I have a small face, I don't know, but I was ridiculed so much over the holidays that now I don't want to wear them. Sigh...because they help me see! Jerks!",0
2,CHEap Payless shoes,0
4,Pretty,1
2,"The photos are hard to make out, but my bag came with scuff marks all over it, and one of the handles was completely twisted.  I fixed the handle, but it just feels like I spent $60 on a bag someone else used and returned. I'd return it but I don't even want to deal with the hassle. Just a buyer beware.",0
1,causes infection,0
5,Bought  it to go with my new G90 5.0<br />Can’t wait for it to warm up enough to rock it. It looks just like picture.,1
1,Socks so tight and non-stretch that I couldn't get them on.  Glad I only bought one pair.  No more for me.,0
1,"I am disappointed with these earrings, they broke the first day I tried to wear them. They are too small...but I guess you shouldn't expect too much from cheap earrings.",0
1,Ring material too soft..bends up easily.,0
3,By no means burgundy. Bright red. Also seems a big for a medium so I would order down a size.<br />If you're looking for plain red then this will be for you. Sadly I was wanting maroon/burgundy.,0
5,"Keeps good time, nice looking and is indeed stainless steal. I'm allergic to some metals so stainless is a must.",1
3,"I'm not sure mine are polarized to be honest. Usually when wearing polarized glasses, you can see into water a little bit because glare/reflection/whatever is removed. I take my daughter to the pond to feed the fish and the glare is horrible. They are cute and I've gotten compliments on them, but feel my glasses somehow missed the polarizing process or something. They came in good condition and are cute.",0
5,"This item is lightweight, but perfect for me and the Oregon winter nights.  It runs a bit large, in my opinion.  But I would rather it be looser fitting as it is less difficult to turn over in bed, I think.",1
1,Thought it was going to be cotton t shirt its more like polyester does not look like picture,0
4,This close fit boxer mens underwear is enjoyable for me to wear.  There is no riding up with this product. You are at ease sitting or standing.,1
5,This is a great hoodie.  Runs small as stated so ordered a size up.,1
3,It's runs very small..I got medium. It fit but little snug. I would up size if like it little roomy.,0
3,Ok but runs small. It would probably be better if it wasn't so small for the size. I always order the same size from all companies& this is the first time it's been that far off.,0
1,"Color looked more like an OD green. Bought for a citizen eco drive. Came with 4 pins, too bad they didn’t fit and were way too short. Double checked to see if I ordered the right band since the color looked off, order says I got the 20 mm dark khaki. I’m using the stock citizen 20 mm pins. I’ll see how the strap holds up. Disappointed in the pins and color.",0
2,It looked really nice but It already broke,0
4,"Super cute!! Arrived very quickly and had to put them on right away, :)",1
1,"For me, it was not made well. It did not come down over the nipple,  but instead just flipped and a downward position. Also, the bar was also made to look worn. When putting it in, it was painful.  I wore just the bar around for about two days, and I ended up having to take it out. Sad. Very cute to look at, but it is just not made to fit correctly",0
5,Awesome,1
3,"I was disappointed in the picture. The graphics were nowhere near as sharp as the picture made it look like. I was looking forward to this, and it just wasn't as nice as the picture. It was soft and silky and comfortable, though. But with a pixelated picture, I just can't see wearing it.",0
3,Super cute style.  Sadly material is very clingy and unforgiving.  Additionally it runs small!  Size chart said I should order M - L.  I ordered L hoping it would be a bit loose and it was too tight! Sadly I returned it.,0
5,A very delicate item in appearance but very sturdy in function. Nice quality at fare price. Would purchase more if available.,1
5,"So far, these are the best shirt stays I have found. Other brands were cheaply made and did not stay attached. When walking/working, they would come lose. These stay fastened. The clips are well made and seem very durable. I like the &#34;Y&#34; design, which cuts the number of conventional straps  in half. This is based on two weeks of use.",1
3,These are much chunkier than I had envisioned. They also slide down and become a bit uncomfortable.,0
5,"I liked the material and cut, but the shoulder straps were short",1
3,"The earrings look nice, they are cheap and brake easily.",0
5,I bought this for my daughter who usually wears a girls XL 14/16 or a women's small. The design may be a little grown up for her but it looks so good and it fit perfectly.,1
2,"I ordered them cause price was cheap & you get 2, truth be told, you get what you pay for.  At 1st I gave a great review, they came fast, we’re very pretty.  However after wearing it for couple of weeks, I sleep w my nose jewelry, only time I remove it, is when I bathe, that’s when I clean the jewelry too.  It turned my nose hole black! That’s never happened to me before! So, they’re definetly Not Stainless Steel.  If you want to wear them, I suggest just for the day, & then change back into 14k gold or stainless steel one, because who knows what they’re made of, not worth infection.  So though I was pleased at 1st.....I’m definetly NOT PLEASED ANY LONGER",0
5,Fast shipping very nice product !,1
5,My daughter looked amazing in it and it was a very pretty dress. Fit perfectly.,1
5,"I purchased this dress for my high school graduation, and I loved it! I am usually a small and this dress fit according to size. I didn't expect great quality from an amazon dress, but I was impressed, and I've worn it many times since then. It is adorable and I highly reccomend--I've gotten many compliments on this!!",1
3,Tried to put the one on a hen and it didn't want to snap. Realized a piece was missing off the snap. So it is useless.  I haven't tried the other one in the package yet.,0
3,They’re nice earrings but they’re really kinda big and look a bit funny because of that. Would love them if they were several centimeters smaller.,0
2,After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd live rhese but the stone and setting was a bit dull.,0
3,"It's a cute concept. I'm 5'4&#34; - 120lbs - 32/34a and a small was weird. The top was slightly loose in the boobs but the arms fit fine and then no matter where I put the skirt it was too tight.. even when it was on the smallest part of my stomach. The grey was a light grey/washed out purple.<br />Again, super cute product but order a size up and only order if you have a rack.. honestly - even with a push up, I don't think I can fill this top out.",0
3,"I can’t quite put my finger on it, but this set isn’t as flattering as I’d hoped it would be.  The material is good and warm.  The color is nice, but just doesn’t give like it was supposed to.",0
2,"I'm a very tiny person (like 90 lbs at 5' 4"") so I ordered a small and it is unbelievably small to the point I could barely breathe. It was a struggle to get it back off. The material was okay, not wonderful but not terrible. It didn't go as high up as the picture shows either which was a disappointment. Unfortunately I waited to try it on after the return period had ended so now I'm stuck with it",0
4,The material is super thin!,1
3,The patterns are off and they are way too short.,0
3,It’s smaller than a size 12 in girls fits more like a 7/8 or  a 9/10,0
1,Extremely small,0
5,"Genuine leather is the way to go for belts, at least for myself anyway. The cost may be higher than other belts I’ve purchased but is worth it.",1
5,"Love these scrubs, Lightweight, lots of pockets & the material is nice & cool, especially for hot summer weather. I will definitely buy these again.",1
3,"Too small of a face, gave to grandchild",0
5,Very nice fit,1
5,Nice colors!,1
5,Great style and looks.  I would by another pair (different color) again.,1
3,"My son liked the watch, and the feature of multiple alarms was great. However, it quit working after few month, from being splashed with water. It says water proof, but it's not. We contacted the company, and they said they will send us another one, but it's been 2 months now and we didn't receive anything. We can't even look up the order since it's past 6 months since we bought it. Overall, I liked the watch, but I think it's overpriced for the quality.",0
4,"1)Product looks great, but enclosed screw drivers lasted long enough to unscrew one side and did nothing on other side.<br />They apparently stripped and just spin in the screws. I even cut off the old broken band and held pin with a needle nose plier and was unable to loosen screw from either side.<br />What size torx  is it? A #5 or 6?<br />I will give a rating after I get it on my wrist.<br />I was hoping to be wearing it today.<br />Thanks, Fred<br />PS I am being forced to give a star rating by amazon.<br />2)Next day, I bought a #6 Torx screwdriver of better quality and had it apart in a few minutes.<br />Put band on and it was a little large. Using the enclosed tool, I removed a link and put it back together. Fits great now.<br />I edited my post and will give a higher rating. Link tool worked great.<br />Thanks, Fred",1
5,Quality seems very nice. My fiancé loves it and wears it often. If he’s happy then I’m happy 😊,1
4,"Ok for the money, I guess. I swear I read and re-read the description, but was still disappointed when it arrived. Its black and its bold and its big. Not very comfortable to wear, pretty thick. Not complaining, as it was inexpensive as heck. I'll wear it occasionally.",1
1,"I did not get the glasses I ordered. I ordered blue, got black & totally different style. No paw prints on lenses. Very disappointed.",0
5,Great summer dress! Fits loose like I wanted.,1
3,"It's a flat belt, but not exactly what I was looking for.",0
5,Comfortable and looks great on!,1
5,High quality material for the price!,1
5,"Exactly like what's being shown and good quality,",1
5,My son really likes these.  He is 11 and they are the perfect size for him.,1
3,"Not as ""polished"" as the picture portrays",0
3,Crei que tenia mejor materia prima.,0
2,Was too large.  Did not like the edging around the neck.  Made the top look cheaper.  Have other Jess N Jane that fit better and necklines are better.,0

5,"I love these pants!  That being said, the sizing for the waist is different than expected.  I wear a 30"" waist and usually that is a little loose.  When I got the 30in waist for these pants it was far to tight.  I had to size up to a 32"" waist which fit perfectly, like my usual 30"" size normally feels.  I would recommend sizing up.  I had to return my initial pair and reorder the size up.<br /><br />Durability and comfort of these pants is amazing.  I can move around freely and comfortably but these are still heavy enough to provide some warmth in the winter and stay cool enough in the summer.  I love the gusseted crotch and use the side thigh pocket for my phone.  My iPhone 11 fits in the side pocket.  Have worn these for a year and they still look brand new.  I can't recommend them enough.  I was nervous buying them because I don't normally spend more than $30 on pants but these were definitely worth the investment.  I wear this same pair about 3 days every week.",1

5,"I purchased this for my spouse, who was taking an extended trip abroad. I was a bit disappointed when it arrived, as I had thought the price (around $33, shipping included) was a steal, but hadn't realized it was not as seemingly substantial as the other brand duffles we had seen in retail outlets at $65-$100. It does not have a hard base, for example, but is rather more like a large backpack, albeit shaped differently. He was happy, however, with the lifetime warranty and with the fact that, essentially crushable, the empty duffle will fit inside nearly any other reasonably sized piece of luggage and can therefore be so packed to be later used as a standalone laundry bag, which was his intended use for it. Another nice characteristic is that it is very lightweight for something so strong and roomy and thus does not add unnecessary weight, further burdening the traveler toting multiple bags through the airport. And without cardboard, vinyl, foam, or any other reinforcement that might be damaged by water or take a long time to dry, it would appear easily washable. It looked brand new after returning from the long trip, and we have every expectation that it will be as durable as his Jansport carry-on rolling suitcase, which has lasted longer than any other piece of luggage we've had, despite years of frequent flying. It's definitely a keeper.",1
5,"My first pair of Rovos gloves lasted at least 2 seasons. The padding held up well. There was some stretch, but not too much. I only bought another pair since I lost one of the gloves.

I was disappointed that the color did not match the online depiction, instead of a vibrant green it was a very light shade of flourescent green. I would recommend these gloves, but not this color.",1

4,The color was a little off. Not the correct shade of blue. The picture online doesn’t accurately depict the color. The skirt was knee length so we had to have it hemmed.

3,"I have another pair of Tanming wide-legged pants in another fabric and style that I adore, but that are just a tiny bit snug in my regular size (L). I expected these to fit similarly as they are a similar cut, so I ordered a size up (XL) so they would have a bit more ease at the hip (I'm an hourglass shape, 5'6"", 185 lbs, normally size 12/14). These were TINY. I could get them zipped due to the fabric, but they pulled atrociously across the hips, gaped at the pockets, and gave me the dreaded camel-toe fit at the crotch.<br />The plus is that the caramel-color was a bit on the rust-side (you can see that the coloring of the stock photo has been adjusted to make them appear less orange-y) but I took a chance since I was looking for a rusty orange anyway and they met my expectations. Definitely less brown and more orange, though still in-between. I want to love them, but I will honestly have to drop a pant-size to be able to wear them. I was unable to return for a larger size, since I ordered the largest size they had available. I kept because of the very affordable cost and because I am working hard to get in shape. Hopefully I will fit them later in the season.",0

5,"Recently I had a couple of friends of a friend stay at my place and little did I know the hell I was about endure. Let me clear this up, I am a CLEAN FREAK, I take at least 2 showers a day, so this was devastating to me. I went to the doctor, got my prescription cream and was really dissapointed with the results after 3 or 4 days because I was only supposed to use the cream for a week, but in 3 or 4 days it maybe got 5% better. I researched online and found that tea tree oil was good at killing and healing ring worm. So when I went with my mom to the local Ross dress for less, I saw this stuff and decided to give it a try. I'm not joking when I say the day after I first used it, it was about 50% better than the day before, I couldn't believe the results! I also use it on my hair and my hair is so soft now! I'm at day 9 now and when using this wash in conjunction with equate brand jock itch cream (it has all the same ingredients as the prescription one that I ran out of for ring worm for $5 less, check the box) I would say it's about 75 to 80% gone and getting better everyday! I know that they don't make it anymore, but if you're just looking for reviews because you stumbled upon this like I did, DO NOT HESITATE. This wash was a blessing from Jesus himself!",1

4,"I have a hard time finding watches that are small enough for my wrist. Those with metal bands always need to have links removed, so can't buy them online.  I searched for a long time to find a leather band and a small enough face for my frame.  I settled on the blue band with the white face, and it has seven holes, so the band can get quite small.  The watch face is larger than what I would like for a dress watch, but for an every day time piece, this is quite nice looking.  The blue band goes quite well with both blues and greens as it is kind of a mixed color. I have only had it for a couple of months, but so far it runs great.  It is a good, basic, no frills watch for seniors like me, and kids that don't need or want all the frills of an expensive watch.",1

3,"So, where do I begin; I don't often write reviews right away when I don't feel their is a need for it specially when getting the item a day after, but I needed to write this review as I have mixed feelings with this watch. So the BullToro Watch 0001 is definitely a looker, it actually looks great, now let me tell you something, that's where the WOW factor and COOL looking watch ends. I know this watch only cost 80 dollars 86 with tax etc.....however I was expecting a high quality watch that would feel natural and sturdy on the hand, something with a little weight on it that I know will last me a long time. I was wrong, Although the watch is pretty big roughly 60mm big the actual watch itself not counting the entire bezel itself is roughly around maybe 30mm big as you can see in the pictures below it. So why the 3 stars if it looks great, well as I mention earlier that's where the WOW and COOL factor ends. The watch is pretty much made out of poly-carbonate core if that's what they want to call it, I call it plastic, plastic is still plastic no matter how high quality it is. Yes I said it, its plastic, everything except the top and bottom which is covered is made of plastic up until the band is connected to it, it only is being covered by 2 thin maybe 2mm layers of stainless steel top and bottom. Now lets talk about the band itself, the band is made of the same material that the watch is made off, the black tips holding the watch are made of plastic up until you reach the bottom portions of the watch to wrap on your hand are made of high grade rubber. The stainless steel bands are not high quality, or at-least they do not look high quality as its pretty much hollow on the inside of the steel bands. The presentation of the box and the accessories that came with it, is of no importance to me, there presentation is decent, that doesn't make me drop points, however the watch does. Now on the amazon page it says that the glass on the watch is made of high grade mineral glass. I don't believe that is made of mineral glass because mineral does not scratch that easily when cleaning the glass or the stainless steel with a high grade micro-fiber cloth, you can't see the small scratches it left on the pictures but they are there, If I'm not mistaken this looks like acrylic crystal and not mineral crystal, which is made of manufactured plastic so someone is lying on this page. Maybe its me that I've gotten so use-to owning high end quality made stainless steel watches that they feel big, heavy, and sturdy they don't feel like they will break just by moving my hand really fast, maybe if they would of also done the same with this watch I wouldn't have this mix feelings, I'm torn from wanting to return this watch and getting my money back or keeping it just for the look.<br /><br />Here is my unbiased final thoughts, What do I think of this watch, its great looking but not a keeper unless you are into the WOW and COOL Factor. If they would of made the entire watch stainless steel I would of been very impressed, maybe up the price to 150 or 200 dollars, I would of still bought the watch because I like quality watches that feel sturdy and high grade. They did right on the design, the design is great if not amazing, but the quality control of the watch is horrible. If the sellers are reading this I hope they learn from this because people want quality watches not watches that looks like a high priced toy looking watch, and fire the guy that had the bright idea of making a plastic watch. Yes this watch looks like a really expensive toy to me. Do I think this watch is worth 80 dollars, NO I definitely do not think this watch is worth 80, if not that, I think it's worth at-least 50 dollars if not less. I will give my second final thoughts in a week or 2 as I mention earlier that I have mixed Feelings on whether I want to keep the watch or return it back and get my money back and spend the extra 100 dollars on a high grade watch that is all stainless steel.<br /><br />UPDATE AS OF 08/22/2016<br />Alright so it has been little over a week since I reviewed this watch, and I have finally concluded my final thoughts about the Bulltoro watch. Although I still feel strongly about my feelings on the quality control of this watch, the COOL factor and WOW looking watch factor won me over from the quality control. Yes this watch is pretty cool looking and honestly although it is made of polycarbonate plastic and feels like a really expensive toy, I've grown to like it and if you want to try this watch out for the cool factor I'd recommend buying it, the pictures are proof of how the watch looks on your hand, I'm average size that has a 7.7 wrist and it fits perfectly. I still think the watch is still high price for the quality control thus I will keep it at 3 stars because of the quality control and the glass either being really cheap mineral glass or being acrylic glass after cleaning the glass and noticing a few scratches when cleaning it with a high quality micro fiber cloth. Also if you like the attention that alot of people specially girls will give you then this is for you.",0
5,this shirt is one of my favorite,1
4,Comfortable.,1
3,"Cute pattern, nice fabric; however the bulkiness where the headband is sewn is very thick and causes my hair to stick out oddly in the back. Also, the headband slides up my head so every hour or so I have to take it off and put it on where it feels comfortable.",0
2,"This beautiful print dress that is very inexpensive. However, it arrived with wrinkles that were very difficult to remove. I washed it then pressed hard with a warm iron to smooth the soft beige floral fabric. I ordered an XL since I am 5' 11 1/2"" tall and weigh 170 lbs, usually a size 14 misses fits well. The bodice is only 14"" long (measured from the middle of the neckline, unfortunately rests 3"" above my natural waist. See my profile photo, my hand is on my waist. The short bodice results in my waist appearing larger than it actually is. If I had tried it on in a store I would NOT have purchased it. However, by wearing a 24"" petticoat under the 26"" skirt results in an acceptable look so I am keeping it. The fabric is thin, so a full white slip in additional to the petticoat enhances the appearance of the dress.",0
5,The earrings are great.  They feel great on my ears no pinching or rashes<br />could you possibly make your earrings larger would purchase more,1

4,I went a size up in the pink. I’m 5’2 120 and had to get a medium. So I got a medium in pink and gave the size small black to my lil cuzin who is bout 5’5 and lil skinner.

4,"They are fantastic for the price. They are lightweight, and a little oversized. I have a narrower face, specifically, 6'3 and 240lbs.<br />They look and feel well built, again, better than anything you will find for that price or even double.<br /><br />They are actually polarized unlike most others at this price point who claim to be so.<br /><br />You can tell when you look through a tinted window and its purple and has lines everywhere.<br /><br />Worth every penny, and cheap enough to have multiple styles and colors.<br /><br />well done.",1

3,"I had some old salwars that were wearing out, so I took a chance to order these in bright pink, navy, and black. The colors are perfect, the stitching and finishing are professional, but the size guide is a very generous one. I am not one to just ""buy my normal size,"" and I do rigorously check the actual garment measurements with size charts provided for every online purchase I make, so I was surprised to find that this did NOT fit - far too tight around the waist for me, despite getting 2 sizes larger than I would normally purchase. Moreover, unfortunately at 5'7"" these ended up being shorter than I had expected. I will be keeping them and hoping to lose weight... If you are shorter than me and get the right size, you will be VERY pleased with the quality of the fabric, the sewing and finishing.",0
5,The hat is good for 35 degrees or lower it get hot above 35 degrees,1
3,"You get what you pay for. Bought to wear to wedding. So cheaply made, the necklace broke in half taking it off after the wedding. Had to through it out.",0
3,"For the price these glasses are cute. The downside is that you can see a raised line in the middle of the glasses, right where they sit on your nose.",0
3,I like the top but it is skin tight!  I wont be able to wear this top.,0
5,Awsome.  Fast shipping.,1
5,Super comfy pants. I take piyo and I haven’t tried these in class. I just imagine that they are too big and flowy for an active class. But I think they would be nice for a slow flow or vinyasa yoga. I was told on multiple occasions that I look like jasmine from Aladdin which is why I’m awarding these pants with five stars.,1
4,"I bought this bracelet as a gift and my friend loved it! It was a little snug at first, but stretched some with wear.",1
5,This is a super soft and comfy shirt. It is as shown in the picture. The color and the length are as shown. Love it!!,1
5,We love to see some casual cosplay!,1
5,Love this.  Also ordered matching ring and earrings. Looks great with bronze metal.,1
3,"they are ok, but you can see threw them. I don't like that very much",0
5,I always use Collonil Leather Gel or cream for my handbags and shoes.  Works wonderful.  Recommend Collonil Water Spray also.,1
2,I thought this dress looked so cute and was excited to get it... Boy was I disappointed! The rose is sewn on and there is a black netting that just doesn't look right. Before I tried it on I thought maybe I could remove the netting but they stitched across it so the thread would have shown badly against the white of the skirt. I got my normal size an XL &amp; I tried to try the dress on I was a bit shocked that the arm holes are just way to small to fit over my upper arm. I have never had this problem before with a dress. Usually they don't fit me in the bust because I am a little bigger then some girls (38DDD). I didn't even get to zip the dress up. The dress was well made and I am sure if it fit correctly it would loo nice and even though I didn't like the black netting I would have kept it.,0
5,Good quality and great price!,1
5,Looked really cute! Just as pictured. Baby was super happy with all the bright colors and the tulle.,1
1,Cute but gems started to fall off after 2 days of wear!! Disappointed.,0
4,"This dress caught my eye as comfortable & stylish for a wedding reception - I prefer to hide my arms and show my legs - so this was the perfect find!!<br />At 5'4&#34; & 124lbs - I have a small butt & sz B bra, broad shoulders and no defined waistline with slightly thicker middle, so I bought size Lg and it fits well in all areas (not tight & not loose) and is comfortable.  I normally avoid the higher neckline but it works on this dress. Will need a strapless bra as the open back shows the bra straps.  Overall I am very satisfied with this dress!!",1
4,I would give it a 5 because it was super cute but it came with a button already popped off thankfully it was the second button down a scar can make due but a little disappointed because we don’t have time to return it for the event that she is wearing it to .,1
5,Great compression with no loss of shape yet. Highly recommend to nurses,1
1,The earrings were broken. So very disappointed,0
1,The product took a long to arrive. The package was intact without any sign of damage.<br />The frame seems to be made of cheap plastic. The whole eyeglass is very light and feels fragile. The adjustment does not work well. I am surprisingly disappointed. It is quite puzzling and suspicious to me why so many flattering positive ratings of a product of such quality. I'll return it and ask for a refund.,0
5,Very pleased with the item. Thank you. C. Carroll,1
5,Fit well,1
4,Is very beautiful and love the Scriptures is a especial unique piece for my prayers i love it thanks you,1
5,"I was looking for a little something in the way of a chock-er type necklace. This is a great little touch of ""gold"" at the neck line for those blouses and tops when you don't want a real showy piece; this is just right for those times.",1
1,"It looks like something kinda cool, the whole carbon graphite look. However......it is only a cheap little sticker in there. Mine was half peeled off when I got it. So instead of looking suave and debonaire I could easily be sitting, talking to a corporate exec and have him or her mention my sticker is coming off my cufflink.<br /><br />Not cool. Completely cheesy and cheap. The link is sturdy but gluing a sticker....a picture of a chunk of carbon fiber.....REALLY?!?!?!?!",0
1,The worst quality I’ve seen even for costume jewelry. I was not expecting top quality but this item looks painted in a gold finish. It’s very very yellow and not something I would wear. Does not look like picture.,0
4,"Not for an adult.<br />I love the quality and the loon !<br />The only problem is that is to small For  my husband hand  , I just going to give to my son<br />He is 14 so it will fith fine.<br />I wish they have other sizes :(",1
5,battery didn't last long,1
1,"This hat is hardly big enough to fit a small child.  It is extremely small.  It is NOT “one size fits all”.  Unless you buy this for a child, it’s not your size.  we can’t return it and have no use for it now.  Waste of money.",0
3,ya get what ya pay for....but they are cute......,0
5,"These are some of the best leggings I've ever bought. I wear my leggings up to my belly button and these sit there pretty well. Don't get me wrong, I have to adjust them sometimes, but no where near as often as other leggings. They're very comfortable too. I am five months postpartum and a size 14 but usually a 12 and XL fits perfect.",1
1,"This is by no means a chiffon style. The fabric is rough, itchy, heavy and just overall weird.",0
3,a little long but works just the same,0
1,Scratches way too easily. It would be ideal for anyone who doesn't have metal keys. ??,0
5,A lot of room in purse!  Nice quality!,1
3,Nice shirt. But way to small,0
5,Great quality and great looking !!!!! :-D,1
2,"I wish that this bracelet was as pretty in person as it is online.  I was very disappointed.  First of all, there are eight bangles and thank goodness because I was able to use six of them.  The two bangles with stones in them are terrible.  The wider bangle lost a stone immediately and the narrower bangle with stones was poorly put together with the stone settings crooked.  They are also pretty large so they would not work for smaller wrists.",0
1,I've used toilet paper thicker than this dress. I would never buy again. I will only wear this around the house and never outside. Don't waste your money!,0
5,"Excellent headphones for kids! Bought these for my 7 year old son, who has a rather large head and they fit great. He is sensitive to noise, and is in a large multiage classroom, so I bought these for him to wear to help him concentrate on his work. He loves wearing them and says they are comfortable and he can still hear the teacher speak to him if she is at his desk.",1
5,Wear these when I'm snowboarding and I love them helps protect my bum when I do fall. It’s been a few years now and after practice I haven’t used it but I gave them to my wife to use and she’s been falling without any injuries so far!,1
5,Paid .79 liked it,1
4,"The earrings are exactly what I paid for, not the best quality but it’s still nice. I will keep it.",1
4,BELLS WERE ALITTLE SMALLER THEN I THOUGHT BY THE PICTURE...BUT SERVED THEIR PURPOSE FOR MY COSTUME.,1
1,Doesn’t work worth a poo.,0
5,These fit true to size.  Very comfortable. Would recommend.,1
5,Perfect for my X-Men belt,1
4,It’s a very nice watch but too heavy and bulky for my likings.,1
2,Horrible quality.,0
2,"At first sight, the design looks nice, however that's where the pros end.<br />Cons:<br /> - the socks run very small, even for my tiny little girl<br /> - there is nothing deluxe about these socks; after just one wash they look worn out, very cheap.<br />After giving one pair to my little girl to wear once and seeing how small they are I wanted to return them, but washed that pair before sending them back. Giving how old that pair looks now (as if it has been worn for years and through countless washes), I cannot return it in good faith.<br />Definitely very low quality socks.",0
1,"Really big and the material is really thin and weird, really uncomfortable and not what I was expecting at ALL. It’s big and baggy in all the wrong places.",0
5,"I have to say I was skeptical about the fit. Actually when it arrived, I was a bit surprised. I am 6’ 230lbs with big hands therefore the sleeve ends was tight at first. The color, overall fit and 3 pockets on the back PERFECT. Listen for the price whether you ride a bike or walk the trails. This is a good purchase.",1
3,Really love the earrings and the size. One doesn’t want to stay attached to the front post so keep losing the back piece which is disappointing,0
3,"I liked the look of this watch, but was surprised when I opened it -- I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the dimensions in the description, because this watch is sized more like a man's watch than a women's.  The case is almost 2 inches wide.  Not what I wanted at all, so I'm sending it back.",0
1,Fall apart minutes before my wedding.,0
2,"The material is soft and silky, but the way it hangs is not flattering. I wear XL in most tops that are not “petite”.<br />It’s that silky material that feels great, but shows every lump you may have. I’m sure it looks great like the picture on someone thin.",0
5,Love it will buy other colors.  Perfect hemline and I’m 5’8”.,1
1,So stiff.  Very very stiff.<br />No way would I try and wear.,0
1,"Loved the shoe it’s self. But way to narrow, go a whole size up and have very narrow feet if you want them to fit",0
5,Great dress. Extremely comfortable. Also very versatile you can dress it up easily for any occasion but it's also comfortable enough to wear around the house.,1
4,Very little difference with or without the glasses for night driving.  They are well made and fit well over my regular glasses.,1
5,Calidad nike,1
1,The silver tarnished in one day,0
3,"I'm 5-8, 160 pounds. There is a seam at the waist, but the seam is several inches above my waist (and about 2 inches below my bust). The sleeve length is good for my long arms. I'm disappointed about the waist seam not being in the right place.",0
3,Beautiful dress unfortunately the white is completely see through so I had to return it,0
4,"Nice, but runs small.",1
1,Not even two days after having it and the rhinestones are already gone,0
1,"This sandal looks great but did not hold up. Velcro on both pair I bought tore off during third ware. I expected these to last three months, instead they lasted three days. I returned them and went with a more expensive brand. Guess you get what you pay for.",0
5,As expected.,1
5,I love this dress. I bought the yellow! The fabric is awesome! And it fits perfectly! Going to get another one in different color.,1
3,My son only got to wear these four times. He never complained.,0
5,Very sleek and nice. It came in a box as well as a bag including a cleansing cloth and a card to test the polarization. I am very pleased.,1
3,Waste is really small even with the 2x and the material  is so cheap doesnt look the same as the picture  but it is cute id wear it since inalready bought it but wouldnt buy again. I brought the camo green outfit and also the leopard one.,0
5,My toddler loves these. He gets excited each time he wears them.,1
1,Poor quality,0
2,Strong smell of chemicals! Looks ver cheap! Probably will donate to goodwill,0
5,Great boots for wide feet I'm an 11 and these fit great enough room all around. Will buy again in the future. I wear them indoors for work.,1
4,Purchased for my 13 yr old granddaughter. It was a little large for her. She enjoyed the emojis and wears it when on their boat.,1
1,"They come from China so I’m not sure where”Nappa” comes from.  And they are tiny, almost the size of a child’s hand even though I ordered and they were marked large.",0
4,Comfy and material is soft. I am 5'4 200lbs and got a xl.,1
5,GORGEOUS and so much prettier than described! worth the price!,1
5,I like the ankle strap,1
5,Got these for 12 boys for a homecoming powder puff dance..great price for something worn for 30 seconds of the dance.  I totally worried that they would destroy them putting them on and off so fast..not one was even close to being torn!,1
1,NO COMFORT TO THE THICKNESS... PAINFUL ..  NOT DOUBLE LINED EITHER.,0
5,Good,1
1,So damn short. I mean the slit shows my bits... Ordered a size up. Very disappointed,0
5,Looks great in women too,1
5,The hat was easy to wear and it shaded my face from the sun very well.,1
5,"Lightweight, durable - my second order, holds up after several washes. Shipping Slow, I wear a 9.5 US shoe size - may be to tight on a size 10 or larger.",1
5,"Sweet bag, only wish it had a couple addl interior pockets",1
2,"i got the rainbow colored one but it is basically just yellow and orange. the edges aren't quite finished, so be careful as it may catch on things.",0
5,"It’s made of high quality material. The leather straps & trim look very nice. They have a good number of big, highly functional pockets. I figured it would be nice to wear as an apron in the kitchen, too, so I got 2.",1
5,Apple Watch,1
3,Cute but shorter than I like. It just wasn't long enough.,0
1,"These are not XL size sunglasses, but small glasses with straight arms so they can fit tightly on big heads.<br />Found them also at a local store for $2!",0
4,"I wasn't expecting much with this shirt. It's fairly well made and very cute. The only negative is that it is pretty wide, but the style of the shirt may allow for that depending on body type.  I wish it was a little bit more form fitting.",1
5,I LOVE THIS PURSE! I can fit everything I needed to carry in this bag! It's light weight so it's not heavy when filled. The construction and materials are excellent. I will purchase at least 3 more colors!,1
2,They are HUGE! and heavy...I will try to give them away.,0
2,"The design is nice, but the playing of the metal is very sloppy, not smooth. They just don’t have the shine I was expecting",0
5,For my wife,1
2,Fabric is too thin.  Almost like sheer.  I ordered the Beige color and it was true to color.  I orderededium and It fits everywhere else except the arms.  The fitting around my arms is too tight.  But then maybe I have have big arms as I lift weights. But they're not mascular at all.  Either way I wished it was stretchable. I'm returning it.,0
1,The dress I bought pattern looks nothing like the picture shown. It was a little too big and I hate the material..... My boyfriend said it looks like a shower curtain,0
3,"The sweater is ok, looks nice from the distance but in close inspection doesn’t seems so high quality, looks a bit so-so  about the cloth. The inside is warm but looks a bit cheap. Not bad in general, I use it for very casual outfits.",0
5,great material. i use Tide laundry detergent. the color is hold very well.,1
1,The material on this outfit is horrible. Very cheap looking. I returned the outfit,0
4,Love it.,1
2,"Tried wearing it and got a headache within a few minutes because it was way too tight. My five-year old son liked it so I gave it to him but he even took it off saying it was too tight. No idea who they made the headband for, it is not wearable.",0
4,It looks nice.,1
4,"Light,  good  customer service",1
3,"I ordered this expecting to have a black top and pink shorts with black lace detail, but they gave me a black top with black shorts. The top is super cute, the bottoms were a strange rough fabric, very uncomfortable against my skin. I returned it.",0
3,I love these but the post are too large to fit my hole. I compared to my other earring (included in picture) and the are really large.i can get one of the gold one's in but that's it.,0
3,It looks really cheap like a vinyl iron on And the extra large fit to small,0
5,Works as advertised!,1
1,very small for XL.,0
1,Fit small and so breathable Don’t think much protection. Maybe great for people that want to look like they are wearing a mask and have difficulty breathing through disposables. The really are small and super stretchy but still don’t fit well,0
5,"I would have worn these from age 4 to the grave had they been available. Knee-high skirt with reinforced but gentle waistline; length somehow falls about the same on everyone - just past the knee in the 60's student vibe for shorties 5'3"" and under; above you might get at or above knee for a little suggestion of skin.  But the skort means that you can run, play, move around without fear of impropriety. Nobody will see your knickers, now you can go actually move without concern",1
5,"All three are well made, well packed; I used red one to tight up my long sweater which doesn’t have any buttons, it holds the sweater very stable, very happy I don’t have to pin any more",1
3,They don't seem as tight as other compression socks I have tried,0
5,Love this dress! It's the perfect length and looks great when paired with a belt,1
3,"Soft and breathable. I love the color and the material is spot on. However, I'm 5'5 150 and I wear smalls or mediums. This medium was huge... I had to send it back. I may need an XS. But I so love the material. Will try again depending on color and size options.",0
5,"I went ahead and orderd these in the 18-24  month size, despite some negative comments.  We wore the 12-18 month size in this style a ton and we wanted the next size larger, since they were outgrown.  These shoes arrived cute as ever and maybe a bit wide or large if you have a child with tiny narrow feet.  My son has a wider foot and instep, so these were perfect, no squished feet or ankles and room to grow, but not so large that we couldn't wear them.  So, I am very happy with these shoes and glad I took a chance and ordered them!",1
5,"I wanted a fabric band to replace the silicone band that comes standard on the Garmin Instinct. The silicone band was ok, but I wanted something more comfortable. I did a search to find a replacement, but there were not many options. To be honest, I was looking for something wider than CD2 JOY band, but thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. It's very comfortable, easily adjustable, and seems to be very well made. I'm in my early 50's and have never worn a watch just because they've been uncomfortable for me to wear. This band helped change that. In fact, I like it so much that I just ordered another one in a different color.",1
1,"The center stone fell out after a month. Upon returning the item in hopes of buying another, I was only given a partial refund despite the ring having ""In the (very) unlikely event that you aren’t satisfied, simply return for a 100% refund."" in the description.",0
5,I love it  even though I haven't received my order. thank u,1
5,Bought the wrong size and ended up sizing up so I could wear them because they were so cool. They are heavy and they fall out often but I just love them.,1
3,"Can't really move your arms up, the way it is sewn it makes you move stiff. Also, I wear a size 4,  it runs very small and so I had to give it to my daughter. Cute, but its worth about $9.99 for a one time wear for a teen.",0
1,"A hole ripped in the bag where the leash hooks onto it the first night that I used it. My son fell down and it just ripped. It is very cut, though.",0
5,Fast dependable shipping,1
5,"These panties are really comfortable. Also, lines are not visible when wore under a tight fitting workout clothes. I love it! I had bought 6, but am considering of buying even more :)",1
5,Great material! So comfortable.  This will be perfect for travel.,1
4,Leather is much stiffer than I expected. Maybe it will break in and get softer. Pockets have lots of room. Top carry loop is much larger than it needs to be.,1
5,Are nice for any body,1
5,It's perfect for a black top,1
5,Great quality. Durable and perfect for traveling. I got these is grey and i’ll be buying another set to replace another cheaper brand I bought.,1
5,So flowy and soft!,1
5,Bought to hold up chainsaw for neighbors.,1
1,This shirt description says T-shirt but it is not and it looks nothing like the picture. The washed look around the sleeve and neck is not there. This is not the shirt advertised.,0
1,This shirt is completely see through. It looks dark gray but it’s black very loose stitching making it see through.,0
5,I saw my watch in the store and loved it. Then I realized I needed a  chain for it. I saw this one and knew it was a perfect accent to the watch. A great choice.,1
1,the sleeves are too loose,0
5,I bought this as a surprise for my hubby. We will see how he reacts ;),1
1,These pants looked nice but fit strangely. The back was too short..Almost as if they were made backwards....As front came up above the waist.,0
5,The shorts are comfortable.,1
5,"Bought for easy entry into a theme park. Never been through bag check so quickly. Very durable too, even through a light rain storm",1
4,Two thumbs up!!! Loved the earrings. It gives you personality. 😊,1
2,Not good for large glasses,0
4,nice,1
5,"Beautiful Anuschka Key Chain, bought two.",1
5,"This is a gorgeous and fantastic purse which I use all of the time. It is sturdy and worth much more than the price which Amazon charged. It has plenty of room inside, with compartments, and good pockets, and is patent leather. I have received tons and tons of compliments, everybody I know wants one, and even people on the street! Looks exactly as photos, and is exactly as described. Well packaged.",1
3,one glove shorter and smaller than the other. Could not use,0

4,It looks great but not high quality - strap will sometimes just open,1
3,I got better results using my fingers to add the charms,0
5,My granddaughter loved them,1
5,"I'm writing this review to let you know that this belt is a jewel. I didn't expect much when I ordered it... it was just time for a new belt. When I recieved it the quality was great,the look is on point, and it has a lock on the belt. For me, the lock is a great feature. No more belt loosening up and you have to fix your pants and re-adjust your belt. It's an all purpose belt cause you can wear it with anything and still feel great about it. Believe me this purchase you will feel great about.",1
1,"I just don’t have words for these, other than extremely cheaply made with fabric quality not even close to looking like suede?  They fit small and are uncomfortable.  That cushy stuff they have, would break down in less than a day, I can tell.  Then there’s that variegated color palette- it doesn’t mean this, people!  They are uncomfortable and do run small- order up, if you must. Personally, I’m sending these back and will look for a real suede pair that’s comfortable.",0
2,Not as pictured. Was green with brown stars. Didn't even bother trying on. It is going back.,0
5,"fits well, super comfortable...love it",1
1,"The instruction sheet that comes with the watchband states that it should NOT be worn for exercise or sleeping!  Therefore, the band is USELESS for the Fitbit Fitness tracker!!!!  The fitness tracker is supposed to be worn while exercising and while sleeping.  Also, the only cleaning method is with a dry cloth.  No water, no other cleaner.  The band can tarnish.  There is also a warning that the metal may cause an allergic reaction.  It appears that the ""stainless steel"" band has a coating that can cause allergies, as well as, tarnish.",0
5,Love it,1
5,Quality,1
4,"they like it , they have one for each kid  something from AFRICA  they ask me for  so I got it for the kids men and women like it too i  have to order some for them too now.",1
1,Too flimsy,0
4,"Love the detail on the back, but structure wise in the front its lacking.. Fits odd..",1
5,Loved it looked awesome at baby shower,1
4,"great quality, took some time to put together",1
4,"It's adorable, but I don' know what 2T would be able to fit into it. It's pretty large.",1
5,"The first thing that struck me was the minimal packaging; wallet wrapped in tissue paper inside of a recycled cardboard folding box. Nice to see a company reduce waste with as little packaging as possible.<br />Now the wallet... WOW! Very, very nice material and build. I'm sure this will last for a long time, without a doubt. Stitches are study and even, leather is of sufficient grade and my stuff fit inside without issue. I have 6 cards and cash inside and its still slim enough to comfortably fit in my front pocket with ease. If I could rate it higher, I would! Great product!",1
3,You get what you pay for and maybe it's just me but it feels weird around the chest and shoulders even though it is the same size as my other rashguards. I use it as an emergency rashguard if I forget one or just haven't done the laundry yet.,0
5,The band is very comfortable. Have received many awesome compliments. I love it. Gave one to my granddaughter. She was trilled. Go BUCKS,1
5,Love love love this bracelet. Very well made and it matches my motorcycle colors too. Ride'n in style........beautiful bracelet!,1
3,"Not as described. It's solid black, does not have the pink centers. Quality is just ok",0
2,Colors in all these shirts is much darker than pictured.  I have purchased more than just one and all are very dark.  Maybe 5 shades darker than shown.,0
4,Really nice tie for the money.,1
3,"This is a cute cardigan. It's super long, which I love, though on the thinner side. It's great for those slightly cool, but not freezing days. I wear cardigans a great deal, especially around my house, and I like that this one could have given me the option of having a longer one for when I want some extra warmth on my legs. (I'm 5'5"" and it comes past my knees.) That said, I'm disappointed that it's so itchy and irritating. I've tried washing it, hoping that it would soften up, but I've not had luck with that so far. It's so bad that I'm not able to wear it. As far as sizing goes, I most often go with a size large and prefer a loose fit. This size large is so loose, I think a medium might have worked better.",0
1,They are completely useless,0
1,Very cheaply made.. nothing like the picture.. disappointed,0
3,"The scarf is on the thin side; which isn't bad, since it often isn't all that cold in October and March.<br />It is nice and long, which is good for when I use it as an emergency face covering.<br />Had to remove the house crest (Slytherin) because it was soo stiff. It is like putting a weight on one end.",0
1,Very cheap looking. Not what I was hoping for.,0
2,Cheap and hideous.,0
3,"Fit too tight in the under arm, chest area.<br />Returned",0
5,"A little shorter than the girlfriend expected, but I'm a fan",1
1,Terrible sizing,0
1,They misspelled the name. It took over a month to be delivered and the headband had no stretch to it. My daughter bought this for a teammate as a birthday gift and it wouldn't stretch enough to go around her head. The girl is 9!,0
5,Runs big.,1
2,Not good. Peel at first used.,0
5,"Wonderful fit comfy soft. Im usually a size 8, 34D, 5'5&#34;, perfect red color as well! Buttons arent irritating, kinda feels like a fancy bathing suit but doesnt look like one and can wear with anything!",1
4,Print looks good. Bright colors.,1
2,"I absolutely love Rekucci pants, and have another pair of their pull on “jeans”, but this pair didn’t even slightly fit- no stretch to get them over my hips! I ordered my normal size. But I fear even a size up or 2 would not  have enough stretch to fit properly. So disappointed.",0
3,"This dress is nice, but it is a tad big. I am 5'3, 125lbs, and 30F. I ordered a Small.",0
5,Beautiful pendant very happy,1
2,"I ordered a medium and it's way too small. Sleeves really squeezes my arms and I have very thin arms. They are charging me $12.00 to return. I get it, it's not Prime, but dang! $12.00!!!!",0
5,Pretty,1
3,"Manga muy estrecha de la blusa , soy M y me tocó Xl y aún sigue estrecha",0
2,Too masculine looking. Looks like my Grandpa’s case. It will be returned.,0
4,Ordered this for my daughter's royal court for her 18th Birthday Debut party.  She wanted a dress that would flow nicely while they are dancing.  Fit perfectly and price didn't break our budget!  Although the fabric is really thin and will require the ladies to use a chemise or a slip under the dress.,1
2,Loved the band! It was so pretty but the clasp kept coming undone. It finally happened and I lost my smart watch. Had my watch on my wrist then I didn't. So sad 😞. Was in disneyland on thunder mountain railroad and<br /> I lifted my hand up and soon after we smelled burning and the ride stopped. After the ride I had no watch. I put two and two together.,0
5,Very comfortable and relaxing,1
1,Cute but item arrived with one post unglued and the other post totally bent.,0
2,"Only  reason this is 2 stars is that one of the elephants came off and I had to JB Weld it. Other than that, great fit and looks good.",0
4,Wish it fit better!  Love the feel and color!!!!!,1
5,Amazing,1
5,"Perfect, love it. I have in black and ordering blue also!! Size small 5'2 113lbs 35-25-35 curvy and very fit. Extremely flattering",1
1,"Looks super cute, terrible quality. Day 2 and the wires are bending and plastic is ripping. Plastic is essentially the same thickness as a sandwich bag. So disappointing.",0
1,I’ve only worn this a few times and the plating is already coming off. It’s starting to change color,0
2,Too small didn’t like material,0
5,nice,1
5,My sister loved it.  It was a gift for her birthday.  Very feminine,1
5,"very good watch, easy to read with a sleek style. The slender watch band makes the large face not tood large.",1
4,"My daughter saw these glasses online and had to have them. They come well-packaged as you can see in the attached photos and include a lens cleaning cloth.<br /><br />There is one pair of women's glasses and one pair of men's glasses included in the package. The glasses are for someone with a bigger head than ours. The fit for us was just okay. The style is kind of retro and they do a good job of keeping the sun out of your eyes. My daughter and I tried them out on a road trip to NYC.<br /><br />I recommend trying to get them while on sale. Even so, full-price is $10 per pair of sunglasses - that is reasonable.",1
1,Muy pequeños,0
1,I was going to use this for my daughters first birthday party. However it looks like this was previously worn and another baby spit up on it.,0
5,Great product,1
5,"Me encantaronn,,,diferentes, hermososs,lindosss colores,,,como muestran en la foto!!",1
1,"After reading the reviews on how this has been too small for others, I ordered a size up just in case. Even so, this thing still wouldn't fit over my head! Pictures a knee brace. Actually, I think a knee brace is bigger! I really wanted this to work but nope. And not worth the time or trouble to send back so I just threw it out. Do not bother!",0
1,Had it for one day.<br />The metal bar that holds it to the watch itself already broke....<br />I do not recommend.,0
3,"I like these sunglasses in that they do provide shielding from sunlight for the eyes, but have issues with their hard shaped plastic design. The only thing lacking is that they arrived in a clear plastic bag and thus, have no case for protection against scratches that are inevitable with everyday use. They work well with providing adequate protection against having to squint in bright sunlight. They are extremely rigid however, and offer no pliability so even putting them in a shirt pocket can be somewhat uncomfortable in that there is no &#34;give&#34; in their shape. They are constructed of plastic. I was offered these glasses in exchange for my honest review and opinion. I have given both here and I would have to say that you could purchase a pair that is comparable at a local dollar store.",0
5,"It great and comfortable but it does fit a little on the large side, I would recommend getting one size smaller than recommended on the size chart!!!!",1
3,"Ar first glance the bands look great. Very difficult to remove band to change out.<br />I ordered 1 black and white and the red and black bands as a pair.<br />The orange and black band is far from red which I received.<br />Bands are comfortable, just not what I ordered.<br />Oh well, you win some you lose some.",0
5,Very nice,1
2,The chain and pendant are not as shown. Chain is very very thin and so is the pendant,0
1,It is very non stretch and the 2x is more like a medium. It was waaayyyy too short and definitely not as imagined. I can't even take a picture of this. Let me go to UPS to return this lolol,0
5,Love this necklace! I wear it almost every day!,1
5,"These shocks feel amazing! Compression in just the right spots, very durable! Only downside difficult to put on but that's to be expected and will probably be easier with regular use. I love these they give my legs a nice hug and make my feet and legs feel amazing and almost pain free all day. Highly recommended!",1
5,Have to girlfriend and she loves it!,1
1,Mala calidad,0
5,I love my new necklace so much！Very elegant and beautiful. It’s really expensive looking  and good quality. I shall order this for my friends. Got compliments from people already!,1
1,"Cheap suit, cheap quality, fits a barbie doll, not a plus size lady.",0
2,"Sometimes vision is blurred when wearing these lenses, mostly when driving. My wife won't wear them. I wear them around and sometimes while driving. Metal frame can get HOT when left in a hot car. Otherwise the fit and finish and style are good, and lens specs are impressive, but I would not buy again. I also bought the DUCO glasses with the plastic frames and the lenses do not distort/blur like these do.",0
5,"Easy to wrap around wherever your coldest, like your shoulders or your head… Very soft and nice colors. Great deal!",1
5,"These sunglasses checked all the boxes!  The fit is snug, but comfortable.  The wrap around design is perfect for my light sensitive eyes.  And finally, these sunglasses are inexpensive and if I lose or break them (as I have a tendency to do with glasses) it won’t cost much to replace them.  Great purchase!",1
5,"I chose this for the colors, hoping for the best on the quality.<br />It's thin, has tencel, breathable. It's not meant for winter sports etc, as in thickness.<br />It does what's it is supposed to, block.<br /> It will be GREAT for Fall. Kinda hot at 90 degrees, but you know, when you're forced.<br /> It holds itself well in wearable position.<br />Everytime I wear it, I get compliments. I dig it, when I chose to wear it<br />Not wearing such things on my face is my personal preference.<br />Colors are as shown, not muted, not vibrant cheesy, just right. Camo :)",1
5,I love this jacket. Fits great and looks great,1
1,did not fit the frames,0
5,I bought these for bedridden mom. She seems to appreciate them.,1
5,I love it! I love everything Bad Bunny!!! Great hoodie! Thank you !,1
1,Revised opinion! After first wash on gentle cycle the moccasin came apart and had to be disposed of!,0
4,I thought it would have been longer,1
4,"Nice shirt, but you need to order 2 sizes up from what you woukd expect. I ordered a size larger than I expected and it was still a bit small. Luckily it doesn't cost me anything in return shipping to exchange it!",1
5,"Love these glasses!<br />Cons: I have an issue with tightness on my face-- if the arms smush my temple too hard it gives me headaches. The brown pair were perfect and the yellow were a little tight BUT the package came with a little tool to adjust them so I'm okay with that!<br />Pro: super adorable, nice and weighty (they don't feel like cheap plastic), each came in their own drawstring bag, the package included a glasses wipe and an adjusting tool.<br />Honestly the best sunglasses I've ever had--better even than my Michael Kors ones! Cannot wait to wear them at the beach",1
5,"Bought this for a gift, they loved it",1
5,"WARM FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR & IT'S A GOOD LOOK, FIT ON MY BODY.",1
5,"As an 80's baby, I love to see items as well as brands that once ran a muck during my upbringing, back to the forefront of the purchasing world.",1
5,Cute. Loved it. Received a lot of compliments.,1
1,"One pair had scratches on the lenses, and the numbers as seen in previous rating are also there on both pairs...They weren't dollar store price, just quality...",0
1,Cute fit was weird tight to the top n baggy to the bottom to be a bodyson jump suit. I wear alot of bodycon jumpers. This one a weird made and fit,0
5,Beautiful bag of highest quality. Definitely worth the price.  My wife loves it!,1
3,"Ligero,facil de colocar el producto. el vendedor me envio 2 pulseras de mismo color.",0
5,I like it very much. Great quality material. I love blue color and snug fit. I'm 5'11 tall and the sleeves were even long for me. I would recommend getting one size up. I normally wear size M or 8. I ordered this turtleneck in M first. It felt a little small to me. I ordered L and it's perfect.,1
2,"I loved the sleeves and the general look of the dress, but the neckline was a strange sort of angular v-shape that was not flattering enough to justify the cost of this dress for me.  I returned this dress.",0
5,Nice fitting.,1
5,"Excellent quality underwear, my son loves them, very comfy! Much better quality than other more known brands.",1
3,"I didn't expect much because of the price, and in this case you get what you pay for. Fabric is quite see through. It's worth $6.99 but definitely not more.",0
5,Where have you been all my life 💕,1
3,Fits smaller than expected. I bought the black one too- that fit much better. Am keeping the white one - hoping I’d lose some weight. :),0
3,"I LOVED these tights, have 2 pairs I use all the time. I dance and ordered a new pair for an upcoming performance. They arrived and now have a pattern at the top. These were the only tights I could find that could be worn with a leotard, but now they can’t. Very disappointing!! Guess I will have to find a new brand.",0
1,Would be great jacket if spelled right,0
5,"This floral pattern is PERFECT. I knew as soon as I saw it that I had to have it. It's bright and loud and vibrant, suiting my personality perfectly. The cut of the dress is a basic A-line. I thought it was smart to have a bold pattern with the simpler design because it really lets the fabric itself speak. I got so many compliments when I wore this dress and it's perfect for the beach.",1
5,Took it to a music festival and I got so many compliments! Soft and warm too.,1
5,"*UPDATE*<br />After I submitted my review, the seller contacted me and was very apologetic about my experience with the leggings I ordered. They suggested the Flex style which was more squat proof, asked me which color I wanted and sent me a pair at no charge.<br /><br />They sent me the khaki green flex style leggings in Small (I’m 5’4”, 135-140lbs). They fit perfectly, were completely squat proof, and they didn’t slide down at all. I do have a camel toe with them but I generally wear longer shirts so that’s not much of an issue for me.<br /><br />I’ll definitely be getting the charcoal flex style soon and I hope they come out with more colors! The 5 star review refers to the Flex style, not the others. I didn’t have great luck with the other styles so I really hope they give more colors in the flex style besides charcoal, green, and pink (because I don’t do pink 😂).<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Not squat proof, even though I got the proper size. I also had a pretty major camel toe, and they slipped down.<br /><br />I’m glad they worked so well for others, but they just didn’t work for me. Returned them.",1
5,Very nice ring. Sketching is easy to see since it is a contrasting color. Highly recommended.,1
5,Beautiful piece of jewelry and it is exactly what I wanted.,1
1,"Junk, used it for a day, the zipper ripped off the bag. Don't go by the picture your, it's small your lucky to fit a ring ding in it.",0
2,Super cute but within 5 minutes in my ears they were itching and hurting.,0
5,"Best jewelry cleaner I have ever used and the best price, My silver jewelry never looked so good !",1
5,Love it..been using it,1
1,"I am 5’10” and about 155, I typically wear an 8 or a medium in tops. This shirt says “one size” and implies that it is “one size fits all,” but it actually just means that they only offer it in a single size, and that size is a small. It’s intentionally misleading and very annoying. The shirt has plenty of room around my waist but fits my bust like a sports bra. Also, at this price range I’m not asking for the moon in regards to quality, but the shirt lined in the same thin, patterned fabric so you can easily see the pattern from the lining and it looks weird.",0
3,The hat portion of this product fits well. The face shield portion would function better if it had a Velcro attachment to the hat. The hat’s tie on face shield does not stay in place on the hat.,0
5,"This is a lovely gown, very comfortable and pretty. Runs slightly big but not too much, just enough to be loose and comfy.",1
5,If you want a tactical band this is it ! The quality is insane and is much larger in person.,1
5,easy and comfortable,1
5,The material is awesome and the price is great. I'll be getting more.,1
2,very cute but the shoulder straps rubbed against my skin and gave me a burn,0
2,"Was expecting the shirt to be black with gray on upper half, the gray is actually purple, overall like the shirt, but with the color on top it clashes with a lot of my golf shorts",0
5,This shirt fits perfect (Med) ordered. The crystal on the front is kind of strange but not a big deal. I love the fit and the fabric has not gotten balls or snags. I will order more and hopefully the very small crystal falls off after a few washes.,1
3,"By looking at the model wearing these pants,  I figured they should be long enough for someone 5'6"". Wrong !  Just a heads up, they were way too short. Otherwise they fit,  but quite snug. The quality was fine and they would have been cute. Very bell bottom tho,  much more than the photo shows.",0
3,Didnt like the cut but cute shirt,0
5,"This is very pretty, the only issue I have is the strap that is velcro, is too short to go thru the buckle, I would suggest they extend it a few more inches. So I just had to cut everything off.",1
1,"First product I’ve had to return to amazon. It was the cheap China fabric that is completely see through and worst material ever. It would have been the perfect dress if it was not see through and better quality. I get it’s only 20$, but this wasn’t worth a dollar.",0
1,"The high magnification must be the cause of the ""coke bottle"" fit of glasses and frames.<br />They fall off my face constantly.",0
3,"It's a cute piece of costume jewelry, but I have a hard time keeping the chains from tangling throughout the day.",0
5,I love the vintage rustic charm of this infinity flag scarf. My husband is retired military and we are a very patriotic american family. Although when I first saw this I immediately thought how great it would look on this antique  oak round table that I have. So I see a double purpose in this scarf.<br /><br /> It is the american flag with  the blue and stars on 1 side and the stripes on the back side. It is a very soft and breathable 100% polyester material. It is light weight and very thin. The size is fantastic and since it is soft and thin it drapes beautifully. The stitching is great with no loose threads. It is very light weight.,1
2,"It's too big for most of the frames.<br />The clip has 2 little magnets to hold together with the cover. But, very easy to come off and not strong/stable enough.<br />Just not very good in design.",0
5,"This hat surpassed my expectations! I absolutely LOVE IT!  The fit is perfect.  It is More Stylish than the photos.  The material of the back rim flap, lays beautifully and is not stiff material but quite light weight.  Great Sun protection for face neck and some of then back.  Neutral color goes with anything.  I am ready for our 2-week Caribbean Resort Vacation!",1
3,"Very beautiful product, but runs big.",0
3,"Really cute jacket my daughter loves to wear it, I wasn’t too happy that it had a stain on it. But didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning during COVID so just kept it and washed it.",0
1,Bad quality,0
5,These are just as perfect as they are beautiful for my daughters recital class,1
5,Was a gift for my niece and she loved it.,1
1,Very small. Maybe for kids masks but not for adults. Very disappointing,0
5,The gloves keep my hands warm. They are thick but they serve their purpose.,1
5,Overall my daughter loved it quality was good a little smaller wrist size than expected but very pleased.,1
4,comfortable and exceptionally long.  These can be hemmed or just fold at the upper thigh and they become walking length (otherwise you will be walking on the fabric.),1
4,"Good looking, comfortable sandals!",1
5,Nice product,1
5,Just the right size,1
3,This is not a true jelinda brand garment,0
5,"These earrings have DEEP rich blue pear shaped stones.  The color is a Caribbean blue (like a Swiss blue topaz).  Most importantly, these earrings are lightweight and the posts do not irritate my sensitive earlobes with way most costume jewelry earrings do!!  I wore them twice all day long and did not even feel them in my ears!!!",1
5,WORKS GREAT !,1
3,Mmmmm. Not a fan. May work better for shorted people. Found the leg clip shirt stays work much better.  The band would not stay below my belt line when sitting.,0
4,"The material is light, and soft after washing. The shirts did not shrink. For $5.75 each they are a good value.<br /><br />I ordered Large after reading the other reviews and I am glad I did. Large fits me the way a normal womens medium would. If I had gotten Medium they would have been too tight. They hit just past the hip and are loose enough to go over shorts.<br /><br />The Royal in the Royal Blue/Light Blue package is a vibrant turquoise/teal. I like it better than the color pictured for Royal.",1
2,"Item in the color black says 100% cotton in the product description.  The label says 60% cotton, 40% polyester.  It doesn't feel like there is even that much cotton in it.  I am 6'3'' with a 36"" waist.  I ordered size large long (smallest waist size available).  It's more like XXL, super long.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because Amazon makes it so easy to return items.",0
5,This is a nice mask and it was quickly shipped.,1
5,Great dress super soft and comfortable even got tons of compliments when I wore it :),1
1,Do not recommend. Very cheaply made. Could have come out of a bubble gum machine for 50 cents.,0
2,Clasp broke on third use. Fantastic look and fit... Just can't handle abuse of an almost 5 year old.,0
4,Could be longer.,1
5,What can i say its tungsten steel,1
1,Very disappointing.  Fell apart in minutes!!,0
3,My daughter liked them. I like that she won’t get poked with the back of her ear because of the cap that screws on.,0
5,"These 1/4 Cttw Diamond Stud Earrings for Women Rhodium Plated Sterling Silver from Devin Rose New York look much more expensive than they are. I was thrilled at the solid feel. The size is perfect for my earlobes. Not heavy, so I can wear them continuously if I want! They lay flat so they do not get caught in my hair. These earrings come in a nice bag perfect for gifting. I love these because I get an expensive look without the huge cash outlay for larger real diamond earrings. See my pictures.",1
4,Got it to carry dirty cloths on my Camino trip which has not happened yet,1
1,I wouldn't call this material moisture wicking. It's similar to the plastic pants if the 80s and it's noisy with movement.,0
5,"The hoodie is really nice quality, just a bit thin and runs a bit small. Besides that, though, it's perfect and super cute.",1
3,"Shoes were a bit narrow, with no arch support. I still kept them though since they are cute",0
1,Sloppy fit,0
2,"Bought this for my granddaughter in a 9-10 yr. L this is definitely not a child large more like a woman L or even bigger it is however, a really cute shirt for someone.",0
5,SO SOFT. Gave as a gift and since it already came in a box it was very convenient. Very worth the price its at,1
1,Flimsy.  Does not look like the picture,0
3,Slightly short and a tad tight.  However I am 5'11&#34;,0
4,They're awesome perfect for my 10 month old. Some colors don't match the bow perfectly but it's not very noticeable. I'm happy to have so many choices.,1
4,"The material was very soft and comfy, but the waist part was kinda tight. I'm a solid medium in pajama pants and this was kind of small around my waist.",1
2,They appear to be everything I wanted but arrived two days after the event. This after two delivery date changes.,0
4,I wasn't too sure of what to expect but was impressed with the quality when it arrived. Nice necklace!,1
5,"Comfortable and really dark lens. Great for those bright, vision destroying days.",1
5,Great value! These shades add a yellow tint. It’s quite nice!,1
3,A lot smaller than expected. Fits the ring.,0
1,from another one I bought just to save $3. This was $3 cheaper than another one I bought. Bad cheap thin leather. The ornaments were thin and the braided leather was stiff and not of higher quality. Sent it back and bought another one of the higher priced one and I am so glad I did. I do not recommend this one at all.,0
5,"Fun bag! I am so glad that I purchased this! I got to use this for my cosplay! It is a lot of fun, small, yet big on the inside! I got to fit my big wallet, big phone and more in here! So worth the buy!",1
5,Great fit and funny shirt. Perfect for game day!,1
2,Fit was a little small,0
1,This dress is adorable but  it is so small. No way can I wear this.,0
2,Loved the color but it’s too small and they only come in one size,0
3,"I needed white pants for a class - thought these would be simple and seemed easy to care for. Pants are NOT white, but beige. Comfortable, high waist. Washed well but overall not what I expected, as they are described as WHITE.",0
2,To tight,0
4,They're cute. The quality seemed fine.  Shipping was good.<br />Returned item because it wasn't quite what I was looking for.,1
3,The picture threw me off . I was thinking I was buying 8 capes. Overall pretty good,0
5,"Absolutely love everything about this dress. All the way from the material to the fit, it perfect!",1
1,"Did not look at all as advertised and I truly question the 60 % cotton claim. Looks totally cheap, very disappointed I returned it.",0
5,"Beautiful color, very comfortable! Got lots and lots of comments. It fits just right and it's not to long.",1
2,"Small was huge. Looked well made, but not flattering on me",0
1,Not a real crystal at least mine wasn't....pretty but way to much for a peace of plastic with other plastic stones glued t this would not  heal u cause it fake rocks,0
4,Very nice looks beautiful,1
4,Go larger if you have thicker thighs!,1
1,The material is nice and soft the color is just like the picture<br />But this dress has massive stretch go a size down maybe even 2 depending on your hips and breasts<br />I’m a medium and I could wear an xs-s in this<br />I’m 5’5 160 with a Lil tummy Atletic and toned on most places and my medium Swallows me!!!<br />I have to pay extra money to get it Tailored to for me and I bought 2<br />The only reason why it’s 1 star is because it’s to large and I have to pay more money just to wear it,0
5,Comfortable for running,1
5,Great and beautiful dress,1
3,I guess  expected to fit to my head abit big and the shape on the top of the hat doesn't stay in shape I have to play with it to shape it up every time I place it on my head<br />I do like that it has sun protection that's a plus,0
1,"Inside panties were huge, they were like cheeky panties, but just imagine them huge, it was like having a bulging diaper thong on, lol.. i would recommend them. I ended up cutting the inside part out",0
5,Good quality bag. Holds everything for work except for headphones.,1
5,"What a great belt! It’s light and suits the occasion!! At first I couldn’t figure it out but then I got and it’s awesome, I love that it’s durable, hold the weight.",1
1,"Do not look anything like photo, crap quality",0
3,Just a kinda strange look,0
5,purchased for a housewarming gift. They loved it!,1
3,It is shining and come as a combination of two rings. That shining matte makes it looks cheap.,0
1,Only wore a couple times before they tarnished,0
2,"Like the other reviews the fact that the ball has the screw on it to screw into the par is really annoying.<br />After reading the other reviews I made sure to tighten the balls as much as possible so they didn't fall off. Unfortunately I must have missed on since after 4 days I have already lost one of the balls. (Luckily the bar is still in).<br />However 3 of the 4 balls are working great.<br />They are not bad quality for the price, but I'll probably have to buy another one or two just to have replacement balls.",0
1,"These shoes are way too small.  I ordered a size 10 because I have worn size 10 in all kinds of shoes for over 30 years.  These cheap pieces of garbage are so tight they cut my circulation and make my feet colder than if I don't wear any shoes at all.  The manufacturer probably saves a few cents on every pair by making them smaller than they should be.  (and yes the label says they are the size I ordered, so that is not the problem)",0
3,Cute,0
5,Love this case and what it represents! Go Dallas!!,1
1,"I knew when I looked at what I received, this was not going to work on a PS5.  I did not even attempt to install it.<br /><br />1. You receive one continuous led strip in a roll.  ONE.  How does that work when it is shown in pictures that both grills have lights??<br />2. Zero instructions on installation.  That is probably because these were not MEANT for a PS5 because there is only ONE led strip.  Yet they say this was made specifically for a PS5, but it definitely is not.<br />3. False false false advertising.  I should return this, especially for the price I paid.  There are cheaper led strips that give you 16+ feet of lights and some even have two rolls.  This one is maybe one 3-4 foot strip and that's it.<br />4. Highly disappointed and highly suspect of the other reviews.  If they received what I did, how on earth where you able to install the lights on both grills when you have one 3-4 foot led strip and why would you not post instructions on how you did it to help other people out?<br /><br />I am just going to use these lights under a counter or desk and call it a loss.<br /><br />Thanks for the false advertising.",0
5,Fits perfect long in the torso love it I would buy again,1
5,"Loved the style, fit and color.",1
3,"Pretty cheap,  some of the backings fall off.  Way bigger than I thought. Not appropriate for my 8yr old to wear everyday. She thinks they are great looking,  but not comfortable when backings slip and squeeze",0
2,The glue on the straps wore off after about a week.,0
5,Gave this to a friend for Xmas. She loved it. It matched her outfit. She wore it a lot and different ways during Holidays. Good scarf.,1
5,Beautiful top.♡ The black! Super cute. Better material than I expected.,1
5,Its good n fits so well  i like it,1
4,"Not black, more like an odd gray color. Q was the right length for my 5’10’’ height. Material is pretty cheap, not very elegant but, it’s what you get for the price.",1
5,"I’m so glad I ordered these so my husband could give them to me for Christmas! They are beautiful, have great detail and are a perfect size. Get them!",1
4,These are really cute & made well. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is they have a bad glare & I can see my eyeballs reflecting in the lens.,1
5,Absolutely adorable shirt bright beautiful colors my daughter loves this,1
1,Looks cheap,0
5,I love it fits perfectly,1
2,Stitching is uneven and mine came with a stain on the brim.,0
2,"Will serve it’s purpose but the printed design (entire reason I bought it) is off center. Since it has ear loops, centering it makes it not fit right on my ears. Fitting it properly makes it awkwardly off center. I posted 2 pictures to prove the point. It’s not so badly off that I won’t use it but I wish it was centered better.",0
2,"I wore this once for a 30 min bike ride and 1 hour bouldering and it already has a hole near the seams on the back. Fits well for me, I’m 5’6” and 123 lbs. Quality is NOT what I expected.",0
5,Nice toy glasses daughter loves them.,1
5,Too Cute! And stayed in place!,1
5,"Attractive, secure and easy to use!",1
4,"It was a tad large, but it looks prettier than the picture. It looks great with jeans and dressy casual with navy or black slacks.",1
1,"Good quality, good fit. BAD LOGO DESIGN. Shame on me for not noticing the shirt says ""Average Toel"" instead of ""Average Joe's"". Do not buy unless you want to look like a dummy.",0
5,Adorable on my granddaughter.,1
5,"I needed something to help my glasses from slipping off my face. Looked at quite a few items and decided on this. I received today.  I put them on and just amazing.  I have to remove myself now, they do not slip, slide or fall off when bending over. I barely notice or feel them. Very lightweight and easy to put on. I have had them for 5 hours already. Brilliant little helper.",1
2,It's way too smaller a messenger bag. The fabric okay. But not enough room to hold much.,0
3,Cute shirt but the material was not as soft as I would have liked,0
2,"Although the lenses and overall glasses were nice, I returned the item because the nose piece was loose and would not tighten up.",0
1,Size is too small.,0
2,I did not like the bracket because it makes your face sweaty when wearing. Not comfortable at all.,0
2,I got this for my daughter's 7th birthday and it finally got here with a knot in the chain that I CAN'T get out. Pretty disappointed 🥺<br />The A is super cute and I was so excited for it.,0
5,"Love this dress and it was the look and fit I was wanting. Its comfortable, hits right on my body. Will be purchasing another one! 😂",1
4,Quality garment as we've come to expect from Lands End,1
5,Arrived on time and looks just like the picture. Adjustable and fits around my neck perfectly.,1
2,"I was hoping it would help wake the impossible one to wake up, but it did not work at all.  Huge waste of money.  I can’t even return.  By the time you decide if it works or not, the return window is closed.",0
5,Perfect jersey!,1
3,"This is absolutely adorable, however after 2 washes, and obviously not hard use in a kinder ballet class the stiches for the toulle skirt was coming undone. Grandma has had to reinforce it a couple of times",0

5,I'm so excited about this watch band...I love the way it looks and feels..,1
1,Horrible smell and huge very huge and I'm not a little girl.. Half the lil stones were missing..and one side was longer than the other..weird very weird,0
4,Convenient. No need to take off prescription eyeglasses.,1
1,"This is a classic case of “you get what you paid for”. This three pack of leggings is cut extremely high in the front, and just as low in the back, guaranteeing that you’re going to show your butt crack every time you bend over, or possibly just standing doing nothing. Meanwhile, it’s incredibly high waisted in the front, for maximum awkwardness.<br />Likewise, the fabric is quite thin and not very stretchy.<br />You know how most athletic garments have that durable, thick, stretchy fabric that offers compression and a flattering look?<br />This isn’t it.<br />Yikes. I wouldn’t recommend this to anybody for several reasons.",0
1,"I'm 5'8"", around 145 pounds, and 34dd - I typically order a medium for tops like this and based on other reviews, I ordered a medium. This items was SO small, very tight all over, not just in the bust area. The top was also VERY cropped so that the bottom of my bra was showing when I tried it on.<br /><br />Also, the material is extremely cheap - it's that weird pajama like thin material, I hated the feeling of the material on my skin. 0/10 would NOT recommend at all.",0
4,It looks great on.  He wears it all the time.,1
5,Excellent quality and good sizes!,1
5,Really nice,1
5,"Like: 3 caps for $15 - good fit , good qulaity- what's not to like?? Buy them.",1
4,"Seem well made, fit my 8 year olds well, definitely protect well.  But one of them (Bigger than avg for 8) complained the band put a little too much pressure on his head.  So 8 might be the upper limit for age range.",1
5,Muy cumplidos. Recibí exactamente lo esperado,1
5,"Got these as a gift, for which they were perfect.",1
3,Not as expected!!  cheap look!!!!!,0
2,"I bought for my daughter, her second pair of Uggs and these fit much tighter.  Her word was “restrictive”.  So back they went...for this price they need to be comfortable.",0
1,I did not  like at all. Bad quality. No shape.,0
5,My husband loved the ring and said it makes weightlifting so much easier!,1
5,I gave bought a pair for me before Xmas. My mom loved them so much that I gave them to her and purchased the purple pair for me.,1
3,Looks nice not the best quality.,0
2,Sent back. Hat rolled in the bag it came in. It was super flimsy and crinkled when taking out the container.,0
5,Great for steampunk or vampire cosplay comes in a fancy case!,1
1,"The print is huge and makes the shirt look just absolutely dumb. HUGE waste of money. Looks like a BRO shirt. Ya know, like someone who doesn't know who the misfits are but wants a skull tee. Literally can't wear it. I have it to my kid for a nightgown.",0
5,"Loved these bras, had surgery on both breast and these were perfect after surgery, had to wear for several weeks and sleep in them and these were comfortable. Would definitely buy again.",1
1,I really liked these hats. They are soft and kept my kids warm when we went to the snow. But after one use and with out washing they started unraveling around the face. Disappointed that the quality is so poor,0
5,"Well made, comfortable and good fit. These sweat pants were a good buy!",1
5,Love this bathing suit.  Fit perfectly!,1
5,"Fantastic watch, especially considering the price.  So glad I went with this one over a $35 and up option.  This watch comes with simple enough diagrams/instructions, but if you are intuitive and explorative enough, you can figure it out just pushing the buttons.<br />Has a watch (12 and 24 hour), date, alarm, stop watch features, all standard features that work well.<br /><br />For soccer (and other athletic) timing specifically.  It comes set to 45 minutes, but can easily be set to any other time amount.  WITHOUT STOPPAGE TIMER: Timer counts down from 45 min. and at 0.00 automatically starts counting back up so you can easily see how much in to extra time you are allowing.  At 30 seconds prior to 0.00, continuous beeper goes off to alert near of end of regulation time, which can be shut off with the touch of any button.  Done.<br /><br />IF YOU'RE USING WITH stoppage timer.  Easily use another button to start and stop and additional timer for stoppage (stoppage timer is displayed above regulation timer).  Beeper does NOT go off at 30 seconds prior to end of regulation, but rather beeps at 0.00 and begins the count up.  30 second beeper then goes off instead 30 seconds prior to whatever amount of stoppage was calculated.  And final beeper goes off at end of stoppage to signal end of match.<br /><br />Great watch.  Glad I bought it.  I coach and ref and this watch is very usable.  If you don't want to alert teams to game time with beeper, simply be prepared to hit a button to shut off beep sound.",1
4,They were actually pretty nice. Quite thicker and heavier than what I had anticipated but they will work.,1
1,"I rarely write reviews but I must for this watch. It is the most complicated digital watch that I have ever used. Touch screen aside, (which is new for me) I found it to be really difficult to use and I think that it is pretty touch sensitive because it could never keep the time/date that I set it to.",0
5,"Classy and elegant !!<br />The material and the design is better than I expected. It very soft and a bit stretchy .. it's not a see through so that's even better..<br />I wear US size (S/M) but I ordered it in XL because I want it to be a fit lose shirt.<br />I wore it with jeans, red pans and pencil skirt .. it's my to go shirt !!",1
5,Very flattering,1
5,I got lots of compliments wore with sneakers I'm a size 15 was big like the model so cute and comfy 😍,1
4,I was happy to get this belt. Good price and good quality.,1
1,lo solicite hace más de un mes y no a llegado,0
5,Nice outfit. Leggings are not for knee crawling. Won't stand up to prolonged wear and tear.,1
5,My daughter loved this hat....as described,1
5,Purchased as a gift. My cousin wears it everyday,1
1,What a piece of junk.  I wore it 1 time  and fell off my wrist and lost it. It has the worst way of closing. Money down the drain.,0
5,"I had to sewn the bottoms to stay up/fit. I’m 5’1, 34DD/33/40. I purchase a size XXL to fit for comfort, but the bottoms are way to big. The top fit me how I like it. After I altered The bottoms and sewed it to fit, I was super happy!! These are comfortable with a sexy lace trim and beautiful floral pattern. Material is soft! Adorable PJ set that is stylish, conservative, and lovely!!",1
3,fits small,0
3,"I purchased the Navy size Large. Approximate measurements laying flat: chest underarm to underarm 19"", length shoulder to hem 24', across hem 19"". Fabric is similar to thick t-shirt/jersey material, not sheer, poly cotton with stretch. Metal snaps are a little heavy but close securely. Length was slightly shorter than expected, not quite as long as shown in the picture. Construction was average with some loose threads and the size label was sewn in upside down, no brand label at all. Although this runs fairly true to size but on me it was more of a relaxed fit and not the slim fit I was hoping for. I'll be returning and unfortunately they don't have it in medium or I would reorder. I paid about $7 with free Prime shipping so it was pretty good for the price and would make a good casual cardigan.",0
3,Small wrists only and on three bracelets you can’t read the message.,0
5,I need Bifocals when driving and the segs are perfectly placed for my eyes.,1
2,"I gave this two stars because the body blouse was awful and I was sent a worn body blouse top the crouch on the top had someone's dried secretion in it, it grossed me out.  I cut the crouch part out and above it because the top matches the pants I will wear a sleeveless velvet blouse over the top to show the sleeves on the blouse that matches the pants.  This should have never been sent out to anyone, do not know how this could have happened.  But very disgusting, nasty, and nauseating.  Please, do not let this happen again to anyone.  Just typing this make me want to throw up.  The pants was very nice, fitted good, I am 5'10, 155 pounds and the pants was long enough.  I would have given a four star because I loved the pants.",0
4,The legs seem slightly loose and the waist seems a little tight on the very top part. But they're comfortable and thick and I do like them.<br /><br />I got the large.,1
2,"Too slippery, can't hold on any thing!",0
5,"I am really impressed with this headband! It's super comfortable, and I love that it can be worn thinner or thicker depending on how you fold it, without it looking awkward or bulky. The fabric is breathable and soft, making it a pleasure to wear, even when it's hot out. It is a little more than I usually spend on a headband, but because of its comfort and the way it's holding it shape I am actually ordering another one since I like it so much!",1
3,This is a cute and fun bracelet. But haven’t had it long and it’s starting to come apart. Only wore it once. So I will only get it out and wear for Halloween.,0
3,good for the money but basically pretty inferior goods,0
5,Good quality. Nice long sleeves and long torso.,1
5,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it. So adorable and is really holding up. Really love it and so cute,1
4,"My daughter recently joined Gymnastics she loves rainbows, unicorns and Kitty's so this was perfect and she loves wearing it.  It is a little bigger then we thought so she has to wear it backwards because it comes too far down in the front.  Should fit her perfectly once she grows more.",1
1,"Guess these are youth sizes?  Bought two size large. They were super wrinkled, smelled like chemicals and weren’t long enough to cover my stomach. Ended up giving them to my daughter.",0
5,"Best purchase I have ever made on Amazon!  Like the name says, the wallet is very slim!!  The only complaint that I had about this wallet was that it didn't have a closing mechanism.  I know another model had a clip, but I didn't like this look.  My advise for those that want to solve this issue?  Use two very thin adhesive magnets.  The wallet closes very time and actually helps make the wallet even slimmer.  The wallet can &#34;puff up&#34; when you put some bills, receipts or extra cards in the wallet.  Adding the magnet allows me to carry all these things while still keeping the slim profile of the wallet - also keeping the wallet closed if its on a table etc.  Great wallet!  Convinced a coworker to buy one as well and he absolutely loves it as well!  I love how easy it is to get your cards out without having to actually open your wallet.",1
5,Beautiful gift for any writer. It is adjustable to make fit any/most wrists. It is lightweight and doesn’t feel to bulky or clumpy.,1
3,I searched about this I have a small nose and have a earing in it right now waiting for these to get here long wait but I'm hearing its worth it and not worth it but we will have to wait and see,0
5,"Top is a nice size, not bulky. I'm 6 ft and 198 lbs. I lift weights regularly so have some muscle. This fits nicely without the extra bulk of fabric. I ordered a large if that helps anyone in terms of ordering. Seems warm as well even without the bulk although to date it hasn't been extremely cold yet.",1
5,Yep,1
5,"I knew exactly what I was getting with this jacket however if you need a heavy winter jacket (NYC, Chicago) go with something heavier. It's the best for everyday but for brutal wind and snow you'll need more.",1
3,"With the black rope provided, it was hard to keep secured in place. I think clear elastic bands that go around the ears would be so much better. My 4 year old somehow broke it in half as well, so I wouldn't say it is super sturdy. I was able to use epoxy and fix it.",0
5,"Don’t hesitate - just buy this. It was absolutely adorable. Got a 3T for my big 2T, based on other reviews. It was slightly big, but better than being too small. He was very comfortable and everyone thought it was just insanely cute.",1
3,The band is cool. The only thing is that the leather is not good quality.,0
2,Not good quality.,0
5,"I probably could have gone a half size down, but they fit great. They are as advertised!",1
3,"The scarf is pretty, but very thin fabric",0
5,cute c:,1
5,Well made and good color. Love it.,1
5,Solid genuine soft leather...not the cheating Chinese garbage that will dig into your sides at any opportunity it gets,1
1,"These are very pretty, but now that they have snagged on and ruined a third shirt, they are going in the trash.",0
5,I love them just what I expected,1
3,I honestly don’t know how to feel about this bonnet but I for sure did have more comfortable ones in the past yeah it’s pretty but without the comfort the bonnet isn’t really worth much to me and that drawstring I hate it.,0
4,"The design of these earrings is very nice, and have quite a bit of sparkle. They are about an inch in diameter. I was hoping for just a bit bigger (for some items, the size is not given, as with these), but they will do fine as well.",1
2,Keeps sliding on foot,0
5,Face mask,1
2,"I purchased two pair of these Isotoner gloves as gifts because the description mentioned ""cold weather gloves with warm lining."" However they are not suitable for cold weather. The material and lining is very thin and not warm. They also seem small compared to other Isotoner gloves I've purchased in the past. I will have to return both pair.",0
5,Cute and fun,1
5,"I’ll be honest - I was skeptical.  I saw anything under $300 labeled a “costume.”  This is not a “costume.”  It is sturdy and something you could wear for years.  I’ve seen it alongside very expensive lederhosen and, while there is no doubt a quality difference, you certainly wouldn’t have a problem seeming under-impressive at Oktoberfest.",1
4,"I bougth them for my wife. They are so nice. I just have a remark, I could see in a specific zone of the belt, a little detachment of the coating.",1
5,Love them,1
3,Didn't care for the look once received. The ruffles seemed to be extra long and gave the illusion of a saggy upper region.,0
3,Super cute and warm! Fits well. Giving three stars because two of the snaps (one by the feet and the one that holds the headpiece on) were broken when I got it. Both the female and male part of the snap was  stuck in one side... this meant I had to tie the bottom of the headpiece on with a rubber band for today’s trunk or treat. I’m hoping to find a better option for actual Halloween night due to this problem.,0
4,"I love love love this rashguard, especially for the price.  I love the tie sides, so that I could adjust depending on the suit I was pairing it with.  And while this might not have been the intended use, the front zip was awesome for a breastfeeding mom like me.  I wore this almost every day in Hawaii and did not have to worry about sunscreen.  I will be getting more colors in the future.",1
4,"I bought this item together with another one in silver. I like the product for the price. I was charged $13.82 for both. Not bad BUT, BUT, BUT they charged me double for the shipping! Both products was in one box, one package. Shipping should just be $6.90 plus 2 cents for the price of two pairs of earrings. I suggest you don't do this to people...",1
3,"Great value for a ⌚. However, the batteries died in less than a month. Also, the strap was a bit too small and cheaply made",0
3,For me it just doesn't work for tummy control but it don't ride up so that is a plus it is comfortable you can ware it all day,0
1,"[[VIDEOID:6f0fc7274873914db0879b8ebed3cc49]] A braclet, and the necklace charms are missing",0
5,My son is absolutely happy.  I paid $10 with a $4 off coupon. Crazy good deal. I'm not sure how they'll hold up but we're excited for how authentic they look and feel and they'll be great for his tactical FBI costume.,1
5,"The blue colour is beautiful, the rubber material is soft and it fits well.",1
1,"Item is cheep and ripped the first time my husband put them on. The stitching came apart where the Green Lantern symbol is. It was a gift for my husband from our son. Side note, my son spent his own money for this item. 😞",0
5,Great item. I sent it back because I accidentally ordered a size too large due to the reviews. I'm going to re-order in my actual size medium.,1
1,The material wasnt very good and it came already snagged. I am sending it back to order something different. The picture did look accurate though,0
5,"Nice, laces, not shoes, no arch support...why did they ask that?",1
3,Fits weird at bust,0
3,The string is a little annoying. I might cut it off,0
5,"Just as described, fits my 10 year old perfect. he loves it. one small flaw is that it ripped in the crotch within an hour, other than that its great>",1
4,she love it,1
1,I received mine broken and had to order another one ASAP as it is for a USMC bootcamp graduation next week. Looked great but was defective.,0
3,These are cute but a little too big for my head.,0
4,"This case is otherwise great, but the lid does not stay open while putting the hats inside. Seems that the straps are bit too short.",1
2,Looks nice. Fits nice. The belt is small. I ordered two with different sizes (upto 4”) more than what I needed and it still does not fit. The ratchet mechanism that is used also catches and is hard to get off at times. It makes it hard to get off of there is too much tension on it.,0
2,"Loved the gray color, but don't need everyone seeing my underwear.",0
1,"Totally see through, like white sheer curtain see through. I guess it would work as a swimsuit cover up?",0
5,Wore them to the beach and pool. Not too risky at either. Just be confident and know that the liner hides enough to make them acceptable but still sexy.,1
1,"Way too big., baggy. No time to send back.",0
2,"these were cute, but didn't work out for me. The polarization made everything brighter and made me dizzy.",0
5,I'm 5'7 and the bottom of the badge hits just at my belt line.,1
4,"I love this top, but it's way too small.  Shows all the lines.  Wish I could have kept it.",1
3,I could not wear them.  I have foot problems.,0
1,I ordered a 3x because thats what size I normally wear and it fitted terrible.,0
3,To hard to get it in and same to take out,0
5,Perfect for my 4 year old,1
2,It kind of feels more like a cheap costume type of material rather than a soft/silk pj material for sleeping in. Still cute though,0
5,"I gave this watch five stars, packaging was on point and very nice my four year old granddaughter loves it and it fits very nicely. the characters on the actual strap are a nice size and show off well.",1
3,"The picture shows a heathered red shirt. The item I received is solid red. It's fine and a nice shirt, just not what I thought I was getting.",0
3,DOES NOT FIT WIDE OR LONG FACES. It is plastic and isn't flexible at all. My face is extra wide and my nose is small. Thankfully the strings can be tightened but it's not a mask meant for all face types.,0
1,Not what I thought. Not cute at all,0
1,Item is several sizes smaller than indicated.,0
5,Looks really nice. Quality product. My autographed hat looks perfect inside,1
2,The quality of the lenses is very disappointing. I did not expect them to be like glass but they appear 'warped' in places which really makes it difficult to read or use the computer. I have trouble focusing both eyes and find myself constantly switching back and forth between eyes. I have been wearing them on and off now for several months and only use them as a backup when my old (scratched) glasses are not in sight. They are better than nothing but cause too much eye fatigue to be useful for more than a few minutes at a time.,0
1,"Didn’t come with clips, sucks because he can’t use them without. I gotta order some separately",0
1,"Look how long those chest straps are!!! They just hang to your belly button, nothing like the photo where they outline your breasts. So ridiculously long like they don’t give a crap about their customers and trying to make what they sell us!! Beyond mad at being scammed!!  You can see from placement just placed randomly inside where the front tie criss crosses! It would be so easy to add straps like their photo that’s what makes me feel scammed. Almost takes more effort to do it like this then to make it correctly like their photo.",0
2,This was very cute however the Donald duck stamp you could barely see it looked very cheap not worth the price I paid for it should’ve been more like 3or4$,0
1,Broke pretty quick :(,0
5,Had to come up with an outfit for a black tie event. Went in search and wss not disappointed. Had many compliments.  Loved I didn't have to wear heels and had deep pokets to put everthing I needed.,1
5,I love the shorts. They are soft and comfy and I love that they have a pocket for my phone.,1
1,"Cheapest material, it will stick to your body, came with ripped pocket, looks bad",0
3,Not as long as in the picture. Comes to about wear her bra strap ends,0
2,This t-shirt was a knockoff and fit way too large.,0
1,Straps broke within days of using also comes with a bad smell,0
5,I really love this hoodie dress. I ware it all the time it's super comfortable and it reaches my knees.,1
3,Not what I expected,0
5,Beautiful,1
1,"They were too small for me.  I didn't realize they were non-returnable, so I'm stuck with them",0
5,exactly what i expected.,1
1,"These were listed as &#34;wide-calf&#34; compression socks, but the socks I received did not match that description. I own several pairs of the nursemates wide-calf compression socks and love the fit. The socks I received this time were obviously not wide-calf as they slide down my legs all day. If I hadn't already removed the tags, I would've returned them.",0
3,Great material but way too big. I wear a 6/8 and ordered a small,0
1,Definitely not the same jacket in the picture or even the same color. Super thin like a shirt instead of a jacket will be returning,0
5,Perfect,1
4,"I do not like the inside layer. If you put on this plus legging plus boot, you have to take off everything when you go to restroom.",1
3,Ran small.  Very thin fabric and super stretchy but unflattering,0
5,"Exquisite, perfect, and fully fit the description. I never took off my husband’s anniversary gift. I like it and get a lot of compliments. Shipment is also fast.",1
5,I love these! They are slightly curved and comfortable.,1
5,Love these. They are perfect and durable,1
1,The 2X fit more like a small!!!  Had to return!  Would not recommend this item!,0
5,"These things are seriously amazing.  I lost so many socks with my daughter and when I had my son I found these.  They are so great for going to restaurants, daycare days, or pretty much any time I want his socks to stay on.  He wears them all day and is comfortable and we never lose socks (except for in the laundry-- that's a separate issue haha).  These will be part of every baby shower or new baby gift I get from now on.",1
4,"These arrived exactly as pictured and described.  They are exactly what I was looking for, for our upcoming trip",1
3,"nice design, but is somewhat large",0
1,Way too small and too delicate for a key ring. Wouldn’t last long.,0
1,"Was very cheap looking, nothing like photo",0
4,Nice product but a bite pricey for the quality. Comparable products for half the price. Will not rcepurchase at this price.,1
4,"It's a belt dude, fits well, sturdy, soft leather, stock buckle looked good,(replaced with personal buckle) not much else to say",1
4,My granddaughter wears a size 9 and I bought the 10.  Fits like a 9 would on her.,1
5,Was way too small for a xL,1
5,Beautiful,1
1,Too small. Children size,0
5,"These feel great, stretchy with just enough compression. I bought them for under my scrubs and they are perfect. Would highly recommend!",1
3,the material and look of the fabric is way dif in person than the picture,0
5,Will definitely buy again very happy with the purchase,1
1,I'm 5'1 and 118 to 120lbs. This was way too long and it was thin. I dont know if it is even possible to wear underwear. It's also ribbed. I just think it looks cheap instead of classy. Sending it back.,0
5,"Very cool and and comfortable,  turns a few heads too.  Great buy!",1
5,The red belt looks fabulous,1
1,The material was very thin. The kimono had threads coming out. The costume was not tru to size. I was not happy with the quality of the costume for the price I was charged.,0
5,Loved them comfortable and lightweight.,1
5,I used this for my Cleopatra outfit last Halloween. One of the chains broke within the first night tho.,1
5,Nice quality. Gives child comfy fit and room to grow. Very cute.,1
5,Was a gift and arrived to them in perfect conditon !,1
1,Received this product and it wouldn't even turn on. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,0
5,"For two years I’ve worn one ugly mask after another. Finally one that’s comfortable, adjusts easily and is cute.",1
5,My husband really liked the quality of this money clip.  We both like the look of the brushed metal.  Good price,1
5,Fantastic product for my geandson,1
1,It fell apart after my daughter tried it on,0
3,So comfortable!,0
3,"On the one I received, the top hole is centered so that the handle comes out but not retractable handle. Because it stretches, you can stretch it around the retractable handle BUT when you look at the other reviewers’ photos, their hole is towards the back where it’s supposed to be.",0
2,"The patterns were beautiful, but the masks were HUGE on an aver sized adult face. Returned.",0
5,Perfect 👌😊,1
5,Great quality!! I have worn this one everyday for a few months and it is comfortable.,1
5,nice socks!,1
5,The item arrived as depicted. It was a bit snug because of the cut but the recipient still loved the jersey for sentimental reasons.  They're looking forward to when it can be worn.,1
3,"These are the cutest and look awesome on the foot but run small,  had to reorder in larger size and the big toe still was hitting the shoe uncomfortably,  never had that problem before.  Will keep and try to make work because they really are so cute.",0
5,comfy and cute.,1
3,"Thin material, doesn't have the consistency shown in the picture",0
1,RIP my hard earned money.,0
4,"Great fit, seems to be good quality fabric. Would have gave a 5 star if made in America",1
5,If was perfect!,1
1,Would rate this product 0 stars.  Bought for my 35 y.o. daughter.  She described it as less than $ store quality.  One time wear and throw away.  Will not  Order from this company again.  Very poor quality.,0
5,I wish it came in more colors! I'd buy a lot more.,1
1,These are the worse thing in the sunglasses world.,0
5,"The hats are well constructed, and looked darling on my granddaughters on the Fourth of July!",1
1,"The color on the swimsuit came off in about 5 days. Once the color comes off, the suit becomes transparent.",0
5,"This dress is comfortable, flattering and a great deal.",1
5,"This adorable sweatshirt is a must have for hedgehog lovers! The material of the sweatshirt feels more like a sports type of material rather than standard cotton. The design seems like it'll hold nicely and not he prone to peeling. The fit is comfortable and flattering. Those who want a baggier fit may wish to size up. The inside of the sweatshirt is very fuzzy and soft fleece, and it's very nice! Overall, I recommend this! It's a great bargain, I think!",1
5,"I've seen similar bracelets that are $30+ just for one, so this is a steal! Great for everyday wear. Could be worn alone or layered with other bracelets.",1
5,"This shirt is really cute, fits great, and the material is very soft! It also washes well--design does not fade and no shrinkage. Would buy again.",1
5,Excellent product and service!!,1
5,"I have had the black version for almost two years now and it still looks brand new, though I use it daily as a pocketbook.  I get a LOT of compliments on these bags.  They are extremely well made and cute.  I have a closetful of bags but the Optari Sol Tote is my bag of choice--who cares if I got the first one at Learning Express where is was sold as a childrens bag? It holds a lot of things and the way it is structured makes it easy to get to what I need.  It stands up straight.  I tossed it into the washing machine one day after I got it particularly filthy (don't ask!).  It came out looking brand new and air dried quickly.  Highly recommend! The white arrived yesterday and it is really, really nice.  I'm going to enjoy this all Summer. I wish they would come out in a leopard print!",1
3,I loved the look but hated the fabric.  Back it went which left me disappointed.,0
4,"I ordered this dress for my maternity pictures. I was a little nervous because usually white is see threw, especially under the bright flashes, but this material is thick and a little heavy, which was what I was hoping for. I ordered a small and it fits, so I would say it runs a somewhat big since I'm 7 months pregnant. All in all this dress was perfect for what I was looking for.",1
5,Un buen producto a mi hijo le gusto,1
1,These are lightweight because they are made with cheap fabric. They are not sewn properly at all. Almost every hat was damaged in some way.,0
1,"Disappointed in this dress. Runs very small. Could not even get over my bust. I wear small or medium, I got a large and it is still too tight. Fabric is thin  nor a true red. It’s more of an orange/red.<br />Contacted seller to see if I could exchange and was told no. Too bad since the cut of the dress is what I wanted. I would have exchanged for a larger size.",0
5,"Love this shirt, very soft and comfortable and loose enough to hide the belly!",1
1,They arent as cute as they look,0
5,"There are so many options for plain-colored hoodies on Amazon, but this one is amazing. I ordered the Sand color and was a little skeptical because of how ""makeup foundation"" colored it was in the picture, but based on the reviews for how soft it was I went for it. The sand color is a beautiful darker tan with a little hint of a heathered effect for some dimension. The wrist and waistbands are pretty stiff but can be fixed with a little stretching. In men's hoodies, I typically buy a Large so that it fits, but I wanted oversized but not huge and the XL is great. Highly recommend.",1
1,"Had big pleats, no slots for belt, very small in waist, large in legs. Nice fabric, might be nice for someone else.",0
1,"The zipper does not support the dress. Very poor quality zipper! As you try to zip the dress the teeth break off at every place the fabric changes thickness and texture. The dress was not tight. I don’t like things to tight so I order a size bigger. It was perfect. No body hugging. I loved it until it was to be zipped!!!  It was all over! The zipper popped teeth in a few places and there was no way of fixing or of pinning it at this point. I was extremely disappointed. It was a beautiful dress but if it can’t zip, how do you give it a good rating! Impossible!",0
5,love It.,1
5,Very nice quality for the price.,1
4,Great fot and perfect for hair protection!!!,1
5,Beautiful and very good,1
3,Not as long as I'd like,0
5,I am 5'3&#34;.....first maxi I bought and didn't have to have hemmed!,1
5,Fits just right and love the look. As seen in y<br />The photo,1
3,Is see through which I need this dress for baptism so it won’t work. Would have to wear something under I thought it would be more thicker less see through. But it’s comfy and fits,0
5,My daughter loved her gift,1
5,I gave these to my bridesmaids on the night of my rehearsal dinner and my girls loved them! Great quality. And came with a cute little pink bag to gift in. They wear them all the time!,1
5,Perfect for the gym!,1
5,Excellent product and great service,1
4,"Easy for my 5-year-old to put on, versatile style, she wears them to play and to church. They are still holding up well after a month of daily use.",1
2,These are very small for a little girl.  But ok for the price.,0
5,This is a wonderful cosplay I can't wait to wear it out! The detail is amazing and the shoulder cover helps keep you toasty :D  I will be using this as a cosplay for colder seasons,1
1,"The length of the shoe is fine but the sides pinch and rub. I thought this would vanish after a few days but didn’t . I have a normal shaped foot , and these are not made properly.",0
3,Runs small,0
5,Very pretty,1
5,"I love how they fit! They are my favorite sports bras!  I first wore them with the padding, but since then have taken the pads out and they are still great!  I may order more!",1
5,Great t shirt ! I get a lot of comments fits great Love it,1
1,"Very thin fabric, not warm at all. Plus the pocket seams were not sewn right & I have to sew them myself! Won’t buy again!",0
2,The bar might be surgical steel but the metal on the back of the flower turned my skin green :/,0
1,"The material is very low quality, it drops crumbs all the time which fall all over the clothes and mouth during skiing",0
5,Fit perfectly out of the package and looks fabulous!,1
1,These glasses are junk. The people who rated it 5 stars must have no idea about quality or attention to detail. These glasses look and feel like they were made from the same company that makes 3D glasses for the theater. Even the nose grips are like my grandmas glasses from 50 years ago. Worth $10 tops.,0
2,This top is way too small must b made for skinny ppl,0
5,Excelente abrigo a buen precio,1
3,Hay que mejorar el talle,0
1,Item runs way too small,0
4,"The dress fit well overall, but I did have a lot of excess material in my stomach and on my back. If you’re borderline between two sizes I’d recommend ordering the smaller size. It is very form fitting through the hip area, so I could wear my spandex because you could see the lines. Otherwise a great dress for the price!",1
1,Extremely thin material and poorly made. It was returned.,0
1,They run a little small. I normally wear large but should have went with an extra large on this one. After the first wash it basically fell apart,0
5,Keep my earrings safely in my ears and make it so I can sleep in them comfortably,1
1,I ordered size M because it is what I always buy the brand Johnny Was. Blouse I received seems a 2X. I can do two with her. I'll have to take her to cut her at least 10 centimeters on each side.,0
4,I brought it for my sons homecoming. He loved it,1
5,Great product I wear as a bracelet or a necklace,1
5,Love this I can't wait to give this as a gift to my coworkers daughter!  Arrived just as pictured,1
4,"Super cute jeans! Cut is a little tight in the thigh, but other than that- ok!",1
4,Really cute bohemian statement Earrings. Love the look. The reason I knocked off a star is because the post on the back of the earring is very flimsy and thin and already came bent. I wear costume statement earrings all the time and I’m concerned these won’t last very long because of that issue. Great look though!,1
2,Lasted 3 weeks before bottom of shoe came apart.,0
3,Runs small,0
5,Looks great,1
5,"Gorgeous set. I have bought several as gifts and my friends love it, too.",1
5,"I like that this is a bigger charm heart than the other NinaQueen hearts, but is very delicate also.  The filigree detail is very fine and the little silver heart &#34;Holes&#34;  on the edges look like they were cut  out with a cookie cutter and the &#34;Heart cookie&#34; placed on top to decorate the cake.",1
5,"These are beautiful! I bought the 1.25 carat size, and I'm thinking about buying a few of the other sizes to have a selection of them.",1
3,it broken at the middle of the stones,0
2,"The design is hilarious and cute, and the ears are adjustable, but the fabric is way too wall and wide. It's baggy and doesn't fit right. I have an average sized face and typically don't have an issue with masks. This one has too much fabric and looks gawky. When I pulled it apart to adjust the nose piece, it goes from my chin up to close to my eyebrows.",0
2,They are clearly not mirrored as advertised. And the frames are just as small as my other glasses. Dimensions can't be right on this.,0
5,Seems like a good quality belt. This is my second one and both work flawlessly.,1
1,"Two sets of these silver hoops have broken, both within a 4 month period. Just fell out of my ear in peices. Beautiful,  but poorly made.  I'm so disappointed.",0
3,"This Jacket looks very nice, but it is cut small. You'll need to buy it one size larger than your regular size.",0
4,"Some of the tulle on a few of the socks were sewn crooked, so the tulle was sideways whenever the socks are straight. But a few pairs came out okay and they will be beautiful in our spring photoshoot.",1
2,Just opened the package that was supposed to contain 3 pairs of earrings. It only contained one pair.,0
3,Cute tight & sexy,0
1,wrong color around pink flower should be silver,0
5,Gr8 item nice quality & fast shipping highly recommend  :),1
1,Not at all what I expected. Could not figure out which way it went on. The bottom looked like the top and the top looked like the bottom. Very confusing. Looks amazing on model but not in real life.,0
3,"I thought it was cute and tall girl friendly. However, I had to return because it was see through.",0
2,"So pretty and substantial feeling glasses, however, they broke after wearing them a couple of times",0
5,It’s cute and fits well,1
2,Little to small,0
5,"I little long on me but I am short, nothing that I can’t fix. The dress you can wear with boots or heels and looks fantastic",1
2,Holes on the end were to small to fit my sunglasses.,0
2,"I'm returning these - they run so small, maybe by 3-4 sizes.",0
5,These are beautiful with a perfect weight to them.<br />I am thankful I bought them as a gift for my mom!,1
5,It worked out perfectly to dress up the fitbit with my bridesmaid dress! Loved that I was able to adjust easily to my size with the tool they included in the package.,1
5,BOUGHT FOR MY BRIDESMAID I WOULD MOST DEFINITE RECOMMEND,1
5,"Robe is gorgeous. Material extremely soft and comfortable.  Unfortunately, I got this robe as a gift for my wife and she is kind of in between sizes.  The robe was not quite large enough on bottom to close as she wanted.  Contacted company for refund and they were fabulous.  Quick response.  Extremely fair offer for refund and still keep the robe.  Also, company was very interested in hearing about fit problem so they could adjust fit in future manufacturing.  Couldn't have been more pleased with the company's handing of the situation.  Highly recommend this company.",1
5,Comfortable soft and warm great for the price,1
5,"FANTASTIC!!! Great quality, style, durability features, and for less than $30. Best duffle bag ever owned, and I have gone through at least 15 in my lifetime. Designed to be stylish, far superior to the traditional 'gym bag'.......perfect for travel. Construction pluses includes a. fine zipper teeth making super easy open/close b. nice big quality chrome pulls...not cheap ones with string pulls c. separate inner lining with stylish imprinting.....not the cheap 'all in one outer/inner material' d. expensive/high quality/durable nylon exterior construction........not the traditional cheap PVC material ie I'm a chemist and know the difference e. 4 bottom feet to prevent dirty surface contact, although should be a bit higher to be more effective f. sooooo much more.......buy one, you'll be delighted for the next many years of service!",1
5,Before I purchased these earrings I read most of the reviews. Some reviews stated the earrings were to small but I think they are a perfect size. They are very pretty and seem well made.,1
2,Way too small,0
5,very helpful.,1
5,"Theyre great material, stretchy, great for the gym",1
5,I very like this bag.  It's looks nice and elegant with good quality. Material is washable so it will be perfect for my nursing program.,1
5,"This brand was recommended in an article I happened to read because they were reasonably priced and they are made very well; they ticked all the boxes so-to-speak. I love them! They fit well, the fabric is strong, no see through and they are super comfortable!",1
5,Very nice bag.... almost too nice to use for a climbing bag. Construction is great and the features are very well thought out. DMM wins again!,1
4,"Está aceptable, pero se torna un poco diferente el color de la presentación.",1
4,I really like this elephant but it fades out after 2 weeks and it doesn't look pretty. I just found the same one later at a store for only 3 x $10.,1
2,"I got it for my nephew, it did not fit him and it is made of cheap material.",0
3,Both of the crystals fell off the first day we wore them.,0
2,Fits like a maternity dress.,0
2,Order up. Xxl fits like a large. Material is weird and stiff.,0
5,"Great shirt, bought it for my son and he loves it!",1
5,Like that it's soft.<br />I not like that it doesn't have  pockets four the pants.,1
2,"This cape is nice and big and will cover the top half of most people, which is great. It's material will keep the hair debris and hair products off of your body, but don't expect to come out of a hair washing completely dry. Unfortunately, this was my main purpose of purchasing this cape. I soaked my hair and rinsed it out, and I was left with a wet t-shirt underneath. I ended up returning this because of it. It's a shame because I do this the pattern is neat.",0
1,I ordered size Large and they are nothing close to the size chart on Nomad's website. Returned and spent more on a better pair.,0
1,Very disappointed!! It arrived broken!!!,0
5,These are cute and fit normal filters. Fits well and I've received many compliments.,1
5,Looks just like the advertised pics. I got the pink and it’s so cute & also has a loop to put onto a hook,1
1,This style is not flattering on most bodies. I really tried to like this but it was so ugly. Bottoms were poorly made and looked cheap. Top was too thin. Boxy look. Returned.,0
4,My son absolutely loved these. Be sure to wash on gentle cycle. I washed one in with regular clothes and there are now snags all over the front making it difficult to recognize the picture.,1
3,"I really like that the fabric is actually opaque, but I bought Plus Size because my thighs are pretty thick and they still dig into my thighs if I wear them too high (in line with the start of my butt cheeks) which is where I normally like to wear high thighs high enough so that my inner thighs don’t chafe.",0
3,My charms came in broken. Even though they’re beyond gorgeous,0
3,it fits but it has a manufacturing smell of oit,0
2,I am 5”8 and 162. I ordered a large. This dress is really tight. So make sure to order a size or two more. Material was okay.,0
2,"Good quality fabric but the fit is very strange.  I ordered a size up and could hardly get it past my hips but the bust was too large, not a flattering fit and had no support.  Probably would have made it work if the halter tied in the back but its just a clip so you can't adjust the top.",0
4,works well and was given to the fish collector of our family.  He really likes it and wears it on occasion,1
2,"I loved the bracelet, but it’s strung together with a plastic line and it broke within a weeks time.",0
2,This is for children. So very small.,0
5,"Sized up on boots, fit well. Bought shoes and kept true to size, no. Had to return the shoes.",1
4,"I probably should have ordered this a size smaller, but there is no size chart with measurements.  It is perfect around the neck and way big und the arms.  I am going to take a tuck in there, rather than trying to return this.  Otherwise, I love this top!  I think I can make it work.",1
1,"Worst purchase ever. Way too small.ordered xl and got what looks like a medium. Material is slick and thin and feels like swimsuit material (shiny, too). Seam is coming apart in crotch area - right out of the package. I don't know how these pants have high reviews. Utter garbage.",0
1,"Weirdly sewn, baggy",0
1,This item is cheap!!!!!!!,0
3,"I bought the Marine blue marl in size small (I’m 5’5 and 145lbs) the fit was PERFECT and super flattering HOWEVER The sweat was super noticeable! I was really disappointed because i thought i finally found a good pair that would hide the sweat, especially because i had read an earlier review that said the marine blue marl was recommended by the company for this specific reason. I’m pretty disappointed. I guess I’ll only wear them for lighter workouts…",0
3,"While the slipper is well made and good looking, they run rather small.  Definitely recommend choosing the next size up.",0
3,Cute but seem to run a little small.  One slipper was missing some stuffing so the head is droopy.,0
3,"Son bonito pero no muy buena calidad,  no le duraron mucho, se hicieron feos por dentro",0
3,"Very stylish, but a little too large for my small face. The major downside is that they do not really provide much protection from the sun.",0
5,"Great socks, really enjoying them and will definitely reorder!",1
5,These fit very well and are very warm.  I like them because they look good with work cloths.  They work well as driving gloves.,1
4,The lava rock holds the oil well. The chain looks much cheaper in person than it appears in the picture.,1
5,I really love the way it fits and the material is very smart.,1
1,They ripped while I was getting into my car. Only wore them 2-3 times.<br /><br />Poor quality.,0
5,"Size run a bit smaller , and seems cheaply made, would not order again",1
4,The dress was in great quality! Love the material. Beautiful silouette. I bought the wrong size. Totally my fault on that part.,1
2,Was not the quality that I expected it to be.,0
4,I read the reviews carefully before deciding on a size. I'm 5'3&#34; and around 120 but a bit chesty so I went with a 2XL. I probably would have been ok with an XL but it fits! I'll see how I like it when I actually wear it for swimming this weekend.,1
3,Good thing I bought this to go with high waisted pants because it doesn’t even reach my belly button.  I should have sized up several sizes.,0
4,"Nice price for brush, cleaner and travel case. Case was small but premium feeling. Cleaner took off stains after 2-3 coats and the cleaner smelled great. Only thing I would complain about is some of the bristles on the brush were coming off during use not a big deal for me but maybe for others.",1
2,"Had a very hard time keeping these on my ears, its like they did not want to fit, now it could just be my ears. So I would not necessarily not buy these because of this review. Each person is different",0
3,"Super cute but the shirt is a crop top, I want to be comfortable at home not put on a sexy fashion show",0
5,well constructed sturdy fabric but very quick drying.  Just what I was looking for.,1
4,Good fit,1
5,I just love these so much! I bought two pairs! I wish there were other flowers! Great quality! Dainty but sturdy! I get tons of compliments on them every time I wear them!,1
5,"Seemed a bit larger, but that will let me wear thick, luxurious winter socks :)",1
5,Love them,1
5,They were perfect for New Years Eve Celebration! and reasonable is $$$$ too!,1
1,Very very cheaply made and just completely see through.,0
3,"Very nice. The only issue, I can't get the links out and will have to take it to a<br />Jewelry store for them to be removed.",0
4,They're very easy to open and close and click into place so I don't worry about them falling off of my ear. My only complaint is that they're bigger than described on the listing.,1
4,Good product but  Fits smaller than expected.,1
3,"A Neat piece but too pointy at top for a Dalek, but going to use as a game piece so it will be good enough!!!!",0
4,"The merchandise was as good as it gets, however I has to go to a dealer to get it cut  as cutters would  not cut a key they did not sell",1
5,He loved it and it fits him well! I am very happy with the purchase!,1
5,Just perfect,1
2,Very cute dress.  Material did not hang well.  Bunching at the hips with extra material - did not lay flat on hips.,0
2,"Terrible product. Too small, arms not long enough, waist so short I couldn’t tuck it in.",0
5,Durable and cute!,1
1,The zipper literally is so weak it fell off after 2 wks. Barely worn.,0
5,"My frame: 5’2”, 120lbs. Top: 0-2 US size or small; VS bras 32-34 A. Bottom: 2-4 US size, small to medium.<br /><br />Package arrived on time. The bikini is super cute! The color is very vibrant. The crochet material feels nice to touch. I believe it’ll be a good idea to put it in a laundry bag when I wash it, as the threads may come apart ‘cause you know, it’s crochet. The bottom fits perfectly; but for the top sadly I’m not blessed with fuller breasts it fits loosely; a sticky bra should fix it up.<br />Hope my review is helpful!",1
4,Very nice cover-up.  Wouldn't wear as just a dress.  Fits a little small so size up.,1
5,Love it! Same as in pictures. Very roomy. Smooth zippers.,1
3,the price is too much for this.  This one is not up to the original case for Ray ban.  Price is more.,0
5,Very nice!,1
3,"It was pretty, but the description said it would fit up to a 7 inch wrist.  Mine is 6.5 and it looked stretched.  I returned it.",0
2,Terrible make up.  These are not typical lose fit pants.  They have a tight elastic at the top that just kills it ... would have been nice if it were mentioned.,0
1,Based on size guide I bought a M and it is at least 3 sizes too small,0
5,"Very soft material.  Fits perfectly, very comfortable and cute",1
5,"Affordable luxury—Highly recommended! This scarf is exactly what I wanted. The cashmere and silk blend is incredibly soft. The weave is really nice and the color is spot-on. A few years ago I lost my Chan Luu cashmere and silk scarf and I’ve been missing it ever since, but couldn’t justify the $250 to replace it. This scarf is a brilliant replacement—better colors, softer, and for 1/4 the price!",1
5,vey nice and fast delivery,1
3,Good material and really pretty but I ended up returning it because it was too small.,0
1,Wear as nightgown not happy with purchase👎🏻,0
4,These earrings are super cute and comfortable. I would say there is slightly variation from the picture just because its hard to accurately see the colors on the picture. Overall wonderful.,1
1,"The shoe is really cute, but the quality was awful.  These are supposed to be clear jellies with bits of glitter inbedded.  The jelly (plastic) is flawed and cloudy in many places and I could not even wear these shoes.  I guess you get what you pay for.",0
5,"I have always had a difficult time finding sunglasses with both the style and features I prefer.  I have purchased a pair of Foster Grant sunglasses that worked well for me but the lenses got deeply scratched and that particular model was discontinued by FG.  I searched Amazon for Metal Frame Glasses with Spring Hinges and found these.  After wearing them for a week, I am very pleased with the purchase.  These glasses have an excellent fit, are comfortable and provide great glare reduction.  I was a bit concerned since this was the first pair of sunglasses I've bought over the internet but I could not be more satisfied with the purchase.",1
1,I was never able to wear these earrings. It came apart when attempted to.,0
5,Thick and cushy.,1
5,Nice sweater.,1
1,They look so cheap !,0
5,"I read the reviews and saw pictures from the reviewers before I purchased this dress. They were all right the dress is BEAUTIFUL, comfortable, and true to size. I LOVE it more in person than some of the pictures I saw on here. A MUST BUY! Totally would recommend and you can't beat that price.",1
5,"This was a huge hit!  Best and easiest Halloween costume I have ever had.  Bought this hat, WELL worth the $35.  Then got a cheap white robe, white belt, business socks and through on business shoes, and I was set.<br /><br />MUST BUY if you want to be cousin Eddie for Halloween.",1
5,Great for summer.,1
3,"I love my other 90 Degree pants (the solid colors). However, these heather ones are a different material and a different fit. I ordered the same size as my others but these have absolutely no give in them. They were skin tight. You could even see the lines in my &#34;no show&#34; underwear! The material is also not the same as the solid color leggings. This material is not soft, but more stiff almost. I will be returning this pair and ordering another solid color.",0
5,I absolutely love this dress. I needed a bridesmaid dress quickly for my best friend’s wedding and after being severely let down by a big chain bridal store I had little time to find anything else. Thank goodness for Amazon. I ordered this dress a few days before after carefully reading the reviews and the dress came the next day. It fits amazingly and is honestly the most flattering dress I own. I love the 1950s inspired style and the quality of the dress. It fits so well and honestly fits and feels like it cost so much more. Thank you so much Amazon for coming to my rescue.,1
2,did not wash well,0
5,Love this.. looks just like the pic..,1
4,Great  product!!!,1
3,A couple of them broke very easily. Used for a play but definitely not built to last.,0
3,They’re basically extra long shorts,0
5,Works well! It definitely keeps my chapsticks more handy! The mermaid tail ones don't really cover the while chapstick but i'm totally fine with that because it provides eaay access to the chapstick. Lol,1
2,Smelled of wet and moldy leather.,0
3,"Good quality glass, unique piece, would have given it five stars if it were half as big! This pendant is very large, thick, and heavy; I don't own any jewelry even close to this size and I hope that the person I bought it for is more into chunky jewelry than I am. Also, I'm glad I went back to this page to see how to put it on the cord...if you just string it on, it doesn't lay flat, you have to do it like it's pictured here. I would have preferred if it came with a ring on it, I think.",0
2,"The sizing on this sweater was wacky. The chest was larger than I expected and the sleeves were at least 6” longer than my arms but were too tight to be comfortable. The deal breaker for me though was that the collar was nearly too small for me to get my head through and then felt like it was choking me once I managed to get the sweater on. Despite what my wife may say from time to time, I do not have an unusually large head.<br />I would totally believe this was a hand knit sweater: it was proportioned just like the ridiculously ill-fitting hand knit sweaters blind grannies make in comedy skits.<br />It may be the one I received was just “off.” The seller was great about accepting returns and I may try to order one again in the future because I liked the look and feel of it (aside from the fit). It might be worth giving this a shot by ordering it for yourself but Is be cautious about sending it as a gift unless the recipient won’t be shy about asking to return it if it is weird.",0
1,The swim suit is really cute but it has stains in the bottoms looks like someone returned it after they put it on in that’s just nasty in why would you send this to me very upset 😡😡😡,0
1,Terrible stitching. Buttons were barely holding on when I got it. Ended up having to see those on again. It's literally ripping at the seams. Honestly don't get it. Awful coat. Only wearing it while I wait for the good one to come.,0
5,"They are very comfortable but kind of pinchy so not recommend for sensitive ears, there very good quality and I can wear them all day and they will not move at all.",1
5,Exactly as described in the description. Perfect for my 8 yr old at school,1
1,The thong piece was too vroad and the fabric too rough on the rectal crevice. Use a softer fabric.,0
5,Perfect for me. I'm a 28X32 and the fit is wonderful. sturdily constructed pockets are perfect size. they laundered well,1
2,The shirt ripped even before washing. Comfy but cheaply made.,0
2,The shirt was nice however way too small.,0
4,For the price this scarf is pretty cute and looks exactly as pictured on the model. Scarf looks more expensive then it is. I have a thing about not paying much for a scarf cause the expensive ones tend not to look that much better then cute bargain scarves. This is a keeper if you are on the fence.,1
3,"Have a small work out area in my basement that I use- these weights are affordable and fit well into a small area like mine but the are a bit combersome when actually working out with them and it’s also in metric, they aren’t ideal but for the price u can’t ask for much more. I would deffenetly recommend this to someone with a small area to work out and a small budget.",0
1,Necklace came in broke and it's not returnable.  So I paid for a broken necklace I can not wear.,0
2,"Very very small, I wear a 14 and the larger they have looked like a child.",0
4,Can’t wait to give it to my matron of honor,1
1,"Not very strongly made, I really needed these too",0
5,so cute! the details are so nice!,1
5,My son really likes these for swimming.,1
2,Large and material  thin,0
1,Not comfortable,0
4,Runs Small,1
3,Purchased in a large. Almost fits like an XXL. I do like the material.,0
2,Uncomfortable to wear,0
3,Wanted to love it but the sleeves were too long and the fit was boxier than expected. Sadly it was returned,0
1,Super loose and not flattering at all also really long,0
1,"You can see through them, especially if you are gifted in the butt area",0
4,Works to keep the swelling down. The decor on the glove is not shiny as pictured. Does not fit extremely snug.,1
1,The rubber is way too soft.  Can't complain too much when it cost so little.,0
1,Heel too tall,0
5,I am so glad I got this dress. I'm always scared to order online. Because it's hard to guess if it will fit. But it fit great.,1
5,Everything fit great and it works well for playing in the pool with my kids!,1
3,"They were a lot smaller then in the picture,they don't look like the picture either,but it will work,I guess.thanks though",0
3,Pretty!,0
1,Save your money,0
5,"A comfortable shirt.<br />I bought 3 of them.<br />I was going to buy more but suddenly, from one day to the other, the price jumped up from $8 something to $18 something????<br />What a SHAME!!!!",1
5,Absolutely love it! Soft and pretty.,1
1,I ried to send this bracelet back too big and bulky.  I tried to send this item back and I printed out the return label and notice that I had to pay for the return.  I went to see how much it was too return and it was OUTRAGOUS!!!!! It would have costed me $99 to have it returned to China.  This crap!  I'm thinking of not ordering anything ever again!,0
1,"Wow.....so these are really cute...BUT I ordered 5 of these bracelets...every bracelet had a noticeable flaw in the colors on the pumpkin and the first one I took out the package to try on, the magnet on the bracelet fell out and we're still currently looking for it",0
4,cute necklace but it keeps falling off,1
3,Gorgeous but the post snapped off when I was trying to put one of them on one day.,0
5,"I'm not very fashionable, so wearing scarves is a new thing for me, but I always get compliments when I wear this one.",1
3,Very thin. Always tips after the 3rd wear. Don’t have any kind of nail. You can probably not rip these if you have no nails at all.,0
5,Well made and fits great. No complaints. Wish they had additional colors available but the black goes with everything.,1
4,"This is a great ring! Many this size or type are hollow inside but this is solid. Arrived in reasonable time if you consider it shipped from China. I gave four stars because there is no great way to figure the right size without trying some on. I used a guide and ordered a 15 for my ring finger. It is a size too big so I either have to wear it on my index finger or put a small section of plastic tubing on the palm side of the band.  Chose to do the latter, the great price would be pointless if I had to send it back..",1
4,Smaller than expected but it looks perfect,1
5,I love this purse.  Just the right size and weight. All my essentials have a place,1
1,"poorly made, do not look like the picture",0
4,Nice rings,1
1,These literally came in a kid size. My fat self could not fit in these but yet i paid for a plus size,0
1,Way to big in the waste. Feels like a ton of extra bulky heavy material. Very pretty dress but not true to size,0
3,"This shirt fit fine, but the neckline is what I don't like.  It's bunched up in weird places and looks uneven...honestly looks pretty cheaply made.",0
5,Part of zipper was broke but fixed it fit perfect,1
5,Super cute and fit perfect.,1
5,I don't like I love it. the best belt I have ever worn.,1
5,"Let me start by saying I am very very picky. I read every single review before placing my order... I was still skeptical. I have ordered cheesy little polyester dresses from Amazon before, some better than others. For the price I had low expectations. My dresses arrived today and all I can say is I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. I ordered the grey short sleeve and the grey tie dye. They run really really BIG so keep this in mind. I’m usually a true medium in everything or a size 8. I ordered a small based on the reviews, its perfect. I actually could have gone down to an extra small, so if your curvy and skeptical.... just go ahead n order it. I promise you will not be disappointed. I’m ordering more for the summer. Oh, almost forgot the material is a nice thick cotton n they have pockets!",1
5,Everything that I look for in a book bag and lunch pal for my daughter very great product,1
5,Excellent product,1
5,So cute and the colors/pattern were even prettier in person,1
5,"I love the Nike brand and glad I found this sports bra. I will definitely give the Baker family 5 Stars due to delivering as promised. Even more important, teaching their children value of working to obtain their goals in life. I am extremely impressed! Also, thanks for the gum ! I hope all your dreams come true!",1
3,"Used this for about six months, but taking it off and putting it back on stretched out the fabric and now it moves all over the place on my wrist. I had to buy a different brand to replace it.",0
5,"This cloak is very well made and warm. The material is better than expected. For the price, you cant go wrong",1
2,"The Zipadee-Zip product from Sleeping Baby is great but this Flying Squirrel just really isn’t necessary, don’t waste your money.<br />Our first son did great with the Zipadee-Zips but hated wearing these so we just skipped this second step and went straight to a regular blanket without a problem.<br />Our second son is now wearing the Flying Squirrel that we had purchased a while back since we already had it. We recently tried purchasing another Flying Squirrel since our old one has ripped but the size was way too big even though it was the next step up. Unfortunately Sleeping Baby does not offer free shipping or free returns/exchanges. Long story short and many emails later with Sleeping Baby customer service, I’m out $15 for ordering the wrong size ($6 to ship, $6 to return and a $3 restocking fee) Just be sure you order the right size the first time.",0
5,They were a perfit fit.,1
2,So very short!!!!!!!,0
1,The top surface started peeling off in a few weeks.,0
5,"I rolled my ankle and I have to wear a boot. With three, I can wear pants. And I get to look like a 90s raver.",1
5,"great product, recommend it to everyone!💪🏼🔧⛏🛠🧱🧰⚒🪓 perfect",1
5,"Very pretty and I wore it as an accent to the clothes I wore to a granddaughters graduation. I got many compliments. One of the chain links came  loose, but I used a small pair of needle nosed pliers and a very small drop of gorilla glue, and bim, bam, boo, it is just like new. Love the choker and plan to wear it a lot.",1
2,Does not stick,0
5,"I remember buying belly button rings in the early 00's and I'd get one for the price of these 10! With that in mind, I'm really happy with the  quality of these. They look just like in the pics, although the rods (the piece that goes through the piercing) seem a tad short, but it still fits in my piercing.",1
5,It’s absolutely gorgeous !!,1
1,great buy,0
3,"OK, but will not re-order",0
3,"Not bad for the price actually. The hems seem unfinished though and I'm a little worried they will fray with washing. The sleeves feel oddly tight in comparison to the shirt though. The necklace is junk, cheap plastic that would go nicely with a ring from a gumball machine, gave that to the cats to play with lol. Overall, I am satisfied for the price but would not purchase again because of quality.",0
5,Super flattering on the butt,1
5,Very elegant. I loved it:) and it came much quicker than anticipated.,1
3,"Fits great, cute dress but...<br />I got this for my mom as a gift but she will never wear this out in public due to the unfortunate flower placement. She said it looks like pasties lol. :/",0
3,"I have purchased this same brand but the footless calf sleeve (nude color) in a size xxl and it fit perfect and comfortable. I decided to purchase this style, in size xxxl because it states it fits a 26in calf. When I opened the item and compared it to my footless sleeve I could tell immediately the sizing was off. I did try to put it on thinking maybe it would stretch but it didn't and it was too small, so I am returning it.",0
4,"I like the fabric and I think that overall it is a good quality skirt for the money.  Originally ordered my usual size, but it was too snug for my taste.  Re-ordered a size larger.  Much better!",1
5,Worth it,1
5,Wonderful hat for those that don't like baseball caps,1
1,I did not like these at all. The do not look classy nor attractive in my opinion. I did not find them to be as pictured.<br />I returned them.,0
2,"Tiny holes have appeared in all pairs, very poor quality",0
5,Seem very durable and really cute but I somehow bought 2 pairs..,1
3,This hoodie is too short bobied and I’m short. Poor quality but it was relatively inexpensive so this is an example of you get what you pay for.,0
1,It was a piece of junk and arrived broken,0
4,Very good quality,1
1,"A women's size large is like a kids 10/12 not kidding ! The set fits my 10 yr old.... don't buy , RUNNNNN<br /> Don't waste your money.",0
1,It broke literally a week after the return window closed. The band just fell apart. Not a good product at all.,0
1,"It broke only after a couple weeks, and the silver anchor tarnished horribly! Says &#34;stainless steel&#34;, but stainless steel DOES NOT tarnish this bad, this quick!",0
2,"The butterfly anklet broke after a few days. Such a shame, they book looked beautiful.",0
1,Very chip!,0
5,"It should fit me, in a few months. Great price-great seller.",1
1,Too small and I got a size up from what I wear.,0
2,"I am disappointed with this item.  It is smaller than I expected, and the color is more flat than I expected.",0
1,the chains on the necklaces break right away.,0
1,I'm only 5 feet tall and the waistline of this sweater falls right below my bust making my body look awkward. I would not recommend anyone purchases this sweater.,0
3,"It would be nice to know what height model they use for &#34;over knee&#34;. I'm 5'8&#34;, and these are comfortable as knee socks, but if I try to pull them above my knee, they aren't quite long enough.",0
2,"Quality is very poor, very thin not what I expected for sure not recommend",0
5,ok,1
5,Comfy,1
1,The wire came out. The fit was too big,0
2,"It looks nice and fits my Fitbit charge 3, but I was able to disconnect the band with the slightest of tugs. This will work great for most people. But those that like getting their hands dirty, work labor, or are generally active...this will not hold up. I'm just going to bite the bullet and order a replacement band from Fitbit. You get what you pay for and I was just trying to save money.",0
5,The item was matchless! Very speedy delivery. Enhancing packaging. Good service.,1
5,"I have had a black pair of these for years and decided to buy the brown. So very comfortable, great arch support and perfect warmth - my feet don’t get cold (they get cold a lot!) but also importantly don’t overheat. Looks like they don’t make them anymore because I wanted a back up in black but can’t find them in my size. I wear an 8 in shoes and usually an 8.5 in boots - bought the 8.5 and they are perfect! Don’t hesitate if you are thinking about as they may not be available for long!",1
3,"I was very excited to have a wallet that would match my purse, however this wallet is RED! I still gave it 3 stars, because it's well made, has great organization, and I am keeping it because my old wallet was falling apart, but I am seriously bummed about the color.",0
1,"I bought this for my daughter as a birthday present. She loved the look of it and immediately put her Bible in it to bring to church the next day. She hadn't even gotten out of the car before the handle ripped out at the seam and she was just holding it. Nothing extreme like swinging it around (like she has been known to do!) Terrible terrible quality! I forgot to return it in time, so I'll try sewing it back together, but we were very disappointed in it!",0
5,nice wallet,1
5,Love this! Perfect for my Halloween costume.,1
1,Crystal came out of one earring atready.,0
1,"these face masks that I bought for my grandson is absolutely not what was pictured,<br />Doesn't look anything like the product I thought I was buying",0
5,Great product and price. Fast shipment.,1
1,Construction is terrible!! The metal tab at the end for the red belt came off after the second time I wore it. The &#34;keeper&#34; for the Blue belt is misaligned and will not close correctly. Buy these belts only if you are going to wear them once and you like to waste money.,0
4,Item runs small didnt fit my 36 DD chest. Pretty though.,1
3,"This dress is way big. I ordered 3T-4T, my daughter is 4 and this is more like a 5T. The length is almost to her ankle. The material is like rayon. It is a cute dress but the sizing is off. It's not see through so that is a plus. Maybe next year.",0
1,"No me gustó el vestido, la tela no es buena para ese estilo de vestido , malos acabados y muy grande",0
1,"These are very cheaply made masks. The edges are not finished...raw material that will fray in no time. There is no pocket to add a filter for any protection, for ornamental use only. It is very lightweight material and not a good value.",0
5,Obsessed with this jacket. I wear it almost every day! It's super comfortable and just the right amount of warmth for Florida. Basic but great,1
5,Nice fleece,1
1,"poor finish, clear plastic map fell off the first day.",0
5,Insanely well for the price.,1
3,"You get what you pay for. The fabric is a nonstretchy cotton with no give. Carter's tends to run small and narrow, in our experience. Our five and a half month old son is quite large for his age, such that he has pretty much outgrown these PJ's in the 9 month old size. We can get him into them, but zipping them up around his large thighs is tricky.",0
5,Like it alot.,1
4,"I like the fabric, the fit is good. However I expected the color to be a little more on the &#34;nude&#34; tone and it feels a bit more grayish to me.",1
5,Beautiful detailed key chain. My kids loved it!,1
5,I buy tree bans<br />Dos for the price of one !! Nice colors second time buying this product.,1
1,Not a fan,0
4,This Was A Gift To Someone And They Loved It,1
2,Fit very awkwardly,0
5,"Soft material, cute patten with bright colors.",1
1,"While initially I thought this was band great, six weeks in and the color coating is coming off. This is mostly where the magnet attaches but you can see from the other photos that it is happening all along the edge of the band. It is difficult to see with the photos so I circled the areas.  One of the little pins that you use to attach the band to the Versa also broke off and made getting the band off very difficult. The band is also not as shiny and bright as in the ad.  I guess you get what you pay for. :(",0
5,fit great on 2019 1000 4 turbo s,1
5,"I am in LOVE. Bigger than expected, but I am also pregnant, so I love that roominess. Soooo comfortable!!!! I want to buy 3 more!",1
1,It’s literally shorter than my sports bra when I lift my arms up,0
3,Small.,0
5,"All tell ya, the second the neighborhood kids saw these they just had to have them. I almost sold out within an hour. I bought them for workers who worked in tight spots and needed any kind of light that was not hand held. Well, they never made it to the workers. Guess I'll have to order more!!!",1
2,The bag I bought seems like it was already used; it had gross grease(?) smudges on it.<br />Even if it wasn’t nasty I would have returned it since it felt really flimsy and the bottle pocket is way too small.,0
1,"Doesn't really look like the photo, really cheap and there's no cape like in the photo. Misleading.",0
5,This was an addition to a tradition that a friend and I have had since 1996.  We send a ball to one another to keep for the year.  He's an Indians fan and I a Cubs fan.  This is now an addition to our tradition.  Shipping and price was great.,1
5,"So normally I don’t do reviews but I thought it would be necessary for those considering buying this item. This item is perfect! I ordered the blue color and it is super pretty. The bag has a lot of space, with a lot of compartments and it is very sturdy. I ordered this bag to use for my son but I like that it doesn’t even look like a diaper bag so anyone can use it! I highly recommend.",1
1,"Bought a large, I'm a 38B it's not even a close fit. Sad",0
5,This is soo cute! Perfect for my  galaxy 7 and a few other items.,1
1,This shirt was ganas maid poro<br />Its not good material<br />It also was itchy material<br />Poor Poor,0
3,"The reviews were hit and miss, I'm am somewhat large 3x'ish and I've been looking for a poncho. As one person started its very thin. For some reason I thought this would have closure or wear more like a cape. There was hardly enough fabric for me to toss the front portion across my shoulder, as I sometimes like to wear my capes or open ponchos. I wouldn't purchase again. I've worn it twice, but it now is tossed in the back seat of my car.",0
5,I love this I can warranty it to work ... I can wear in out on a date ...  It comfortable cute and makes me look great,1
1,Did not resemble fit and look in picture.,0
2,"So back at Christmas time my boyfriend bought this shirt for me in a medium and it was like I painted it on. So, I went and bought it in a large and it is way to big. I'm the same size as in December and the other shirt is still to tight.",0
1,"I bought this watch 8 years ago and loved it, I was just looking to replace it and this was the only seller I found.  When the watch arrived it looked beautiful, just like mine 8 years ago but when I tried to fix the time the winder just came out. I had to take it to a watch repair place to fix the entire winding mechanism. I ended up using the parts from my old watch and the repair was only $7, hardly worth a return.<br /><br />I just wanted to warn all future buyers, I was sold a broken watch.",0
4,"I actually really like the small size of this, it is very delicate. Don't expect a statement piece with this one, the ""dots"" are 2.5mm at best. My wrists are on the smaller side so the tails were a little long for my taste. I just knotted them and cut the rest off. Just used a little super glue so the knots wouldn't come undone.",1
1,"I purchased the backpack and pencil case for my 9YO to carry her books to school.  She has used it for 3 months (Sept. 19th - Nov. 9th) and one strap has detached and the top loop also broke on the backpack.  This product is poorly made and will not hold items without breaking. I am hoping the seller will replace or refund my purchase based on this feedback.  Will let you know what happens.  In the meantime, DO NOT purchase this backpack as it will not hold up and is not a good buy.",0
5,Fits great and is comfortable to wear!,1
2,"It was the correct color, but other than that, the sizing runs small. Dont expect to get a big cozy sweater in a size xl unless youre a small person. Also, the material is super thin so its more like a long sleeved shirt rather than a sweater. And the shipping took forever to get to california!",0
4,Great colors and prints. Slightly hard to get fastened,1
1,"EDIT: I’m absolutely heartbroken to say after only 2 washes on gentle cycle this dress is pulling badly 🙁 I love the style so this is such a disappointment!<br /><br />_______________________________<br />Ok so this dress was so much better than I expected. The material is thick, but has great stretch, so it really hangs from the body in a flattering way. I got the red, it’s a gorgeous color. The dress has a double v neckline, so it’s in front and back. One side is a little deeper v, so you can decide which side you like to wear to the front better - there a no tags indicating which is the back. Love that. It’s great over a bathing suit, around the house, or throw on some statement earrings and a cute pair of sandals for wearing it out. So many compliments!",0
5,Fit and Finish are good. Sizing seems to be true. So far so good.,1
3,Very comfy but short in length,0
2,Fabric is very stiff. Cute but not comfortable,0
5,"My town went plastic bag free so we needed bags to take around with us when we shop in town, and these are perfect. We are finding that we just all of the bags inside of one of them in the trunk of the car so that we don't forget it and end up having to buy a paper bag at checkout. The bags are exactly what they say, it's a nylon like material... it's not sturdy as it's a soft fabric but i don't need it to be... it's going from store to the car to the house... not making a journey with them.",1
2,the elastic wasn't strong enough to keep the socks up.  They kept falling and bunching under my foot after only a little walking. I won't be able to use them..,0
5,They are a great fit and so comfortable— wore them all day the first day and no problems,1
1,"ordered a M, got a S",0
5,"I found this band very useful. Not only did it come with everything you need to change the bands. it came with the block, hammer, and pins you need to shorten and change out the sections of the watch band. It is very versatile, and comfortable to wear all day. I also like that it came with a glass screen protector. I will be looking at this company for all my future watch band replacement needs.",1
5,Super cute! Love it alot❤,1
5,Great fit.,1
5,Bought this dress on impulse because it was so cheap but had pretty low expectations. It fits just about perfect and the material is so soft. It's pretty flattering and I think it will end up being quite versatile. Very glad I bought it.,1
5,Love this!!,1
1,Was cheap looking. Had a plastic look to the faux leather.,0
3,I love these earrings but their a little thick looks weird on my ears,0
1,Just another piece of crap from Amazon.  Watch feels cheap and the band squeaks as you walk.  It's way too big around your wrist. I usually have to take a few clasps out of my watch bands but this was by far the most difficult band to work on.  After being disappointed  by the products I received from Amazon countless times  i've decided to shut down my Amazon prime account and take my business elsewhere.  Everything from oil paintings on canvas to  baseball caps to wristwatches  have left me disappointed.  Life for us human beings is tough enough. Amazon used to be one of those pleasurable experiences after a rough day.  Now it's just an example of what's wrong with our country.  Don't be fooled shop wish.com instead.,0
4,"Good shoes, but keep in mind that these shoes will stretch as you play.<br />Buy a size small that is tight fitting.",1
5,"It looks really cute on my grandson. Well worth the price and good value, too! Kind of dressy look. Love it!",1
5,"Great liking watch. Fits great doesn't feel cheap, can't tell the difference between this and $100 competitors.",1
5,"I ordered the Chambray blue polka dot/red pinstripe set and I LOVE them! They have a gintage/look and feel to them.. The fabric on the ones I ordered is almost like a denim material, so instead of being stretchy all over it has a stretch band in the back and a tie in the front.. My little girl is 2 years old and at first I was concerned that it would be a little too tight, but it ha's just enough room and she kept it on for just over 2 hours, which is a record for her LOL. It really stayed put! 5☆ product, very well made and I will definitely consider getting a few more in different colors!<br /><br />**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A STEEPLY DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW**",1
5,very nice,1
5,Perfect hat! Covers the back of my neck when gardening. I tie the straps around the back to make it adjustable.,1
5,Love this shirt. It’s cute true to size and does moisture wick your sweat all for an affordable price.,1
5,The airflow on the side prevents fog which is brilliant.,1
5,Great fit,1
1,"I ordered a beach tent for my family vacation, and I'm pretty sure this dress was made of the same type of fabric. Cute style, but I can't actually imagine wearing it. The fabric is horrible.",0
1,Too complicated to use. Didn't like the quality and the silver part that holds the belt broke.,0
3,"I have been using this headband for running and for yoga.  It does a great job of keeping my hair back and away from my face and on only mildly chilly days, it works great for keeping my ears just a bit warmer.  It's not the type of headband you want to keep your ears warm on a very cold day.  After washing it a coupe of time, it seems to have shrunk just slightly.  It's not enough to affect the fit on my head, but it's enough to pucker the seems just a bit and make it set just slightly wrong.",0
5,They are very cute and my 2 year old Granddaughter loves them. They are exactly what I was looking for at a good price.,1
2,"Im 5’6”, 180lbs .. and it fit like a long shirt/tunic .. not like a dress. Dress is very cute but fabric was a bit thin and stiff .. wanted to love it but had to return it.",0
1,Very cute dress and good material. Don’t buy if you aren’t an XS though.<br />I got the XL and it wasn’t even close to size.,0
5,This bracelet is so pretty and the quality is very good for the price.  Love the princess cut and the size of the czs are nice.  Would do business again,1
5,"what a great, cheap everyday gift. :)",1
1,This runs very small. Order the next size up!,0
5,These earrings are great!  They are not heavy at all & go with lots of outfits!,1
4,A nice lacy look! Happy with roomy fit!,1
5,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,1
4,"These pants are adorable but if you’re looking for a classic “fold-over” or comfy waist, this is not it. There is a super tight elastic strip at the very top that detracts from the comfort and “looseness” as they were described. That being said, they do look really good and I still wear them higher up on my waist as regular pants instead of lounge pants.",1
3,I was using it as a mail opener it last about two months before it broke.,0
1,"nothing in the sleeves to loop up with the metal loop on the outside elbow. also, very frumpy. fabric is rough and see through. do not rec. sorry :/",0
2,I ordered 00 and they seem a bit small.,0
5,Sturdy set of 3 shoe horns. They work great. Good quality and good design. Exactly 7 inches long. The only other thing that I might note is that the base of the shoe horn is narrower than I would have liked. I would have liked the shoe horn to be slightly wider. That is a personal subjective observation. But the shoe horn works great. I give it five stars. It is long enough to be useful but short enough to carry it around for travel.,1
5,This bag is glorious.,1
2,"I read great reviews about this product beforehand but when it came to me, the sizing was very small and the leggings were not as soft as I had hoped. I had read other reviews saying that their leggings did not turn out to be the same as the reviews here so that might be my situation right now. I was expecting soft yet supportive leggings but mine came in smaller than I expected and also shorted than I had expected. It might just be my pair because I do not know if the other pairs are like this.",0
5,"Haven't worn this yet, but I really liked the material. It's light. I plan to wear this for a party with a light sweater, perfect for fall or spring.",1
1,I wish these were more true to size.,0
1,Nothing good about that product,0
1,I do not recommend wasting your money on this jacket. Very thin/flimsy material & the zipper broke the very first time I wore it. Try the Regna brand if you're like me & wear these jackets to the gym...will last & fits much better.,0
5,Love!,1
3,IT WAS OK,0
2,This shirt doesn’t look like it does on the model. It is large and shapeless. It hangs all wrong. I am 5’8 and 140 lbs and the large is what I normally wear. This was just awful. The material felt cheap and was not soft.,0
1,These are small.  I bought for my grandkids between 4-10 age.  My 4 year old can wear but to small for rest.,0
1,Horrible quality. The shoe lace holes tear down and the metal rings snapped on the second time I put the shoes on. I do not recommend buying these shoes unless you want something that lasts less than 5 wears. See picture.,0
3,Sizing not as described took one size up and still too small arms cut too deep if taking one size up.,0
2,"I ordered 2 pairs of size 8-9. Only one pair was the correct size. That said, these slippers are attractive, but they are not durable.",0
1,These gloves are NOT WATERPROOF WHATSOEVER they are hand sponges. Just soaks in the water and retains it while your hands freeze.,0
3,"I liked the comfort , length too short ..",0
5,Love it- plenty big- love shoulder strap-- color is awesome,1
4,Luv the same print on back and front.,1
2,"Cute glasses, I really liked that they had progressive and blue light filtering lenses, BUT there was so much distortion I couldn't wear them. It was like trying to read under water. Bummer!",0
1,This was not a real Ravi Nova mask.  Ill fitting cheap material with no liner.  Do not buy.,0
2,"I returned this item, did not look anything like the picture and it was too small.",0
1,I am so disappointed in this dress!  The front center seam is coming unsewn - about 10 inches in the front middle of the dress.  The fabric is thin and flimsy.  The  quality of this dress is awful!,0
3,The heel runs down fast.  Not to be worn a lot and they smell.,0
5,Nice,1
2,"I purchased this bag at the end of March and after only a few months all the interior pocket seams have come apart and torn. I'm losing items in the lining of the bag through the holes in the pockets which is infuriating when I'm trying to find something. The interior pocket has no structure so it's useless, contents just fill the other part of the bag. One of the exterior seams is coming undone on the outside and has a big hole now. Terrible quality and construction. Too bad, I really liked the look of the bag and it felt right when carrying around which is why I'm giving it a 2 and not a zero.",0
3,"Item is ""ok"" I was just dissatisfied with the prints that were shipped. Most of them are odd colors that maybe better for a child to wear. Most went to Goodwill unopened. I guess I should have just opted for choosing a print for an increase in price.",0
1,"The idea is a good one and I would like to see someone come up with a better way to handle the sweat and chafe problem.  But this product is not good for it.  The placement of each piece (and they are separate, they don't go around the back) is uncomfortable even with the correct sizing.",0
1,So upset it was broken in 3 places.,0
1,Very disappointed.  I'm a very solid size 4 and ordered a medium.  It's way too small and looks funny on. The top is sheer and a shirt has to be worn underneath it in order for it to not look cheap.,0
5,I have bought multiple items from this company now and have never been disappointed. Love the pockets! Love the material! Overall great products.,1
1,No spring hinge on the glasses I received.,0
5,"love it, and I am wearing it today at work!",1
2,"Very flimsy, not strong enough for my daily use.",0
5,"What a great bag!  I'm so happy that I ordered this bag.  The quality is amazing!  There are four different colors/styles to choose from.  I picked the one that is considered &#34;white&#34;.  There is also navy blue on the bag with a cute floral print.  The handles are long and sturdy.  The bag is a great size.  You can use it for pretty much anything.  There are a lot of compartments to store small things as well as a very nice button and loop for the closure.<br /><br />I have deemed this bag my &#34;work bag&#34;.  Anything I need for work I keep inside the bag and take it with me daily. I travel a lot for work locally and it's the perfect size to hold things I need to get through the day when I'm not at home or the office.  It has almost replaced my purse.  I'm very happy with this bag, it's also perfect for gift giving as well. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I have received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.",1
3,"Well made, I feel that it doesn't hold what I needed it to. Larger would have been better.",0
1,Material was super thin. And not what i expected for the price i paid. I returned immediately.,0
5,"Bought this for my 6 year old great grandson to pair with the wrangler camo shorts.  This is a gift so not sure what they will look like, but they match really well. Very pleased.",1
5,Just what I needed!,1
4,The paint chipped,1
2,"I like the texture of the shirt and wear It to the gym. However, i ordered the fuchsia and it’s not as pictured. It’s neon pink. I’ll still wear It but definitely not the color pictured.",0
5,I like it,1
4,"These came a lot faster than the estimated delivery date (I mean, almost two months would we ridiculous).  I bought these knowing very well they could be very cheap, since &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  I was pleasantly surprised with these sunglasses.  When I first got them, I had to bend them a little bit, as they were crooked.  They bent very easily and now fit well.  They are cute and do not feel cheap.",1
5,"I gave the socks for a gift to a friend Who has circulation problems and swelling.  After trying several brands with the same effect, he reports these socks make a big difference in the pain and swelling all day.  Best compression hose by far.",1
4,Gift for my son as he gets ready to graduate and enter the work force.,1
4,"Cute top, the fit is great too.  I ordered this in a medium the color was brighter than I anticipated.  I ordered the gray top as well and the color is perfect.",1
1,Very misleading product description.  The shoe is only available in a Size 6!  Returned it.,0
1,cheap quality,0
4,"A little large in the cup, but I need the extra help.  It is very comfortable, and the straps don't slip off my shoulders like my other bra's. I am careful how I wash them though, seems like the outer cover may loosen some. Other than that, they really are my favorite bra.",1
5,Love,1
5,"At first when I got these I thought they were dangly earrings! Which I'm sure they could be used for that too! Either way, they're just as the picture had shown and very cute!",1
5,"Nice bag, but larger than I needed.",1
5,"It's built like a tank and looks like it could cost several hundred dollars. What a deal if you like big, bulky masculine looking watches. I've only had it for two weeks and already have had compliments from my friends. Biggest bang for the buck I've ever seen in a diver's watch. Buy it!",1
1,These are flimsy and size isn't accurate.  They all stretched out to the point they were too large.  Not worth the money atvany price.,0
5,Bien en la talla,1
4,"I have been looking for substantial sweats/fleece, but keep find light weight, flimsy ones that would not keep a bear warm and that don't last very long.  I certainly could not find anything even approaching what I wanted in women's clothing.  I began looking in men's clothing and found more of the same in mind numbing search ...<br /><br />I found this shirt.  It is a nice sturdy medium weight with well constructed seams.  It washes without noticeable bleeding, fading, or piling.  That it came in purple was a plus as I could wear it to my grandsons sporting events.<br /><br />The reason for 4 rather 5 stars is that it is pricey.",1
2,Was supportive,0
5,"Love these pajamas! They are cute and comfortable, but also keep me cool in the summer, but warm enough in the colder months. A great bonus is the pocket for your phone. Was wonderful to have while feeding a baby in the middle of the night or early morning hours.",1
5,"Super lightweight, had compartments inside and out",1
3,"Very pretty dress. Length is wrong. I’m 5’5” and ordered a medium. Top fits beautifully and I’m ample chested :-s ...DDD...but the length of the ruffle part hits me under the knee - not midi, not maxi, just meh. Wish it were either a little shorter or a little longer. Can’t wear keds or sneaks with this or it looks like a short house dress LOL",0
5,"These are my favorite shoes! They are so different and fun. They can get a little painful after a long day in them, but thats as expected with most heeled shoes.",1
1,Very thin jersey material that sticks to you and gets sucked in your mouth when you breath.  I would not recommend this mask.  Cute idea though with a different material.,0
5,"This band is very soft and well fit for our fitbit,so many holes give your wrist more room to breathe.I would definitely recommend this band.",1
1,"Item was delivered damaged with a snag/hole, as well as a tuffed area like it had been hit with velcro...not happy!",0
5,Love these. They fit my 1yo and keeps him warm,1
5,Wonderful to be able to organize all my rings.,1
5,"Usually wear an XL, ordered an XL and it's just right for me. I am 5'2"" and it comes down to my mid calf, which I like because most dresses are too short really and it's hard to find this length. Fabric is not see through, but not so thick as to be heavy. Very comfortable, love that the sleeve ruffles give it that extra interest.",1
1,It doesn't keep time. It's a piece of junk.,0
1,Awful. Not what is pictured but I made the mistake of not buying an amazon seller,0
1,The pants are loose fitting. Its not made fitted like the actual picture. My daughter never wore it because of that. I should have returned it.,0
5,This is a gift for a friend that is taking flying lesson an is color blind. This will help him see all the colors From the air as I have over the years.,1
3,"I was excited to purchase this product bc the style is cute. I'm 5 ft, weigh about 90lbs. The product stated it'll fit a skinny person or for junior, so I got a small. When I tried it on, the top was fine.  The bottom, however, was loose. If it was an x-small, it would have been better. Overall, this was OK. I'll only be able to use the top.<br /><br />I got this product at a discounted price. It did not  affect my opinions/make me bias.",0
5,"They are not heavy sweatshirts, actually not a sweatshirt at all.  Light weight shirt.",1
5,Very fashionably fine and is the best eyewear protection from sun rays.,1
3,Not the same shirt as in the picture.,0
2,First day that I wore them they lasted all night and when I went to wear them the second time my heel broke before leaving out thank God I wasn’t outside at this point the color itself is very cute and the shoe was actually comfortable but the quality is really cheap. I’m 5ft 1 in and weight 150. I mean I’m not that big for my heel to come off.,0
4,Very nice product for the cost.  Would buy again if needed.,1
3,super cute bathing suit.  i'm 5'5 and 130 lbs.  bottom fits great but the top was way too large in the small I ordered.  if you're small chested the padding isn't in the right places to enhance your breasts.  definitely more flattering for full B cups or larger only.  since i ordered with prime it arrived quickly and on time.,0
1,Ordered a size larger than I normally would have because I wanted a very loose fit. The dress was loose which was what I wanted but it was wayyyy too short. I have to wear it with shorts to prevent flashing everyone and the belt ripped apart the second time I washed it. I do not recommend this product.,0
1,Not at all what I was expecting. The fabric tore on the first time wearing it,0
5,Very cute and dainty,1
5,Beautiful! And fit like a glove!,1
2,a little cheap,0
4,It was me very well and it fits me as well as the expected love her body is so big disproportionate and sometimes t-shirts or a little bit weird this one fits me just right just as I expected would definitely recommend it,1
2,Beautiful and lovely but the sizes run very very small. Requested a refund and NO RESPONSE. What a waste of money. True to the Asian markets. Penny pinching and greedy.,0
4,Really large but works as a nightie!,1
5,"This is the best Halloween decoration. It scared everyone, I love it.",1
5,"I was hesitant about this top only because I thought it would look better on someone in better shape then I am. But, I loved it and got so many compliments! It’s stretchy and the tie around the neck is stretchy too so you can really adjust it.<br />I was able to tuck it into my jeans so it looked like a bodysuit without having to worry about snapping it after I pee.😂<br />I ordered an XL (5’3” 180lbs 38DD) and could probably do a L, but I did not want it super snug. There is also another layer on the boobs, so you could wear it without a bra if you have the right boobs. I’ll be ordering in more colors!",1
5,Great material!,1
3,Runs small,0
3,I was not happy with my order. when the package got here I was happy to get it but then I was really disappointed that the ring in the set was broken upon opening,0
5,[[VIDEOID:9fbfc916a0a3deb0c2d31fb0ab1ee84e]] Just put it on and need to wear it in. I bought the brown one so I know I will be very happy with this black one!!!,1
5,Really look pretty,1
5,Arrived much earlier than quoted. Great quality & super cute.,1
5,"Fit my wife perfect, she loved it and she looked great wearing it.",1
5,Great fit,1
3,"They do the job. Took some time for my eyes to get use to for sure. They r pretty large height wise, so if u like that, then u will deff like these. They are a cheaper quality. Like so light and would break easily. For the price they aren’t bad. They work. I do like the white n black print design on them.",0
5,good quality and size,1
5,LOVE my bracelets! Im already wanting to get more haha I dont always have time (yet. im just starting out!) to meditate but just wearing them alone reminds me to stay centered,1
4,"Looks nice, fits well.",1
5,So beautiful... My daughter loves them... True to size,1
1,"Ordered a 4x because of reviews, and received a large which looked like a child’s large. Extremely disappointed. I’m not even sure if the 4x would fit my size 14 body.",0
4,"I like this dress and my husband really likes it.  I read the reviews and customer feedback and decided to take a chance on ordering the small.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs.  But I'm a 34D in the bust, so there is a slight pull on the bust button (even though it's covered -- it's trying to peek out).  If you look on the size guide, you can see I was risking it with the small because I'm right on the S/M threshold.  So, I will order the medium and see if there is a difference.  I'm hoping it won't be too big.  I should have gone with my first instinct and ordered up.  I'm a busty petite, so oddly-sized.  However, I love the high belt -- perfect for petites/those who don't have long torsos.  Love the style, will keep my fingers crossed for the medium.  Update:  the medium is excellent - no pulling!",1
2,"I did not like piecing together all the pieces on the watch… In fact, it is still not put together nor has it been worn",0
4,The item is very nice .I love it .Hope this is good gifts to my friend ! I will update soon when after I will give to her .,1
5,Simple and strong. So glad to have them.,1
3,Thinner than most gaiters.  Arrived with hole.,0
4,"I am normally a medium/large and sized up to an xl for this.. It first pretty well. Probably could have went smaller but didn't want too tight. Cute cut, just the top is littler higher cut then the photo. Will definitely buy more by them.",1
4,"Overall, I like this dress. The pattern is cute, the fit is good, and it has no quality issues. The price is also great for the quality you get. I normally wear a size 12-14 (XL), but I went with the 3X based on the product description, which fits well. The belt it came with barely fits, and I have a relatively thin waist, so it definitely won't fit someone who is stronger in the stomach area. This isn't really an issue though, the dress looks good enough without the belt, and I can wear one of my own with it. The only thing I don't like is the length - I'm 5'7'' and the dress hits a little above my knees, and rides up a little when I sit. I don't really like showing my thighs without tights or leggings, so I really wish the dress was a little longer. I will probably wear it as a dress later on when I can wear black tights and boots with it. I think it will look great with a simple black or navy cardigan.",1
1,Had to return sleeves to short and tight fit,0
3,Thx,0
5,Love this necklace!,1
5,"I love throwing this dress on for super casual things or dressing it up if needed. It’s sooo comfortable. I waited several months for army green to be offered in a small, so glad that finally happened. The only thing I was surprised at was that the gathering happens right below my “chest,” whereas on the model it doesn’t, but I’m sure she’s taller. (Plz offer more modern patterns!) Also, love how modest it is and if you’ve got a belly or are bloated, it covers it up. 👍🏻",1
3,did not like how it fit returned it,0
5,"I have the other color and am thinking about getting another. I lose track of both the time, day and date and I absolutely love this watch, keeps me from feeling so stupid. Have had other day,date watches but hated them.BUY,BUY,BUY IF YOU HAVE MY PROBLEMS.",1
2,"I eventually found the picture in the bracelet, but it took about 45 minutes to do so! It’s cute though.",0
5,Love it!,1
3,The under shirt fits small but the rest is fine.,0
4,"I'm 5'9 and bought a XL.  I usually wear a large depending on fit of an item. To be honest I will always wear this dress open like a kimono jacket with the sleeves rolled up such as in the second pic.  I got a lot of compliments when I wore it as such.  I personally don't find it very flattering in dress form, but I did go up a size so that's a possibility.",1
5,It is pretty,1
3,"My cup size is 34 C.  The C cup size runs small although the 34 inches around the body is fine.  Bra is a bit itchy.  This bra is nice for halter tops and other dresses that are closer to the neck.  This bra stays in place.  I'll wear it when I go out, but not for comfort.",0
5,Very encouraging and beautiful.,1
1,Not close to what picture shows. Weird material and sizing is way off,0
2,"It's cute, but I wore it twice before one of the stones broke off. So for the price, I guess it was worth it?",0
3,Tight fit but well constructed and lightweight.,0
2,"The style is pretty, but if I order red the color should be red, not burnt sienna. Very orangey, brownish red.",0
1,"Cheap feel, the paint came off and stained my wrist. The “leather” came apart after a getting installed.",0
3,"Wish they hadn't folded it in thirds to stuff into an envelope. ..made a permanent crease right in the front.  Color a little duller than pictured.  Otherwise, a cute style and well made straw hat.",0
5,"So well made, cute and looks great on my son.",1
1,What a waste of time. They were too small to fit. Now I have to struggle to get them back for credit. Too many Chinese products at Amazon.,0
5,"I truly LOVE these socks.  They are very nicely constructed, soft, and feel great on my feet.<br />Of course it is cold here right now so they are particularly welcome but I imagine they will be great year round.<br />They fit nicely and do not cut my circulation off so that my feet become swollen at the end of the day.<br />These would make a great gift for someone too.<br />Highly recommended.",1
1,This bracelet is a wish. com  version of an Original MountInspire design. A small business that designed this years ago and sell on Etsy.,0
2,Cute but did not fit well,0
5,These are fun leggings for weight lifting and for running. It’s a different material than the other 2 pairs I have in different colors.,1
5,I adore my new bag. Its super roomy and looks way more expensive.,1
4,I am a Man of many bandanas.,1
3,They’re cute flip flops but unfortunately they ripped after only having them for 1 month. The glue that holds the shoe didn’t hold up to my kid wearing the shoes a handful of times.,0
2,The style of the outfit is great! If the material  was thicker I would keep it. I will be returning this outfit. The quality of the outfit is very thin and super cheap. At best this is a $10 outfit.  The material is transparent and very clingy. Every lump and bump and color of underwear will be seen in this outfit.,0
5,Seems ok spouse ordered and haven't heard any complaints.,1
5,Good gift,1
5,I love this dress 💖💖💖💖,1
2,"Regular photos winter fit if you want to have use the cover to protect the photo. The photo thickness must be paper thin to fit easily into the keychain. Also you must remove the default image that is on the plastic piece that protects the photo, it's not super hard to remove but it doesn't come off easily either. It took some effort and I gave up getting the little dots completely off out of frustration.",0
5,These are good safety glasses. My job requires me to wear wrap around safety glasses. These fit the bill.<br />The ear arms are independently adjustable for length and angle.<br />I can read now while wearing safety glasses.<br />They do not fit over prescription glasses.,1
1,Way too small and way too sheer,0
5,"I got a color I wouldn’t typically get & I’m glad I did because it’s lovely. It’s lightweight, not lined with anything. It fits nicely, just as expected. The strings could be better, they are cheap! But other than that it’s a nice hoodie!",1
5,"Good quality, looks just like in the picture,people often ask where I no go it, not thick material is a light sweatshirt",1
5,very nice grandauther loved it,1
5,"Love it-such high quality and the colors are sharp, vivid and bright-love it!",1
5,So comfy I ordered another pair right away!,1
5,I love purple and so ordered the purple pair.  Have had them a few days now and they work perfectly for my needs.  They cover my glasses and keep the sun out of my eyes as well.  Would definitely recommend them and will reorder if/when I need to do so.,1
5,Its a beautiful bracelets that holds up strong.,1
4,It is a lovely dress.  Beautiful color and vintage style.,1
2,"These pants are super low quality. Not only are they completely see-through (that white underneath is my white biker-short type underwear), but just the way they fall on my body in the legs is pretty cheap and tacky looking. I used the sizing given, and as you can see, they are way too tight around my hips and can we say camel toe ?!?! I do not recommend.",0
1,Turned white gold came off real fast  not good,0
5,Beautiful and just the right size. Packaging is awesome no need to gift wrap!,1
1,Turned yellow within a month,0
4,"Good quality. Feels like a nice t shirt. Is somewhat flattering but really hides everything but also is a little “too” big where it’s hiding it all. The fit is good, but all of the extra material is a lot. With all of that being said, I did order another color because the cons didn’t outweigh the pro- it’s cute and easy to wear with jeans or shorts or black pants for work.",1
5,My girl loves her new gift.,1
1,I wear a large. Had to return them a get xxl. They fit small,0
5,Best Hat ever,1
5,"This jacket is very attractive and felt pretty warm. I really liked it but it was not very flattering on me. I’m pear shaped and I was hoping this would be a nice flair. It was a little too bulky on the midsection for me, but I tend to be very picky about that. I would recommend it to others though!",1
3,"Bought this half off and it was nice looking, it is more of a hoodie/jacket. but i order a 2x. i usually do a XL and it runs big but this one at a 2x was too small to even wear.it's nice but order it big.",0
3,"Not great quality. The eyes look like they could fall off in a strong wind, but it served it's &#34;stupid hat&#34; purpose. Color is true to image.",0
2,Way too big. Wide in my foot,0
1,It fits like some 10-year-old sowed the dress,0
1,Emblem is of very poor quality,0
3,Easy to use,0
4,"The top was extremely true to size, didn’t have any issues with sizing. Material was comfortable and soft and stretchy where it needed to be. The only thing I will say negative is that the color stained the white long sleeve I wore with the outfit. Other than that, the top is a 10/10",1
2,I liked it until it broke. Got out of the car and my keys all fell on the ground.,0
3,The fit was great. Didn't really like the tail on it. It was made from a different type of material. It was still cute on. The tail material was kid of cheap looking. Wish it was made out the same material as top,0
3,I do really like this wallet and it's super cute!! :) So in love with the color. Just as pictured and smooth material. Only thing is not the best if you have a lot of cards (won't really double card a slot which is what my old wallet did). It's also very hard to get the cards out of the slots (not very roomy at all) especially the license slot. What I did was use the money area to keep extra cards in for easy access. Does get stuffed easily but I overall still like carrying it around and using it.,0
3,"The band did not come with 9 holes, it comes with 7. Not as big as it advertised, so it just barely fits me. Wasn't hard to put on but wasnt easy either. When you slide over the little ball, the whole thing slides into the band so you have to put one side in the hole first. The ""leather"" feels and sounds cheap. I get that you're paying 21 bucks for 2 bands, but this just isnt as advertised. The colors do look nice though like the picture. Not too comfortable right now, but I'm going to wear it for a night and see if I will return them or not.",0
5,"I purchased several pair of these last year and just ordered several more yesterday! I love these!!! So comfy, dress them up or down! Great with boots!!!!! Throw on a plaid shirt or a tunic and go!!!",1
1,Horrible and the soles come out,0
5,Husband loves the belt.,1
1,Cheapest thing I have ever seen in my life. DO NOT BUY THIS!!,0
5,It fits the smaller beltloops on my shorts.  The magnetic connector works.  A good value compared to alternatives.,1
5,Very pleased with dress. Will enjoy wearing it when the weather gets warm. Got it in a larger size because I don't like my clothing to &#34;hug&#34;.,1
3,It was a lot smaller than I thought. The clasp also breaks easily.,0
5,Worked perfectly for graduation bracelets for my 8th grade students. They liked them.,1
2,"As pretty as it is, i am trying to figure out why it costs $23? i own bras that are better made that didn't cost that much.",0
5,Sturdy beautiful I get a lot of comment when I wear them,1
1,This product arrived in a ziplock bag with moisture in it and the sweater smells terrible of mold and mildew<br />I will be returning this!,0
5,Oh my gosh!! The top os super cute and flattering as well. The fabric is nice and stretchy.  I also love this color green as well. I had my doubts at first but I'm so happy now that I went through with the purchase! Do yourself s favor and just buy it,1
5,"I'm just not sure about this price!!! At the American Girl store, and on the online store this doll id only $115! This price is too high! But overall American Girl Dolls are fun to play with! (just watch out for over priced dolls!)",1
2,Material is thin.,0
5,Todo,1
5,It works great for keeping the sun out.,1
1,These sleeves are poorly designed and fall off your glasses after you put them on. I placed them snuggly on my frames but the minute I removed my glasses from my face they fell off and were lost. This is another poorly designed product from China that’s a total waste of money.,0
3,"This lighted jewelry box made the necklace I gave a a gift even more special. The way it lit up the item made it sparkle and the recipient also lit up with amazement. The quality was fine and it displayed the item well. My only complaint is that the price was very expensive in my opinion. With a lower price, I would give it 5 stars!!!",0
3,I don't like it.  I can't get it to fit right on my wrist.  The leather is very stiff!,0
5,very warm,1
5,"I really appreciate their service!!! It got here quickly, the piece was beautiful, and they included a thank you bracelet. Highly recommended. I looked through so many necklaces and this caught my eye and I truly love it! Thank you",1
2,"The romper itself is cute, I like the pattern, and the material is nice. I have a pretty big 8 month old, so I ordered 6-12 months. It was huge. The bow on the headband is giant and floppy. I hated that. I’m returning the product. If it had fit well, the romper would be very cute. The headband, not so much.",0
5,Totally awesome . Works perfectly for my 19mm lug width Oris ChronOris Date. Can’t believe the quality fit finish for the price . Also came with extra spring  bars and bracelet removal tool . Absolutely 5 stars,1
5,I wish I had my watch a long time now it fits perfect after being adjusted.,1
5,Came in very handy when I lost the backing to one of my earrings. Thanks for offering the spare parts :D,1
3,These products appear to be inconsistent in their sizing.,0
5,"I was hoping that the pictures and reviews did this mask justice.  They do!  I absolutely love it!  For me it fit comfortably right out of the bag with no adjusting.  It feels really light and easy to breath with.  There are places that are requiring a mask during the Corona Virus. ( I can't find data on what type of masks really do help, but friends and family want me to have one)  I hope this will make people feel safer until there are enough quality masks for everyone? :)",1
1,"The metal bar attached to the piercing is way too loose. You cant keep it in place long enough to secure it. Also, the bar itself isnt long enough to go through the hole entirely.",0
2,"The strands could have been a little thicker, it's thread thin; also came with a weird smell.",0
1,Sizes don't match product,0
5,Beautiful necklace!  I bought the black chain and red gem one but I think this one is my favorite.  100% satisfied!!!! Very nice company too!,1
5,This sweater is nice and warm. I'm so glad I bought one.,1
2,"Beautiful shirt,nice and cool.  The size chart posted shows a kids XL is a 16 but the shirt comes as an XL but a 14.  We needed it for a show so I couldn't exchange it without her wearing it with too short sleeves.  Like I said though very nice quality shirt.  My daughter is very petite 5'1"" and 85lbs",0
5,Loved it.. wear a 24 dress size.. got a 4x so it would be loose.,1
5,"I've had these for months now and I can honestly say these socks are wonderful! They stay on and don't bunch up or slip off. They are very comfortable and keep my slip-on sneakers from getting sweaty and stinky. But, if you're looking for something to wear with ballet flat shoes, these will not work. They will show. I will say after many washings, they do get little pills on them. If that doesn't bother you, then you will like these. Give them a try!",1
3,"I really wanted to love this jacket, but it fits weird and lays funny. It doesn't quite look like the picture. I have a 27 inch waist and the xs was a little baggy. Also it is stiff so thr bottom part doesn't flatter very well.",0
5,"Cute pattern, comfortable fit, casual dress or easy boho fit.",1
1,front strap breaks all the time always repairing,0
1,The shoes were too small!,0
4,"This is a nice simple black crossbody handbag. The material feels pretty solid and soft. It is not the best but it is definitely not the worst either.  It has plenty of room for a cell phone, makeup and a few other odds and ins. The strap is removable and there are two zipper compartments, one being the main and the other on the front side. There is a little pocket on the inside as well. It also had a cute little gift of nail clippers inside. The picture and description are accurate. It is a simple black bag and it would definitely go with a simple black dress or any other casual outfit you choose to wear.  The price is just right and I would definitely recommend it.",1
2,This item was shipped with no protective wrapping of any sort.  It was merely flung into a box unprotected along with a packaged knife and left to rattle around in a huge box with a few gobs of brown paper packed inside.  The item was scratched on the very front surface and appeared &#34;shop warn&#34;.  I wanted to give this gift to my daughter for x-mas but will now have to explain to her why it's scratched - maybe she can make some use of it for something else as it is NOT gift quality at this point.  Fortunately it was not an expensive item so I will not take the time or energy to return it.  I'll just purchase another one locally.,0
1,"This product has a different pitcher then what you actually get.. don't get it.. the back is not Turquoise, its just a pic of plastic.",0
4,"Worth the $, only 2 problems: the pink beads would be MUCH cuter in red, and there are tiny wire &#34;hoops&#34; that scratch your wrist. I think it can be easily fixed with plyers",1
5,"I love this suit, it fits well and is flattering to not so flat stomachs. Well worth the price",1
5,"I loved this pendant when I saw it. It's really hard to find unique animal and gem pendants anywhere, they all seem to look the same now.<br /><br />I was really impressed with this. The size of the stone is big, but it's not tacky looking since it's meant to make up the head of the animal. I absolutely the crusted tail and I get so many compliments on it. It's a really nice piece, it's shiny, looking like sterling but I'm not quite sure if it is. The severity of the eyes and nose on this really make it unique and different, and I LOVE that.<br /><br />I'm highly allergic to nickel, and although the chain that it came on was really nice and solid, it did make me itch after a few minutes so I had to take it off, I'm assuming it contains nickel. The pendant, however, caused no irritation whatsoever! It's such a nice piece! LOVE IT!",1
5,Need to buy all the colors it it beautiful!,1
3,"I ordered this with high hopes but if you are a petite woman, I would reconsider this dress. I'm 4'11 and 98lbs and the smallest size practically fell right off me. Good quality material and a pretty dress but not made for petite women.",0
2,The bags are made in a long time<br />It is expensive...<br />:(,0
3,"Looks great, works great. The problem is that the band is way too long. When you wrap it around your wrist and clasp it into place, the band wraps way longer than other watches do, like all the way to the side of your wrist, and this flap is pressed against your bone all day. It's quite a nuisance and ruins what was otherwise a great watch.",0
1,Wrong photo,0
5,All as advertised,1
3,they were ok,0
1,Ordered a size 7 toddler.  Too small.  Bought the same shoe from different company and that shoe fits perfectly.  No shoe size labeling on the box or shoe.  Returned it.,0
1,molding bar doesn't work. I've had many experiences with decorative grillz and this one is not worth it.,0
5,I love my belt! I'd buy another!,1
4,"The slip is great, good length but I really don't like the material.",1
5,very nice,1
4,Works as expected but it makes the watch look way to larger for me.,1
1,Ripped when. I washed it.. made very cheaply..😳,0
4,"Good quality, but I don't like pajama stitching",1
5,"I really love how this one turned out! It is simple and thin, but the engraving is very professional. The color has not changed at all and I have worn it several times.",1
1,This shoe is not true to size and it is now comfortable to walk,0
5,i bought this about a  year ago and its still holding up. its cute simple and lightweight. Perfect everyday cardigan i was looking for. I would recommend this product.,1
3,"Ordered size 12, we're way too small",0
5,GRACIAS,1
1,Cute but broke after using it once for a very short period of time sadly.,0
3,These are OK,0
4,very good product that does a good job of polishing tarnished jewelry.,1
5,Just as described. Quick delivery.,1
1,"Dont do it. Sorry, but, No.<br />When you get it in the mail, it may present itself as nice and sturdy.. But once you wear it, its almost confusing. Its like, its soft, and it doesn't feel as restrictive and constricted. You can move, bend over and actually eat in it! but at the same time, it defeats the purpose of getting that shape you want. Theres too much &#34;give&#34; and &#34;breathability&#34; that it contradicts what its for.<br />Not only that, but with just a few wears, the mesh started to rip. And the wiring, it poked through and it hurts!<br />I am 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs. I am active. I run, i exercise. But i also love to eat. I have some pouchy-ness in my belly, hence i bought this, but, its just no.<br />I trashed it sadly :( felt wrong to return.",0
2,I dislike the loose garter because it was too big for me only the string that holds!!not too happy for my purchase,0
1,Way too big. Arm holes are huge. Not for a small chest. Ridiculous sizing,0
1,Product was too small and the material was too stretchy,0
1,They don't fit like they show in the picture at all. I wore them once in the house for a few minutes and they slid off my ear.,0
4,"These compression shorts fit well and I really like the fact that there are two pockets. I'm not a huge fan of the different colored seams, but I knew that's what I was getting, I just wish there was an option of the grey and navy shorts with same-color seams to make them less conspicuous.",1
1,"Dress top received is different from advertised. Also, the hems were mostly undone and visibly defective before even opening the plastic wrapping.<br />To top it off, the dress is not flattering — the waist sits in an awkward spot above my natural waist — Too high to cover with a belt. Too low to be cute.",0
1,These glasses feel like either cheap kids glasses or glasses you would find in the dollar store or at a gas station. Super light and bendable they are also too dark for me to see during the daytime and I have greater than 20/20 vision at 20/15. Also I Can’t see gps and my view in driving in general is too dark to bare or drive safely while wearing. Its a I do not recommend rating from me!!,0
1,runs v small,0
3,Unfortunately I am bursting out of my normal size and can't wear this. But if that's not a concern for you then this is an excellent purchase overall,0
4,Muy bueno pudiera traer una argolla,1
5,Perfect fit and very soft,1
1,Now I bought these a while ago and forgot to do anything about it. I could not figure out how to get the backs off or they just gave me a pair that couldn’t separate.  I do not know I should’ve done something at the time but I forgot.,0
1,TERRIBLE! Don’t waste your money on this! I bought this for a date night with my husband and it’s horrible!!,0
3,"Item runs small, also short",0
2,"I loved the size of the bag and the slim storage capability. But after only one use (when the bag was full), the strap ripped out of the fabric, breaking it. I’m not sure I can even return.",0
1,"have purchased twice, and 3 of the 6 have had broken on the left side were the ear piece and the glasses part have broken. must have a week screw joint. sorry",0
3,The actual glasses are nice quality but the lenses have an odd tint to them and they cause....color glares? They are weird and I wouldn’t say I love the odd color of the lenses. Still decent enough to wear though.,0
5,"One of the best jersey's I have purchased. Smooth high quality fabric. Excellent design and stitching. Only one caution, the sizing is way off. Their size 4XL = US size XXL.",1
2,"I love the meshing on these. Very cool detail that exposes just the calves. It's really cute and looks great with a lot of outfits. These are much more high-waisted than I thought they'd be. It looks good with a cropped shirt or one that hides how high they are. It would be hard to wear something backless with these though.<br />They fit alright when I first put them on, a tid bit long in the leg but as the night went on I found myself having to keep pulling up my pants and the crotch kept getting lower and lower. I put them through the wash in hot water and dried them but it didn't help much. I didn't think they'd shrink but I thought I'd try anyways.<br />They're so cute I really want to wear them again but I'm not sure if I want to go through the struggle again!<br />I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.",0
3,"The product is exactly as pictured. They came in super fast & in a nice microfiber pouch! Very pretty & as described, but was too long for my nostril. They may work for others, just not for me.",0
2,"I purchased these for my daughter and she hasn't been able to wear them. The posts are too short for her ears, and she's only 12. The front and back come off making it nearly impossible to get them to stay together. They are sturdy metal though, and the colors are nice. Too bad she won't be able to ever wear them.",0
5,Love it im 5'3 120 lbs with a cup size D. I ordered the small and it fits perfect.,1
1,"These are nothing like the pictures. Huge, cheap, and the stones have sharp edges",0
1,"VERY cheaply made. After looking through the reviews and pictures I ordered thinking this would be a cute dress I could wear this summer, but I was majorly disappointed when I got my package. The material is extremely thin and almost transparent, and has no give to it whatsoever, and the straps are poorly sewed on and crooked. Feels like the same material as a trash bag.  I'm bummed because the design is really cute, but I'm definitely not going to be wearing it.",0
1,"This skirt is huge. I went by the size chart n I could've gotten my normal size. Also, the material isn't what I thought. It feels slick like nylon. Return!",0
5,Versatile to lock my LS2 helmet just about anywhere,1
4,"Casio G-Shock watches, well in my personal experience they are the toughest watches made for the price.",1
3,Expected better quality of material.,0
2,It looks great! However when I received it it was smashed it not it looks messed up I don't know how to fix it very disappointed,0
1,Didnt fit . Went in the trash,0
1,"Only reason I bought this purse was because it looked like it had two pockets on the flap. One on the front and one on the actual flap like the other one I bought had, but it doesn’t. Tempted to return",0
3,i bought a 14 in another dress and it was smaller then this dress.,0
4,Looks great feels great. It's thin but it feels somewhat strong.,1
3,Tight around ankle.,0
5,"Very flattering, the color was exactly like the picture and the dress has not fallen apart after multiple machine washes. It’s now one of my favorite beach dresses!",1
5,"We used the headbands for part of our krewe costume riding on our float in our Mardi Gras parade. Our float theme was So. Korea and we wore them with our masks.  Great price and they came promptly, nicely packaged, pressed and folded.",1
4,Great price for stylish new glasses!,1
1,This article is very small...VERY small. I am not a large person - but it fit very snug and not flowy at all as the picture depicts.,0
5,Nice design/looking,1
3,It wasn't the same as pictured.  Kept it anyway. did not want to have to pay to send it back to China.  Disapointed.,0
5,"I bought a similar ones years ago, and was looking for ones that look alike because a co-worker wanted them, and they turned great and look awesome",1
5,Cute dress that fits as expected. My daughter loves it!,1
1,"Empire waist seam ripped out as soon as I tried on the dress. Also, was much shorter than pictures. Seemed like it would have been super cute and fit well if it wouldn't have fallen apart!",0
5,Cute.,1
5,This is a beautiful delicate necklace.,1
5,"Very nice robe, it's super cute and really soft. We're using it for a pool robe after swimming, and it has held up to being washed a lot this summer. It would make a very nice robe for just about any use though, and with the hood up, super cute. We bought it a little big so he could hopefully use it longer but I think it would fit about as expected for the size.",1
3,"The front seems of these panties dig in really bad on me, very uncomfortable.  Returned.  Doesn't seem like that was a problem for anybody else...  Otherwise the quality of the thong is excellent, material as others have stated a little strange, kind of rubbery but nothing that would bother me.  For reference I am 5'5&#34; 138 lbs. size 8 and the extra large in these fit.  I'm debating between 2 stars and 3 stars... Ahhhh... don't know... 2.5",0
5,The fit was good and it looked great on. I liked the color choices and patterns. I would recommend.,1
5,Nice,1
5,High quality,1
4,"This is the second pair of these that I have ordered.  The other pair was earlier this year in Women's size for my older daughter.  These came in and look true to the pictures.  My daughter loves them and I am satisfied with the quality.  They do not cheap and the quaility is much better than the ones they sell at the local mall kiosks.  The only downfall is that one of the ends on the USB cable has extra rubber on it causing it to be slightly difficult to plug into the shoe.  Otherwise, I would have given five stars.",1
1,"No, it definitely failed my expectations... :((((",0
1,Cheap looking.,0
5,Very pretty pendant. The kyanite is the color of stonewashed denim. Looks great and feels great on!,1
5,"&#34;Item as described, very nice design and quality. Prompt and courteous service.&#34;",1
5,"I LOVE this bag. The instance I received the bag I was blown away. It came in perfect condition protected with a plastic covering over the handles and the bag itself. I first noticed how durable the material was and the stitching is done very well (no frays or odd stitching). The bag has a zipped middle pocket and 2 larger storage areas on either side of the pocket. It has 2 small open top sewn in pockets to the inner front of the bag and a smaller zipped one on the inner back of the back. It holds and exurbanite amount of stuff as I have been doubling it as a purse and diaper bag since it came in.  The color is vibrant. I have gotten a ton of compliments from people on this. People are astonished at the price of this purse. I love purses so much I plan to buy this in other colors to have for my wardrobe.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to others.<br /><br />*I received this product at a free/reduced rate in exchange for an honest and completely unbiased review. If you have any questions, please ask and I will answer to the best of my ability. If you have found this review to be helpful, please feel free to let me know. *",1
5,love it,1
2,Large is more like a medium.,0
5,Bought as a gift.  She LOVED it!,1
4,I loved the print.  It was a little snug for my liking.,1
3,Not so good for work. Hits right at waist in a aine fashion. A strong wind and...,0
1,Turns colors real fast,0
1,They need to change the description to item is a SHIRT!,0
3,"Material is not the same softness as it is in the solid green one of same brand that I purchased.  Not as comfortable and does not seem to be the same size even though the tag says they are.  Still fits and it was going to cost almost half the price of the shirt to return it so I chose to keep it, but I wouldn't get any more non-solid color shirts from this vendor.  The material is rougher/stiffer than in my solid green one which has a very smooth feel to it.",0
3,I think it is just me and the way I like thing to fit.,0
5,Worked great for what I needed it for,1
1,Bad quality,0
4,Sizing Is way off so I ordered two sizes above mine. I usually fit into a L to XL so I ordered a 3XL and it fit pretty well! If you want this then go two sizes up your normal size.,1
5,"These are very lovely! The stones are quite nice and the setting looks like high quality jewelry.  A high end jewelry retailer even commented on them saying they were very pretty and nicely designed. Putting them on/taking them off does require a slightly different technique than typical studs, but it's not too much harder than putting on a French hook. I love these - considering purchasing in blue!",1

1,[[VIDEOID:c11d3604abae8c2fb111883da90a1601]] I ordered this sweatshirt for my daughter and it was delivered filthy and worn! I am so disgusted!,0
5,I bought this as a gift for my best friend. Our best friend thing is that we are twins lol The necklace is so beautiful! Great quality! Thank you!,1
2,Was comfortable but not good for safety purposes,0
2,Cute on but didn’t hold up long. The fabric showed wear after wearing it only once.,0
3,Much larger than expected for an XS,0
1,"The item pictured is of a pair of Black Slip-on Nike Shoes, the description is of a Welsh Corgi Reusable Cloth Face Mask. The picture is obviously wrong. Please fix it or take the picture down as it is Incorrect.",0
5,Excellent strap!  Definitely feels secure and I don’t worry about my camera dropping.  The materials are high quality and the craftsmanship is superb!  I really like the style of this strap because I want to mostly shoot landscapes while hiking.  It is a great adventure strap that doesn’t take up much space.  Absolutely recommend!,1
3,I received this necklace in a timely manner. I have not worn it yet but plan to do so with a basic black outfit. The color is more pink than rose gold. Another reviewer made that comment but I did not believe it I guess. But she was correct. it is very pink,0
2,"Bought this specifically for the neck detail pictured, but no matter how I stretch it, it never comes close to looking like what is shown on the model.  In the attached photo, the top image is actually better than it usually looks (often large, loose loops hanging all over the place); the second image is with my shoulders pulled back, unnaturally; the third image is with my hand pulling the shirt down as far as I'm able without damaging it.  Think I'll just cut the detail off (it's sewn into the back of the v-neck) and leave it as a basic, comfy shirt to knock around in.  I will say that the fabric is very soft, but the detail has been nothing but a disappointment.  It's a shame I bought two of them (a charcoal one, as well) ... will have to do the same alterations with that one, now, too.",0
1,"Not the right color, doesn’t look like the item pictured.",0
1,"I should have paid attention to the description because these earrings are super cheap and poorly made. I bought for as a small gift for my BFF and was kinda upset. I should have opened the box first cause I would have returned them, instead of gifting them to her.",0
1,"I ordered the pendant as a Christmas present. It was supposed to arrive three days before Christmas. It finally arrived three days AFTER Christmas. When I opened the package there were two pieces, the charm itself and the ring that goes around the bracelet and no way to connect the two. If this weren't bad enough the pendant did not even look like the picture. The crossbar in the A is supposed to be a tomahawk like the Logo but it was just a plain crossbar.<br />Notified the seller of the problems through the proper channels and gave them over two weeks to respond. As of now I have a useless charm that does not look like what I ordered and no response from the seller at all. Extremely unhappy with this purchase.",0
5,"I love these earrings! Very well made, and clean lines on the design. A very clear treble clef. They are (as clearly described) small, but not too small. I wear them in my secondary holes, and they fit nicely. Very happy.",1
3,Not sure how I feel about this?  I know after I use if on an upcoming vacation,0
3,"So I bought these leggings because I’m 4’10” and wanted a pair that wouldn’t be long on me. The 22 inch inseam reaches juuust above my ankle, so no complaints there. They’re also pretty thick and don’t rip when I have to pull them up.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I ordered my size according to the size chart. Since I have a 30 inch waist, I ordered a large. I’m not sure if I should have sized down but these leggings annoy the heck out of me. They constantly sag, which is NOT optimal for exercise. Even if I don’t exercise, I have to hike them up every time I stand. I’ve never had this issue with leggings before.<br /><br />So my advice is to size down if you’re going to buy these. No one likes leggings that don’t stay put.",0
5,"I have a big bust, and they fit perfectly. Stretchy. Non see through. Comfortable for working out or layering. Moisture absorbant as well. Sizes fit as expected!",1
1,"I purchased this for my Grandson. I washed it and the top stayed black, but all the color went out of the pants and they are now grey instead. They are also not fire safe for any child. These are a piece of junk and dangerous and should not be being sold by anyone. They should be pulled off the market!!<br />Do Not Put your child at risk! Do Not Waste your Money!!!",0
5,Good,1
4,Not true to size. Order one size larger.,1
5,"The feel of the fabric is smooth, the snaps are easy to separate and re-attach.  Made physical therapy much easier so the therapist could apply TENS unit electrodes.",1
1,My daughter tried it on and three of the flowers fell off. They weren’t sewed good enough. Not the greatest quality. Very pretty though,0
5,My nurses loved the bags for RN week,1
4,"This is a wonderful piece of jewelry! It looks really great and it has some nice things like the adjustable string. I really love this product - its very stylish and even a little discrete. I only gave this 4 stars because of one major issue: wear. I've only had this for about a month and there are way too many scratches on it - and they change the texture of it and makes it look bad. I've only had it on for really general usage - nothing that should have scratched it so it isn't the most durable. As for other's saying the string comes loose, that has not been a problem for me. Also, just to note, the picture looks like the pendant is beveled out (looks like its bulging out) when in reality, its beveled slightly in. Also, the metal is a brushed metal, not a solid color metal. But don't worry, I think it looks better than its picture!",1
1,Not stretchy so they don't fit well and the colors are awful.,0
5,Love this headband!!,1
1,Fake cheap plastic,0
1,Came apart soon after wearing it,0
4,Nice and thick,1
2,"The one I received was not like the one in the picture, kind of poor workmanship.",0
1,fit is not good,0
4,It didn’t fit me well but cute.,1
3,"The face of the plug is really disproportionate to the gauge sizes. I got an 8g, and the face of it would fit a 4g, which is fine for people with single ear holes, but I needed this to fit in a top hole.",0
3,They’re not really pink but they’re cute.,0
5,This dress is stunning! Well worth it!,1
3,The bathing suit is pretty. The only complaint I have is you'd better have someone around to help you hook the straps as your putting on the suit the straps become unhooked  and there is no way to hook it yourself with the suit on.,0
1,These might be ok on a bright sunny day but way too dark to be usable for eye protection in combat,0
4,Nice enough. Cute. A little on the bigger side than based on the size chart. Could have ordered medium but worried might be tight.,1
1,Terrible. Looks and feels very cheap returned because it would be embarssing to wear out in public.,0
2,"It was an okay product, I didn't like the fact that it changed after a while, and the cuff kept dropping off my ear. It was painful to adjust the clamp tight enough so it'd stay on. But you get what you pay for.",0
3,These readers are ok. I just find I do not do well with u shaped  bifocals. My focus is never right. I prefer plain readers that I can lower or look over. you might want to see if these work for you,0
3,"While the fabric is nice and soft, it's so thin you can see my underwear through it.  I'll still wear it around the house, but it's unfortunate that it's so thin.  Guess I got what I paid for.",0
3,"Too big, I look like a 90 year old great grand mother",0
3,Warm and soft but color was not as pictured. More of a purple tone than grey and i can tell if you have big hands these wouldnt fit. Luckily i have small hands,0
2,In all honesty the top itself was gorgeous BUT the material itself was gross. I really wanted to keep it but I knew the material was not going to do it for me. I expected a soft material instead it’s that cheap rough material.,0
2,Teva makes great sandals - no questions. They are comfortable and durable. The problem is that they lack any antibacterial covering. Thus after a few week they end up smelling like... Skip this sandals look for another brand.,0

4,I like it so much. The garment is very nice and breathable. I just wish if it were wider around the neck.,1
2,Hard to get earring back through. Not good,0
5,fit perfect and its a kohls item that is so high online cant beat this price,1
3,"The pink color is as seen on screen. They are right around the top band, but inane short and they hit right at my knee and fold uncomfortably. A hole started after about 10 wears at the seam where the padded toe part meets the compression of the midfoot area. I thought they would have held up better.",0
4,They are thick and soft. I plan to wear them around the house to keep my feet warm.,1
4,Not at all comfortable. Not cotton or any other soft material.,1
3,Fits in the bust akwardly if you have large breasts.,0
5,I bought these for gifts. They are beautiful.,1
3,"Do not even try to wear it outside. best as a nightwear. its quite chic but again, you can wear it inside.",0
1,Very cheesy looking and feather bent,0
5,"I bought this for my small everyday carry bag.  I have a bracelet but this suits me much more.  It is easy to hook on something, everything works well and is surprisingly good quality.  Would definitely purchase again!",1
5,[[VIDEOID:ac892a81c93cb247ed36cdc10a0799f7]] I love the scrunchie watch band. It’s comfortable and durable. It black and red which are 2 colors that look great together.

5,nicem and foe the pricem exellebr!,1
1,They broke when I went to put them on. Really disappointed because they are so cute. It was not worth my time to do a return.,0
4,"Just received yesterday. Really like its design, simple but stylish. I'm 5'4, this warmer is up to just below the knee, I wish it could be a little longer.",1
5,Bought these for my nephew and he loves them. They're comfortable on him. He doesn't mind the material or the collar.<br /><br />Perfect for the cold weather in NY. But not too heavy to be uncomfortable when he goes inside. So it's a win. It also helps that they are adorable on him.<br /><br />They are a little big on him because he is in between sizes. But even slightly larger they sit well and we have no complaints. I'm also less worried he will grow out of them completely by the time summer hits.,1
5,Fits good looks nice .but makes phone to slick very easy to drop,1
1,Really bad chain.  Tacky.,0
5,My daughter loves these. Such great colors and patterns and she says they're super comfy.,1
1,"Fit way to small, and made the breast way to perky and to much lift. Looked like two cones  under shirt. No attractive as in photo",0
5,Like the fit although it does not push the girls in from the side as much as I'd hoped that it would.,1
1,They come apart only with effort and the wire can come out in the wrong side. The color is also much lighter than the pics.,0
5,Extremely surprised how great the touch screen works with these extremely warm gloves. Wore them on my motorcycle in 40 degree weather and my hands stayed warm.,1
5,"Love love love these! Yes they are pricey and would buy one in every color if they were half the price ;)). Love the sparkles and get lots of compliments. Have them in eggplant also, that color is awesome!",1
1,It made me leave a star but I wouldn't even give it one. Both of these items I received were broke in several pieces.,0
1,I like the width because I don't like a big bulky watch. I bought one of these a few weeks ago and the face cracked after one day. I didn't remember hitting anything but I figured it was my fault so I ordered another one.  Same thing one day later a large crack appeared all across the face.,0
4,I have a small narrow almond face. I was nervous that I'd look like a bug. But they looks great. Nod to Jackie O.,1

5,"The fit is nice.., it has great ankle support and feels secure underneath you, plus they look good",1
1,Top zipper broke first use had to return.,0
4,Super cute rompers but it runs smaller.,1
5,I think they are great!,1
4,"This is a nice looking, and very comfortable shirt. Lost a star only because the material is quite thin. Bought it for a vacation, it's been washed about 4 times, and seems to be holding up well, time will tell. I normally wear XL but got this in 2XL, and it's is just a tad loose, but is good to have a little extra room.",1
5,Very nice grandkids like them,1
5,"being a retired marine engineer I was required to wear protective eye in many forms. these are excellent for the home workshop, lawnmowing, leaf blowing and other dusty places. They are easily cleaned with soap and water and will last for many uses.",1
5,This is awesome.  It’s very well made and I can’t wait to use it!,1
5,Daughter loves these!,1
5,Great fit,1
1,VERY thin.<br />You can see my fingers thru the fabric in photo,0
5,she was a beautiful unicorn princess. Dress fit perfectly and is very well made. Once she got it on she didn't want to take it off and we are very pleased with the product. Material was of great quality.,1
5,Flowy and cute.  Perfect for summer. I think this will work for basically any body shape.  Very flattering.  Going to order some other colors for sure,1
3,The dress is cute but I had to adjust the straps in the back. They were way to long. There is also a desent amount of side boob.,0
3,A little small,0
3,"Nice fitting, slim case. Raised bevel all around the phone to protect it. Places for buttons are a little stiff, but still work ok. Deducted two stars because I am unable to charge my S6 on my Samsung charging pad. I was surprised, because my other case, which is heavier, two-pieced and not slimline, always charged on the pad. I will just have to charge via the plug while using this case. Overall, I like the case, despite the one hiccup.",0
5,bought as a gift she loves it,1
1,Had to return because the plastic sleeve that the metal jewelry is supposed to slide into was cracked on both of the pieces I ordered.  Complete trash right out of the package.,0
2,Only fit kids hands.  Got these so my husband could wear it when playing with our dog (like they do on Americas Funniest Home Videos).  These were to small for an adult hand.,0
1,Hurts my hands. Not comfortable at all,0
5,Love,1
5,"I'm a little disappointed that I listened to the fatties on here who didn't own up to their correct size. I'm usually a size small and ordered up because I listened to the women who said that this product didn't fit. Big mistake. I'm 5'7&#34;, 155lb, size 34D breast and am exchanging for a size small. If you're a big girl, include that in your review. There's no need to define yourself as something you're not. You're misleading others and should feel ashamed in doing so.",1
5,like colors,1
1,"SO uncomfortable, the bottom is so flat and hard I never wore them. Look cute but not practical at all. Love Steve Madden usually but not these.",0
3,"Beautiful color and design but was too small... I usually wear a men’s L but I buy an XL. Purchased a 2XL so I can wear it like a dress, but it fit snug",0
1,they are nice shorts but I bought them for a medium size man and when I looked at them they looked more like for a small boy.  So my daughter decided she would wear them instead of her dad.  Runs very small.  My daughter wears a size 0 in juniors.,0
5,"Love it!  It's two compartments are good and has a special compartment for a cell phone , it's as nice as it looks .  Thank you",1
1,"These pants are adorable , however the sizing is terrible . If you are above a size 10 do not buy , they will not fit especially if you have larger thighs and butt. The material is kind of stiff .",0
3,I thought it was going to made if bone. It feels more plastic that anything.,0
4,"Great watch, but the clasp thing isn't super solid, so if latch it onto your belt loop or something and are dancing your booty off, it'll fly off.",1
3,"Larger than what I expected, but okay.",0
5,I love this is so trendy right now and this color is so beautiful! I have no complaints I’m definitely going to get another color. Exactly what I hoped for and I have no regrets.,1
1,Had these rings for 2 weeks and silver plating is wearing off and the copper is already showing through. Not to mention my toes (skin under the rings and toes next to the rings that are touching) are all green! Super cute but wish they lasted.,0
4,"I really like this dress. The fabric is pretty thick. Though it holds its shape really well, it's still soft and comfortable to wear. I've gotten tons of compliments. I would have given it a 5, but the tag has been annoying me today, and I'll need help to get this unzipped.<br /><br />I'm just under 5'5&#34;, 158lbs, and the large fit really well, though a bit tight on my arms, which is to be expected since EVERYTHING is tight on my oddly large arms (we'll call it muscle...).",1
2,"The cups would only fit an A or B size, I'm a D. Also, the lace is very scratchy and uncomfortable. The little shaped cups are great though in my other bras that have modesty shield pockets as they aren't as &#34;flat&#34; as the other brands so, I guess it was worth the price to get those.",0
5,Look rad. My wife loves them on me. Cheap enough to be my beater sunglasses.,1
1,I was very disappointed because they did not meet the deadline.  I needed the product on the due date because I had an event.,0
5,"Love it, but it's waaaaaaay too big lol I don't mind a bit though, really satisfied:)",1
3,"Fits very small, collar is short",0
1,It was sad color was ugly dirty looking would not order again one side shorter I would be ashamed sending this to anyone learn my lesson don't don't order from this place,0
1,Fell apart,0
5,Fits great,1
5,Great for the Boat!!,1
1,Salio totalmente dañado quiero el producto como lo compré en buena condición.<br />Mandar de nuevo.,0
2,it would be much better if it was cheaper. Is comfortable to wear but takes a little effort to get the right fit.,0
5,Love the look / quality totally a great purchase.,1
5,Very cute! Makes a great gift.,1
5,Fun to wear for the 90’s party I went to.,1
5,Material is classy. Fits perfectly. My wife loves it. Will order again in different colors.,1
2,Way too small. Order 3 sizes up. The turquoise material is pretty and the material is nice.,0
5,Ny wife has a thing for  elephants and she hasn't taken it off since we got it.,1
5,"Very nice quality, very secure, price is great",1
3,These frames help keep your mask off your nose and mouth directly but do get moist and need to be removed and cleaned to be comfortable. When wearing masks for a long time they help not feeling smothered.,0
3,"The pink one is great.  I ordered another color and the material and the cut was different and not to my taste.  But if you like the one in the picture, it's accurate.",0
3,It fits but it is a little small for an extra large.,0
1,"I pulled these straight from the package this morning and wore them for maybe 3 hours on a padded chair watching my daughter cheer. As I was leaving a friend embarrassingly pointed out that I had holes all in the back of my leggings. I realize they are cheap, but it would have been nice to wear them a full day at least or even better, more than once!",0
4,"At first I didn't care for the white fill in the links, but then realized I have a lot of clothing accented with white. These earrings are perfect to wear with these clothing items. The earrings are very light weight which I prefer. They are not an elegant style but will work for casual wear.",1
5,Just like I want it!! It light and fashionable. I am playing to buy another one for my sister!,1
1,When I originally saw this shirt the embroidery showed that it was black that's one of the reasons I purchased it. When I got the shirt embroidery was white and I don't iron who does that too many wrinkles so I washed it and dryed it and still too many wrinkles. We are in 2018 no I will not buy anymore. Oh it also showed that it had black pearl buttons??? So very disappointed because that was another reason I liked it I prefer the pearl buttons on my western shirts.,0
5,Great hat very patriotic made well fits well AAA +++,1
5,These two also gifts so I hope the person likes them,1
2,"It's one size for several different pin sizes (16-22mm; ergo the actual band width is only 15mm wide, which is pretty thin looking on 40+mm watch faces.  Additionally, if you have like 8.5"" wrists; depending on the size of the watch, the fit can be a little tight..?  Overall it's still a decent twist-o-flex.",0
1,"This took a very long time to arrive, and then the stone was not a tiger eye, but a cloudy brown stone.  I was pretty skeptical because of the price, so my skepticism was just confirmed.  I would not order from this company again, and if I was you, I wouldn't waste your time/money on them either.",0
4,"It looks nice, but not my style",1
5,Product as described and works as it should. Quick ship!,1
1,The carabiner is shaky and cheap. I bought this and wanted something else but when I went to return they made me pay for the shipping and were gonna refund me like 3$ after cutting out 6$ for return shipping.,0
1,Spring broke.,0
1,They were too long based on the size chart. They didnt help at all.,0
2,Very small arrow!,0
2,The fabric of this shirt looks nothing like the picture.,0
5,My mom has had 3 pairs of these and they are got old and broke after 15ish years of almost constant wear! She was so happy with her new pair and she loved the yellow.,1
3,The ones that worked were great! a lot were duds but the majority worked.,0
5,Beautiful,1
2,This item was not even remotely what's pictured. Way shorter not the loose neckline that's pictured definitely don't recommend.,0
1,Ordered normal size and my foot would not even go in them. Way to small. Seller issued partial refund for ill fitting item. Buyer beware. If you can't try them on it will cost you 50.00 to try them. Robbery.,0
5,"I wear this as a top with a cami underneath. Great look with jeans, leggings, or shorts.",1
5,2 for 1,1
5,These glasses fit nice and snuggly (no too snug).  The +200 that I need work very well.  I can read fine print that I have a hard time seeing.  I'm 20/20 near vision but awful at the reading range.  I can read up close with these glasses.  Very pleased and would recommend.,1
2,"It doesn't work properly, even if I set it on time it get itself a few minutes behind from actuak time",0
4,"Received 2 pieces, and they are exactly what I paid for.  Just wish they were a little longer in length,  but it's nice to have a gold tone and silver tone to match different outfits or accessories.  They do seem rather delicate.",1
5,"Husband's new fave lounge shorts! Soft, good weight without being too think or heavy for Arizona summers.",1
3,"The last button stops well above the belly button, literally like right below the breast line (where my index finger is, on the second pic). The shirt gapes open when tied, because their should clearly be like 2 more buttons on this shirt, but there isn’t. The shirt itself is cute, but the manufacturing is dumb. I don’t know who thought this shirt was okay, with the buttons stopping where they do. Prepare to have to safety pin the shirt closed, as you can see from my pics; I pinned it, but you can still clearly see that the shirt is open",0
2,"If it wasn't for the zipper that constantly gets stuck in the middle I would give this arm sleeve a higher rating. This sleeve fits in my forearm well and for the most part stays in place throughout the day, holding cash, my cards, and license. It does come in handy when I don't want or can't carry my wallet. Good for boating and going out on the water.  Also, it holds flat keys well, like house or car keys, but my phone is too large to put in the sleeve comfortably. The material the sleeve is made of is not as breathable as I had hoped, and actually feels kind of warm while wearing it, but I could get used to it. The issue with the zipper is caused by a factory defect, and many times it causes me to get frustrated trying to open or close it up. Even so, I will be using this product for my recreational time out on the water.",0
3,"It is beautiful, but the chain twists very easily and I can't seem to keep it straight.  It is the perfect length and the pendant is very pretty.",0
2,"Was great for one wear, then after a hand wash and hang dry, became deformed and un-wearable",0
3,Fits well. Not very thick. The decal is cheaper quality than I expected. More like an iron on.,0
2,No rhinestones on the shoe.,0
2,"Son, was disappointed because he thought the T-shirt was cotton but received a Nylon type of T-shirt. This T- shirt would be better looking on cotton rather than Nylon.",0
1,the clasp doesn't stay closed and the mechanism broke after 5 months .,0
4,Really pretty. I am currently 3 1/2 months pregnant and really want to purchase clothes is can wear during and after baby. I wore this when I was not showing and it looked great. I got a ton of compliments. I would definitely recommend this dress!,1
5,My toddler loves them,1
2,This was a pretty purchase but I couldn’t wear it. Even on the longest setting I couldn’t secure it.,0
3,Super cute but didn't fit was very tight and hot glue strands were hanging off everywhere took a few minutes but I fixed it and it looked fine just small.,0
5,Given as a Christmas gift. He loves it. Plenty of storage. Great looking leather.,1
5,worked great with 5-year-olds roller blades because he says they're &#34;super fast&#34;,1
3,"It works well, it's kinda poorly built, plus the the breath fogging. But other than that it's my day to day.",0
1,Cute but arrived in package that says damaged and are stained wouldn’t buy again,0
5,"Great size, super cute",1
5,Nicer than I expected,1
5,Good,1
1,Not flattering. Too big. Not what the picture shows at all.,0
5,"Well design, and awesome! Everyone I’ve meet has given me wonderful compliments about the jewelry!!!",1
5,"For the cost it is a great deal, I use it to put my camp clothes in and it reduces the volume by close to 50%.",1
3,"Runs small, I ordered a 2XL and that fitted me too tight but otherwise the hoodie has a great design I like the looks of it, just wish it didn’t run small. Also it’s pretty thin maybe best used as a windbreaker",0
5,"Soft cotton fabric, nice fit.",1
1,"This shirt is way too small, will return immediately",0
5,On time and looks good on me,1
5,Gorgeous!  Just what I was looking for as a gift.  A bit large for a very young child but something they will grow into.,1
5,"my son love this watch omg he is always wearing it every where he goes lol,catch seems to talk it off or put it down",1
5,Love this product. It is flexible and so comfortable to wear. Will definitely buy again.<br /><br />Thank you,1
5,I bought this for my Wife (Teacher) to use outside on Sunny hot days while the kids have recess. Theres no shade on the playground. She text me the first day and said it was AMAZING and she LOVED it.<br />I'm very pleased I made this purchase indeed.,1
4,It's a nice ring especially for the price but the sizing was a little off because my husband wears a 13 so that's what I ordered and the ring was too tight so I would definitely go up 1 size when ordering.,1
5,Love it!!!,1
5,"I was a little skeptical when ordering, because a lot of the jewelry on here turns out to be cheap and breaks very quickly but I love the look of this. I'm going on a cruise soon and wanted something cute to wear while traveling. These are perfect. And it actually did come with 2. Although I doubt I'll wear them both at the same time.",1
4,"We used them during GNYEM ( NY DENTAL SHOW) Nov, 2021. They are cute looking and easy to use.",1
5,Perfect,1
4,Nice I like them,1
1,The ball is completely stuck I've tried to pry it out using wrenches pliers my hands nothing will get it out the ring and small black ball came detached and the other one's ball will not stay in!,0
5,"I have this bag in the khaki and the red.  These bags hold tons of stuff and are weightless.  I use the khaki one for carrying files and books and water bottles and lunch to my teaching job.  I've used the red one as a carry on on a plane, and they worked great for both purposes.  Other bags I've had have had more pockets, but I seem to be doing fine with this more minimalist design.  The only downside is that the material can be a bit slippery so you have to watch how/where you lie the bag down or it can slip on the floor.",1
5,"These hair nets are exactly as described, great quality.",1
1,The printed skull face is a lot bigger than my face. ( I'm 6-3 195lbs. ) Also skull is printed on both front and back. Looks dumb from behind. The pictures are misleading.,0
5,My boyfriend loves this product!,1
4,I bought these hoping my 9 year old and 3 year old could wear them. Upon ordering I chose the children's size but the masks i got clearly state adult size. It wasn't a deal breaker for me because i had other masks i had ordered for my toddler in addition to these. My 9 year old can wear them comfortably as can I and my husband. I love that they are adjustable at the ears!,1
5,Very cute and well made. They were perfect for my 6 month old who is crawling everywhere!,1
5,"Fits great! Love how much compression they have! I’m 125 about 5 foot 2, and an xs was perfect! Onto my third pair already 😆",1
3,Comfortable shorts. I liked the feel and look of them but the color red was just too bright for what I was looking for,0
5,Love my band,1
4,"It's small, just the size I wanted for my laptop. It's cool, I really  like the drip effect. Only thing, the drips don't like to stay - I have to press them back down every now and then. But none of them have ripped off yet, so that's good.",1
1,"I am 5'7"", 130 pounds and typically wear a size 6 or 8 in jeans.  I ordered a medium based on product feedback I read.  I could barely get them above my knees and holding them up, I saw they were more capri length.  The fleece is non-existent.",0
1,Dreadful,0
1,Accessing this website will mess up your computer.,0
5,Great value and good duality. Love the neutral colors.,1
3,Appear well made but color is not bright and light as shown in photo. In the photo they appear clear. The back is solid.,0
5,"Extremely soft, and they don’t show in my vans, converse, or sperrys. 100% worth it. I’m not sure how some of the others show the socks ripped, they feel solid but not extremely thick to make your feet sweat.",1
5,Reminds me of my grandma and makes me feel warm every time I see it. Great quality as well.,1
5,"Great quality, fits true to size. Love the print on back.",1
1,Too big,0
1,I am a mentor for a 3rd grader.  He spent Christmas Day in the ER with an allergic reaction to this product that his parent bought for him.  I am surprised it is on the market.,0
5,It turned out beautiful.,1
3,Kind of small. I wanted big oversized glasses but these made me look like a pinhead.,0
3,Pretty. Chain a bit small in length,0
1,"Not very happy. Looks nothing like the item pictured. Looks more like a sick dog, the mouth looks horrible and the shape it really flimsy.  I read all the reviews they must have gotten a much better product. I'd keep looking as this is not a great mask.",0
5,llego correctamente,1
1,Muy trasparente si no tienesxun cuerpo bien formado lactela no hayuda a ormar el cuerpo,0
1,"The quality vs cost appears really good, the packaging was also very impressive. However It's so bulky for a woman's wrist, also very heavy and doesn't match my rosehold Apple Watch. The tools in the box are not easy to use to take out links and there were no instructions so I had to use a YouTube tutorial. Bottom line I am very disappointed and won't be able to use it because it's just too bulky for my wrist. I bought the 38mm (same size as the band that came with my watch), but it is just very masculine in size and style.",0
3,Kind of cheap quality but cute for one time use.,0
5,Received as a gift. They are nice earrings and look a bit nicer than pictured.,1
4,"Potential buyers should know that these are a tight fitting sock (and I only wear a 6.5 shoe). I thought I'd dislike them but the benefit of a tight sock is my shoes don't slip around when I wear these socks with them. I have some looser-fitting Amazon socks that are comfy around the house but too loose in shoes. So, I do like these tighter socks. :)  But it's obviously a preference. They're not thick but not flimsy-- medium weight.",1
2,"This thing is hideous. It is not wool. Tag on coat says cotton and polyester. Pleats are a silly looking as u can see. I normally wear med. 150 lbs 5.7"". This is a small and I would need to move buttons 2 inches over if I would of kept. Which I did not.  It is way to big.  Also shipping was 2 weeks out. Slllooow.",0
5,My HP fan son loved these socks!,1
1,Cardigan arrived with holes in the sleeve. Buyers beware,0
1,Much cheaper looking fabric than picture,0
4,"I was looking for a basic and comfortable dress to wear on a cruise. This dress fit the bill. I am 5'5' and the length is perfect. I love the pockets and the material is super comfy! I ordered it in Navy and it is not see-through. However, I could see that it would be if it was in a lighter color. It will be a great staple for my wardrobe.",1
1,"These shoes are so stiff. They dig into my heels and I have to wear them with special socks with padding on the heel. They are also incredibly difficult to get on. Unfortunately you have to see if a shoe breaks in nicely before you know how good it is, and at that point it is not returnable (well in this case a 50% restocking fee). So I just keep them to go on short walks bc even with the padded socks I get sores after a while.",0
3,Larger than size indicates.,0
2,"Junk, poor sewing,  Unhemmed in several places. Pants and shirt are short",0
1,Bottoms run small,0
1,Product would not fit my rayban wayfarers. The strap actually came apart as I was installing them on the glasses.,0
5,luv it,1
5,My son used the mask as part of his Grim Reaper Halloween costume and he was comfortable wearing it.  It allowed him to breath and see as he participated in eventa throughout the night,1
3,It might look stylish but decided to return it because the strap is not fully secured. It can easily be pulled out of your wrist.,0
3,"The product is a fairly soft blend that is ""cotton like"" to the touch... seems to be a nice weight to be appropriate for the summer months but is quite clingy.<br />I ordered the xxl ( i am 5'6"" and 200 lbs, normally a size 16 or 18. Unfortunately this didnt work very well with my 4 months postpartum body and was not the least flattering.<br />This dress just did not work for me personally but given the price, color selection, and prime shipping i would still recommend you trty this. Once again i wiah to reiterate that while the dress and fit did not work for me personally, i can see how this dress has decent reviews due to its versatility.",0
5,"Perfect!! Came quickly, were exactly as expected and THEY ARE ORANGE!!!! Yay!!!! So excited and I love them a lot!",1
3,"Didn't like the  shiny material, but overall it fit great",0
5,Gave as a Christmas gift. He loved it!! Words are clearly printed. Just as shown. Perfect!,1
1,"These are definitely Asian sizing.  It is tiny, tiny.  If you are anywhere between 14-20 in US sizing don't even bother ordering this.  Even the largest one will be too small.  Additionally, I tried to get a return and my request was completely ignored.  I'm going to have to find and Asian friend to give this to.  lol",0
4,Fits great but I didn't care for the buttons. I changed them and it looks great.,1
5,"Wish the top string was strechier it cut into skin sometimes and pinkie toe junction cuts in a little but beside that I love them, breathable, soft, fine stitching makes it durable and it's mostly stretchy.",1
1,This too fit ok but wasn’t the same good quality of the rose colored one I ordered.  The fitted part of the sleeve was a different material than the rest of the shirt.  It looks cheap.  Very disappointed,0
2,"When I received it, the2 parts are dismantled.  I had to put them together and make use of it.  This product is very poor quality.",0
5,"Love the fit, color,  material, everything",1
1,Freshly trimmed toenail and both socks had holes in the toes within an hour of putting them on. Thin material. Such a waste of money,0
5,This shirt fit very well and true to size.  The sleeves are a great length for a cool day.  It is a fun shirt for holiday get together when you want to feel festive.,1
5,"Good quality, color holds after washes. Slim fit. Just amazing.",1
5,Perfect beautiful I love it,1
5,I got this to replace my original strap and it is far superior!  The class are much easier to Clío on and off than my old one  The stitching is perfect.  Exceeded my expectations!,1
5,Size was as expected and material is really nice.<br />I recommend this blouse.,1
5,Awesome buy,1
2,Letters were falling off,0
5,"The dress is absolutely gorgeous. It flatters my curvy figure and conceals my little paunch by highlighting my waist. At 5'6&#34;, 178 pounds, I am not the typical medium, but miusol dresses in medium fits me perfectly thanks to their design. I have already bought 3 of their dresses without any regrets. The material is comfortable, thick and durable. Has a classy look to it and i can't wait to wear it. No shipping hassles - arrived quickly in 1-2 days in good packaging. Definitely recommend it as am 100% percent satisfied. Ladies - go for it!",1
2,"Hate the way these look on my feet, looks like I have hippo ankles. I should have returned them but I needed boots at the time.",0
1,This is not a good wrap. It only goes half way up👎🏽,0
3,"Like the casual style of this “runaround “ dress, however it runs small.  Not available in black in the next size so it went back.  Love the pockets",0
5,Cool shirt,1
5,"I bought it for my 13 years old son and he loves it. Great material, and fits him really well. He wears it with everything.",1
5,...love this! So comfortable and looks great.,1
1,"I went back and reviewed the photos and the description after I received my order.  I can't find anywhere that it says the plaid is gold, metallic threads...not white or cream as it appears.  I've requested a change in the description.  Pretty skirt but not what I wanted or expected.",0
3,I like the design but the bust and waist was a little tight,0
4,it would have been better if it was a little more thicker.,1
5,We have been on the hunt for warm socks and these are great!,1
5,Love this stays on my face better than a mask!,1
5,This is beautiful  one of my favorite  pieces,1
1,So very small it fits my 3 year old.  Amazon was amazing about the problems with the sizing.,0
4,Arrived quickly in a very nice gift box. It looked very nice and had a good quality chain. I gave it to a friend whose horse had recently died so she could put a lock of her horses hair in it. She loved it. Would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great necklace at a great price! So glad I found this one instead of paying $$$,1
5,One family was very impressed when they all received one @ our family reunion.  Fast delivery a cd good quality product.  Not chinsy at all.,1
3,"Girlfriend bought this and not happy with it. The problems is the sizes in different brands aren't the same, normally she's a 34B but thinking it would be too snug she bought a 36B instead, a bit big. She likes the way the straps feel, dont dig into her skin before or after a workout. The sheer on the cups she doesnt like since her nipples can show, she prefers a padded cup with coverage of them and of course the extra padded protection. Other than those things this bra isn't what she expected but she will wear it when it suits her.",0
5,I love that they come in multiple pairs!  I'm actually using them to 'dress-up' my homemade teddy bears....perfect for my use!,1
5,Expected comfort is what you get. Cold water wash low dryer or air dry,1
1,Both bracelets broke within a week. Totally not worth the money.  Super cheap and horribly made.,0
5,Great quality and when they got dirty I just threw them in the wash and they would come out looking like new.,1
3,The rings run kind of big so they aren’t really middie,0
5,"Very soft, form-fitting cardigan. I usually run a medium and this fits like a glove. So the sizing chart is accurate. If you want a little room or a baggy fit, size up a size. When worn open over a t-shirt, this lays very well on the body. Very high quality for the price. A lot of the reviews said this was thinner, which was what I was hoping for, but it's actually quite warm and thicker (to me). Most of my cardigans come from ModCloth and they are very thin, which I like. I wear cardigans as an accent piece more so than for warmth. That being said, I would not lower the star rating based on that expectation because this is a good quality cardigan and very flattering. I will just have to wait until it's a little cooler out before I wear it.",1
1,Thread was thin. Broke when I put it on.  So disappointed. Would not purchase again.,0
3,"The shirt shrunk ALOT after the first wash. Other then that, it is a very sure outfit",0
3,Good for what they are for. More of a pre teen size. A little big for kids a little small on bigger adult fingers.,0
5,Very durable,1
5,very pretty,1

1,Runs large and stretches way out very quickly ......I bought mine from lands end which I buy a lot of cloths from landsend but this knit although are comfy they run large even if they are snug when you put them on just wait and they will fall off you in a very short time so........I wear mine for pjs bc not up to my standards for wearing out anywhere bc of the stretching out of shape,0
3,Band continuously loosens<br />Face cover too large<br />Have to squeeze really hard to activate side button,0
1,"These are not the best leggings I have bought, but with that they are super thin and not what you think they will be",0
2,Looks like aluminum.,0
5,My wife like the fit on.plus she love show so much,1
3,"Very comfy and easy to wear. Pattern is very pixelated, but looks great across the room. Very stretchy material, which is comfy and easy to move.. Although, I can fit two of me in this dress.",0
4,"This worked great for my niece's birthday cake. I personally don't care for the look of the cupcake toppers, but my niece loved her cake.",1
1,Padded and uncomfortable,0
5,I love it so much and it brought my culture back to me for my graduation. Loved it,1
1,"This looks pretty in the pictures, but in person it is cheap and gaudy.  When I opened the box one of the (plastic) gemstones had already broken out of its casing.  Poorly made.  I returned it.",0
2,This does not stretch at all and the Waist has 0 Give.,0
5,Well worth the money,1
3,I totally love the ring. Will order from this company again.,0
1,Did not fit. I couldn’t get the sweater pass my shoulders. I had to return it unfortunately.,0

3,"This shoes very pretty. But is harts feet ,uncomfortable",0
1,Beutiful swimnwear but very small,0
5,Love mine. Great for th price. Bought to use at the Venetian in Vegas.,1
5,It's a scarf what else is there to say. Length is good color is true to picture we hand wash and hang to dry colors didn't bleed.,1
5,Love this shirt! 5 months PP and I feel like it hides the tummy and super cute 😍!,1
1,"These masks are massive and have zero shape to them.  My daughter looks a bit silly wearing them and they constantly slide off her nose. I tried one on myself and the face part was way bigger than my adult face, hanging floppily below my chin, though the ear loops wouldn’t reach my ears.  Such a weird shape.  I tried washing and drying them hoping they would shrink, but they didn’t budge.  I have to figure out a way to sew in a nose wire, and maybe sew the chin part? Idk, but I’m stuck with them now after washing them.  I would not recommend these.<br /><br />Update: So, I definitely wouldn’t send your child to school wearing these unless you want a phone call.  Thankfully, I noticed the gun on of one of the masks before sending my daughter to school in it.  I’m sure that would have resulted in a phone call, so we dodged a bullet (pun not intended).",0
1,This band scratches quickly if you work done waste your money. It looks trashed quickly.,0
1,Another shirt bought on Amazon that is too small. Simple put dont buy shirts on Amazon. I bought this one size bigger because of all the crap and behold too small. Bought another shirt the same exact size dimensions and behold too big.,0
4,"Very pretty and looks like the picture.  I'm very pleased with it, nice silky feel.  I gave it only 5 stars, because I bought it as a gift intended for a swimsuit cover up and have not seen how the material holds up when wet and dried.",1
3,Look nice.,0
3,"These socks are very comfortable...however they don't seem to stay up.  I don't know if it's my wiggly feet or a problem with the product itself.  Once I almost slipped because the extra fabric left at the toe doubled up on me.  If you buy them, just be sure to pull them up anytime you stand up when wearing them.",0
2,Didn't last long in the salt water. Lens scratch very easily and purple color comes off fast,0
2,Needs a new battery:(,0
2,Unfortunately this shirt is too short. I have never liked shirts that are not long enough. It will not get worn..,0
1,"Pretty but way, way too big.  Seller should list the inner dimension, not the overall length of it.",0
3,"It’s ok, but it’s definitely not what I ordered. I ordered the gray shirt with white buttons but got a blue shirt with brown buttons. Would love to not deal with the hassle of returning it but still have the correct shirt sent to me.",0
5,Dope wallet. After losing my last power rangers wallet I needed to get a replacement. And this one does the trick. It holds my money with no problems. I'm the coolest kid on the block with this wallet,1
1,bought these for my boyfriend. Sad to say that one pair ripped at the front on his first day wearing them. Very displeased. Wouldn't recommend. Update: another pair has ripped like the first one did. Where's my refund?,0
5,"I bought this bag for my husband birthday present and let me tell you this is a very sharp bag !!!! The leather looks and feels expensive !! this bag is also very roomy but just the right travel size . My husband has gotten complements on his travel and at work  when he use his travel bag.I think it was an awesome investment because my hubby does not like anything that is cheap or looks cheap, and he lets that be known by the look on his face when he gets a present. LOL!!However he has been using it for 3 months now every single day and it still looks new and I think it will last him a very long time.!!!!",1
1,"The quality of the material is good BUT they loosely hang off your ears, nothing keeps them on. They slightest movement and they fall right off. I don't see how anyone gets any use from these. Returning asap for a different option.",0
2,did not like fabric,0
3,My only complaint is that the bow piece broke off of the chain. Make sure that you tighten the loop connecting the bow and the bar.,0
5,Love them! Wear everyday!,1
5,I love this top so much. I’m going back to get another color.,1
2,"These don't look anything like the picture in the ad. Very disappointing...Not what I was expecting, and not what I wanted.",0
4,I liked everything about this sweater top… it is absolutely gorgeous. This is my second time purchasing this type but different color. Will be buy more.. the sizing is very accurate and that’s what I love about this brand. Screenshot rules!!!!,1
5,I love these pants! They stay up but aren't crazy tight or anything. Very comfortable. Love the colors.,1
3,Stuck well to the bread but not my face,0
5,"Very nice watch.  Plus, excellent customer service. Thanks.",1
1,It literally twisted upwards on me with every step,0
5,Every thing was perfect,1
5,"So simple and cute, exactly the right size... exactly what I was looking for!",1
2,"I got this band to use with my Samsung gear S3 Frontier smart watch.  22mm fits exactly right.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite clasp designs out there.  It's very secure and can be done/undone with one hand.  I've had several watches that use it and I've always liked it.  However, this clasp mechanism is not the best.  It clasps but only with some work.  The more narrow securing clasp also takes a lot of work get latched.  So you have to work too much at getting it latched, IMHO, and it's frustrating.<br /><br />Also keep in mind that you have to get the spring bars separately.  Don't get the quick release kind that have a nob on the side, you have to get the standard ones that are completely straight.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The &#34;links&#34; are not individual chain links.  They are steal wire that are looped within each other.  When I went to cut a couple of the rows off of each side to make it fit I saw that the whole thing was coming undone.  So ... you can not cut rows of the chain off without ruining the entire watch band.<br /><br />In summary:  Bad quality clasp and it can not be resized.",0
2,Do not buy if you have a small face. They will just fall off if you bend over. Not a good fit at all. My face is not big but it isn’t super skinny either.,0
1,Wore one time and my finger poked a hole<br />Would not recommend,0
4,Love the quality of the shirt and the graphics. The one down side is the use solid reflective striping that doesn’t have a lot of give to it. And it is 360 deg. around your torso then add in the shoulder stripes and your actual size shirt feels a little constrictive.,1
5,So happy with this purchase!! I love the hidden finger holes would like to order another color!,1
3,It's OK! I must have small wrist or this is mad for men but its BIG on me.,0
5,Bought some of these and some from the competitors I think they were cheaper. they were together for a reason most of the little dots are falling off of the other ones whereas these are still very much intact.,1
1,Missing one item and I paid for 9 pieces,0
3,"its just okay.  Little disappointed because it was very hard to fasten the clasp on the earrings.  also, I found that these earring were very uncomfortable to wear.  Looks like the ones I ordered were defective.",0
3,"Cute, but runs small. I am a Med/LG and ordered an Extra Large and it's still tight.",0
4,This was just for the one lightweight navy cardigan with flowers that are pictured. It's very pretty but keep in mind that it's very lightweight so wash it carefully.,1
4,I’m a slim petite US 5/6 and the pants fit perfectly even though it’s labeled as XXL. The quality is good and very warm soft thick fabric. Only issue is sizing. Runs very small.,1
1,Broke the first time I wore it!,0
1,Returned. Too small and didn’t fit right,0
2,Add is very misleading. Thought I was going to be getting 5 different colored wrist bands and only recieved one. Very disappointed,0
3,I loved these boots but once again the calf did not fit. I am not a large person by any means but something about this brand the calf runs small. So sad.,0
2,Loved the look but they were way too heavy,0
1,"Very cute and arrived way before estimated delivery date, but within the first hour I had it on the chain broke and the cute little heart charm was gone, I always wear anklets in the summer with my sandals and have never had one break this quickly.  So disappointed because it really was cute",0
5,Muy linda queda perfecta,1
5,I am very pleased I finally found a beanie that actually stays on all night.,1
5,Love this my husband is a forestry Ranger,1
4,"I ordered an xxl as I wasn’t sure what I could wear as I’m normally a xl but sometimes need bigger due to meds I’m on. But knew if it was to big for me it would fit my husband. (I’m 5 ft 3in and from 190 to 240 lbs) it swallowed me sleeves to long, etc although I could put it on as an emergency case. But my 5 ft 9 in 315 lb husband it fits perfect, and actually isn’t tight or big “just right”.... the texture wasn’t super soft but wasn’t itchy or anything either. If I hadn’t bought another type for me I would by this in a smaller size for me.",1
3,Fit and fabric all fine but had to return it because it had a small hole in the front (not on the seam) that could not be repaired.,0
3,"Cute.  Order up.  The gold letters are hard to read on the white shirt, but cute enough for the holidays",0
5,"These have really helped me when I am driving at night.  Headlights from oncoming traffic was blinding me, so much so that I thought I might not be able to drive at night much anymore.  As a last resort, I tried these and they make all the difference.  They have been so helpful.  While I was out of town last fall, my sister was using my car when she realized that she had forgotten her sunglasses.  She found these in my console, tried them and liked them so much that I ordered a pair for her.",1
5,i love it - great quality,1
3,"I really like this necklace but after two times wearing it, the center metal design piece fell off.  Discovered it was only set with a thin layer of glue. Since I like this necklace, I will try gluing it back and cross my fingers the piece stays  for a while  longer.",0
1,The watch cracked withon a week or so and than stopped working altogether from the contact with water. This was supposed to be a good quality water resist Casio watch - but turns out it is REALLY bad!!,0
1,I liked the style of it but very thin didnt fit well zippers are weak...,0
3,Made big for sure if u want a tight fit don't recommend getting the actual size u wear it will be way to big,0
2,Broke within a day of me wearing it,0
2,Material was cheap.,0
1,Went right in the trash.,0
3,These are a stretchy wristband for my car keys. They serve the function but I was hoping they would be a little less rigid/stiff and more stretchy.,0
5,Needed a mask. Not a lot to say. It works for me.,1
5,Fits as expected! Very soft. I received a lot of compliments on this sweater.,1
5,"My son is 4 and this fits him perfectly. He’s about 3 1/2 feet tall and about 35 pounds. He loves it and has been wearing it for about a week now and it’s help up nicely, even when he does his Spider-Man moves.",1
2,The piece was a gift... The top doesn't stay connected to the bottom!!! Pin comes out....,0
5,Very nice robe,1
3,Oddly made. Bigger bottom than top.,0
4,Love the product!!! But the wrong size was sent.,1
1,Horrible! Do not buy,0
5,Great quality and love the look of this mask,1
5,"Love this item, it fits true to size and I would recommend this product.  I would also order again.",1
1,For what I paid I’d expect better quality<br />Very thin and itchy<br />Daughter won’t wear,0
3,This top is ok. In the first picture it does look like it is made like a sweater however in the other pictures it is a lightweight fabric which this certainly is. Also does not have the bell sleeves. Looks cuter in the pics online but will do for what I wanted it for.,0
3,I wear size M which is technically 8-10. This t-shirt is closer to 8 rather than 10. It's really snug and shows all the imperfections I have in tummy area. I do not like that. It's well made and is genuinely a nice t-shit but it feels very confining and constricting when I put it on.,0
1,They were very small. Will not fit someone who has lower leg swelling. Did not have much stretch at all. Very disappointed,0
3,"Bought the 12/14 size. My daughter is 5ft 92lbs. The pants fit great, the top not so much. The top is very large.  Material is silky, little cheap feeling but seems ok.",0
4,"I ordered these for my husband and used the sizing chart pictured. Do not go by that chart-order your regular size! Other than sizing being off they were as expected. Good quality, fast shipping. My son inherited them as he’s a larger size and he likes them.",1
5,"It definitely keeps its promise of having a slimming effect, in that there is no buckle bulge showing.  It's easy to wear, easy to fasten and unfasten, and the elastic gives it a good fit which helps keep the pants up!  And of course, being continuously adjustable is a great feature.  I've been wearing it often since I got it, because I like to wear shirts out, in all weather.  It is especially good for under sweaters.",1
5,Very comfortable,1
2,General product.,0
2,Larger than the average 3-6 months size. Will not be able to wear for holiday,0
5,Beautiful and worth money.  Is for a small wrist so be careful if larger wrist.  Even a teenager would like,1
5,"I am 5'1, so the dress comes to my knees. It is not a short dress like in the picture. The material is very comfortable and flexible. The belt is awesome because it covers my pouch. The price is excellent for the quality.",1
5,The necklace is very beautiful and the size is perfect.,1
5,"Very nice and plenty of room for all sorts of documentation and assorted cards and IDs. This is a handy little baby to have if you travel a lot.<br /><br />The seller, in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, supplied me with this product or gave it at a discount.<br /><br />What you have read is solely my very honest opinion based on my expertise and experience with this product.",1
1,Dress too small.  Also sequins scrapped my arms when trying it on. Very uncomfortable and itchy.,0
2,This is both poorly made and unflattering for my pear figure.,0
1,The summary of this item is horrible.<br />In face it turns your finger green by day 2<br />Doesn't keep its shape and was simply a disappointing purchase,0
5,"The texture of these yoga pants is very soft, it is very thin, quick-drying, and very convenient. It feels unburdened to wear such trousers when starting to run, and it is very light. And there is also a hidden pocket for easy storage of mobile phones. Ideal for fitness enthusiasts and daily sports activities.",1
3,Cute dress but the pleats on the bust made the top too tight and caused the pleats to open and look unsightly on me.,0
5,Classy little balls,1
5,At last I have a long rain coat that keeps me dry in pouring rain.Very strong& easy to store.,1
5,nice pajamas. detachable feet are great,1
4,I needed something that would buckle wherever I needed it to buckle and without specific holes in the belt make that easy.  It is obviously not as stiff as a regular belt would be but it seems to work fine for what I am looking for.  It seems like it stretches a little which isn't a problem so I am satisfied with it.,1
3,jewels fell out soon after purchase,0
1,Used as a dust collector thus far,0
3,Nice shirt but made too short. I can't wear it. Shows my bellybutton 🤷‍♀️,0
5,Nice watch and the glass is extremely durable.,1
1,"This would be my third purchase of these pants, first time they fit great and I still love them, second time they were probably 3-4 sizes too small figured that was just an accident so I ordered them again, made sure to check the tag and it said 2x so I thought I was good until I tried them on and they were a little too tight and way too short. Will be sending these back, and I would definitely not recommend that you purchase from this seller/company.",0
1,This is a very Cheap Quality product and the Suction cups that are proved don't stick to the Mirror.,0
5,"I really love this tank top. It's comfy and loose fitting. Ironically, not super great for yoga because it'll fall into your face while you're upside down but I wear it to run sometimes and just around the house or playing outside with the kids. My bra doesn't show through which I was a little nervous about because the material is pretty thin. Perhaps if I had a lighter color it would have been more of an issue but mine is navy. I would definitely buy this again.",1
5,My niece loved it,1
5,Exactly what I ordered husband loved it,1
4,"I have tried so many, and these are light, yet effective, and do energize the legs.  It easy on if you use a sock butler,  its fantastic little plastic frame that helps you put compression socks on.  Just wished they came in different colors.",1
5,"They fit great. I got them for compression for a burn injury. I am 5"" 9"" and 175 lbs with a gut. Medium fit well.",1
5,Flaterring and festive! This dress was a hit at the office Christmas party.,1
5,"This product work excellent as I was intended, I'm very satisfied with it.",1
5,Fast shipping. Item as described. My daughter loves it!,1
3,"The vent in the side has a round plastic disk, doesn't protect you from germs",0
1,This product was very disappointing.  It is not true to size. Very small,0
3,"My husband is ruff on belts and these weren't any different. They work quite well, but the durability wasn't the best. I personally think it has to do with how tight he wore it, but it did keep his shirt tucked in.",0
1,Don't be fooled this is not a true Nike wallet.i was due for a replacement for my current real Nike wallet that lasted several years this made with faux leather stitching broke within 2 weeks,0
2,Disappointed in the colors on this hat-the picture shows a lighter charcoal hat with black lettering.  The actual hat is almost black and you can hardly read Jeep on it.,0
1,nunca llego nada....pesimooo,0
1,"I ordered  an E & a J, but was sent two Es😑😑😑 I like the style & quality of it, just wish I'd gotten my J! M Blackshear Gallon",0
1,"I ordered 2 packs. I opened both packs and hand washed some of them before using.with the intent of giving a couple of them to family.  After I carefully hand washed them, the stitches on the red was coming off and the valves fell off. These are poorly made and I want my money back.  Please give me shipping label to send them back.  They are not worth your money.<br />Quality is not even a 1 but that is the lowest rating shown.  Quality is 0.",0
5,And I always get a ton of compliments! Glasses arrived well before my vacation-thanks!,1
1,If I could give this product no stars I would the picture is very deceiving my suit came in the mail missing a strap,0
3,"It's a pretty watch, but the links are not as easy to remove as made to believe. The device for removing links that came with it broke before I was done using it so I had to improvise to finish fixing the watch for my wife.",0
4,Worked really well! Previous reviews forewarned me so the XL was perfect!,1
5,I love these earrings. I bought these to replace the pair to replace the same ones I lost. They are the perfect size and you can wear then to dress up or down. Awesome earrings and good quality. Delivered on time as well!!,1
3,Fit well. I’m 5’3” 180lbs I purchased a large. I had to return it because the sequence was catching onto everything. I was afraid of damaging dress so I chose to return it.,0
3,Very comfortable shirt for everyday users,0
5,"Talle perfecto, hermoso escote, talle perfecto, largo correcto muy lindo color y estampado",1
3,"I got the multicolor coffee with the brown and blue print skirt.  The print is cute but the top is black not coffee (not obvious from the photo).  First, why would we want yet another black top?  (And I live in New York.. We wear a lot of black.)  Secondly, it was the brown blue combination that made it cute and different.  I bought a size medium and am returning it for a large, in another color combination.",0
5,"I don’t like a lot of things happening on the face of my watches. This GS is the perfect watch for simply telling me the time with a touch of a tactical look. Gave it 4 stars due to a kinda thin band. I’m used to my GS having a thicker band. But it’s not like a girls watch !! App is good but I do wear a Garmin at work, I’m a firefighter and need the GPS often. Off duty I wear the GS. If you want a solid Black Face with white hands this is for you.",1
2,Cheap fabric and shipping took forever!!!,0
3,The overall design is cute. But the bloomers are huge. The top seems to fit loosely but it fits. The material is extremely soft and appears to be durable. I just wish the fit was a little tighter.,0
1,Shirt and pants do NOT match.,0
1,"Bought from Joe's USA<br /><br />1. It is not branded as Joe's like described, it is Koloa and a Port Authority Hoodie<br />2. It is not 50/50 blend. It is 78% cotton and 22% polyester<br />3. The tye dye job isn't that great<br />4. The hoodie feels HORRIBLE<br /><br />I can get better things at a box store for cheaper when they are in season. For a little more, I can get a water resistant name brand, but my inner toddler was attracted by all the COLORS! Don't let your inner toddler win. DO NOT GET THIS. You will not get what you order.<br /><br />(And I doubt it 7.8-8 ounce since it's not made out of what it is supposed to be)",0
4,"I read to size up in the reviews.. I am a small and tried the large. It cute for a tight crop top fit but not for everyday. I just ordered another one in x large and should fit perfect. I'm 5,'3, 120 pounds.",1
5,"I love this bracelet, it is very contemporary  and can be dressed up or down.",1
5,"These are my favorite socks for my 2 year old! They wash really well, and are pretty well made! I will be ordering more since we always always misplace socks in this house! Lol!",1
1,Fell apart from the ring within a week of purchase,0
1,"The first time wearing the armor,  the shoulder strap started to tare from the shoulder material.  Now keep in mind I haven't even fallen while wearing, just out riding dirt roads.  Very weak material that is attached to the plastic pieces on the shoulder.  I'm not much into returns so I'll eat the loss.  I just ordered the Alpinestars armor.",0
5,I had been looking for a small light weight watch that would be easy to see in low light while sitting in my tree stand. The Lorus Lumibrite Military Watch is perfect for these conditions. It’s been a year since I purchased it and it still glows in the dark like the day I bought it and has not lost a minute of time.<br />If your a deer hunter want to be able to see when legal hunting time is over then this is the watch for you. It is a great watch at a great price.<br />Thank you Lorus!,1
5,"Super cute addition to dress anything simple up a tad! Love it, get tons of compliments on it every time I wear it!",1
1,The quality was not as expected. The letters were not white at all! more like a odd pink.,0
4,Bought for mother in law. She likes them.,1
4,"For five dollars, could not ask for more. That said, the fabric is a bit scratchy but nothing I'd fret about. I tailored each shirt to fit (so easy, check out you tube). I hope the kids didn't suffer too much sewing these (joking/not joking). Did I mention they are cheap???",1
5,"Great, soft fabric, not see through nor thick. Perfect for any season",1
1,This dress is made for someone with a small chest & a petite body. Not happy with the purchase.,0
2,"Fabric is cheap, although it feels comfortable but I doubt it's breathable. Shorter than photo.",0
4,The hat is really cute and the brim is very wide. It is well made. The fabric is not thin or very breathable but it feels soft.,1
1,These were not a good purchase. The toggle fell off as soon as you pulled it.,0
1,I ordered two of these. One came and the jewel in the middle had already fallen out. After one wear the other lost one of its “eyes.” I guess this is why they were so cheap to purchase — but even a few $ is too much to pay for junk!,0
5,Worth the price,1
1,TOO HARD TO GET THEM UP!!!,0
2,"Delivery was on time. The jacket is warm, lining is good, fur on hood is good, length is good, but it is very heavy and tight in the middle of the jacket. Also the arm pits or where the arms are attached into the body of the jacket are very tight (this is without a sweater, just a T-shirt on)<br />I am a women who is trying to buy a jacket but all the women's jackets are very small. I wear a medium and I am ordering large in women's and they do not fit. My friend said order a men's jacket which I wii be doing this coat  is not true to size.",0
1,"Beautiful watch, but didn't work.",0
1,"I'd never buy these again. The first day they ripped on the side from just bending, they are the same as all the other shorts I have no issue with. Trash.",0
4,A very nice dress,1
1,"These socks while obviously will built, should say VERY FIRM.  I had a hard time just getting these socks on my sock assist, once on, it was impossible to get my foot, much less my entire leg up to the calf, into these compression socks.<br /><br />I have worn Dr. Scholl's Diabetic compression socks for the past 5 years.  They wear well and I need to replace them about once a year.  I think these socks, not this make, but the cotton socks that are over the calf are truly life savers.  So I'm not knocking the product just this socks compression ratio.",0
2,"They are cute, however two of them arrived with no keychain attached. Disappointed as I was using for birthday party goody bags.",0
5,It wasn’t thick and warm enough and expected the oposité,1
1,"I use this product to carry items to and from work.  After three weeks the stitching came off the strap that attaches to the hasp, reattached it with fishing wire.  Then a week later the d-ring sewing, which attaches to the hasp, failed.  I would not recommend this product.  Does not seems to be made with quality products.",0
1,"It's a giant bag. Very heavy material, very long, horrible lines, not flattering.",0
4,I like the suit and it fits as expected. The color is exactly as I had hoped. I like the 'retro' look of it and it has support.,1
2,I am 5’5” and 140 lbs. and the medium was quite large on me. It looked like I was wearing a potato sack. The material is very thin and cheap. The seams were already busting/opening. I don’t recommend. It doesn’t look ANYTHING like the dress on the model.,0
2,"Ordered size 11 and recieved a EURO 29. The insole measures 6.5 inches. The color of the shoe appears gold just as the bow. What I received was a matte gold, almost brown shoe and the bow is shiny gold as pictured. Sadly I will be returning the sister set I purchased.",0
2,It was cheap and not a sweatshirt at all. Felt like stretchy costume material.,0
4,Perfect👌,1
5,"This is a beautiful pendant by Crystal Art Project Store. The 18in, rhodium finished, gold-toned, silver chain holds a stunning 39mm (2in) Galactic (pale brown/amber) pendant. It is not perfectly shaped, so looks and feels very authentic and natural. It is a nice size, which stands out well against certain fabrics and colors. It definitely catches the light and the eye, which makes it a beautiful gift for yourself or someone else.",1
1,"The glasses glasses are sunglasses with a film over the lenses which show little hearts from light sources.  Its not great but they look kind of cool if you can get the light sources just right.  However, this was supposed to be christmas stocking stuffers and we only tested one and it turned out 2 of the 4 were faulty because they didn't even have the heart film on them.  Hoo-ray.<br /><br />Contacted seller and asked for two that worked and all they responded was a straight up, I can refund 6 dollars.  I responded no I would like the two replacements please because you can't buy 2 with 6 dollars.  This was for my family on Christmas and would like two more that worked please.<br /><br />Yeah, they refunded $6.50.  No further response, no nothing.  It was the biggest ""just shut up and take the money go go, shoo shoo"" that I've had on Amazon.<br /><br />I want to be sure that everybody knows what they're getting into when buying from this seller.  As for us?  I just want to never think of this again, but I'm sure as heck not going to keep quiet about it on their reviews page. :)<br /><br />Good luck, hope you get 4 working sunglasses everybody.  They really only work best on strong sources of light or maybe night time.  But don't be that guy who wears their sunglasses at night. 😎",0
2,Side seam came a part after 2 washings.,0
4,"Nice suit.  Purchased for my daughter.  Covered well,  but still cute.  The hem in the top came loose after a few weeks,  but repaired easily.  This was my daughter's favorite this past summer.",1
3,Really thin fabric but fast shipping,0
5,I bought two similar ones when i was in Ireland and wanted to get another for a friend as a brithday gift. I was thrilled tofind it on Amazon - it arrived timely and was beautiful  Cannot wait for my firend to oen it on her birthday.,1
2,Sooooooooooo much smaller than I thought.,0
3,"I love the color and structure. It has a sheen to it, very feminine. The size XL was too tight across the chest. I'm 5'4"" and wear a large top. The sleeves were a tad short, too. Therefore, I had to return it.",0
4,"Not enough room in the seat, but other than said he said it works.",1
4,Nice,1
4,"these fit great and stretched my ears as intended, i would suggest looking for a (1ga taper) because going from the 2ga to the 0ga taper (included in the kit) was so brutal and ive suffered minor ear ripping because of it but i suppose i should have stayed at 2's longer then 3 weeks before jumping like that, but long story short they are (now) fine and not hurting and i intend to most likely go to the 00 included in the kit in the next month or two so i can get some awesome tunnels, look up pinwheel flesh tunnels they are so sick!<br />thank you :)",1
3,As a 6ft tall woman I was expecting these to be higher then they are. They only go up mid calf but are very warm and sturdy. I won't be buying another pair as I was looking for a taller sock.,0
3,"I LOVE these pants, I have ordered 3 pairs and none fit correctly, I keep trying though.  Last pair had the pocket sewed shut, first pair had no butt, was impossible to pull them up all the way.",0
3,I wear a size 8 1/2 and I order a 9 cause I read the reviews and seen that these run small and they still were a tad to small so a size 10 would have worked if I had the time to send back ..Also if you are worried because you have larger calves they did fit around my calves and mine are big but my foot slid forward when walking around the house in them so I knew these wouldn't work for me but they are just as pretty in person to bad I didn't wear them out!,0
3,Not as long as I expected runs small,0
5,She'll loves it.  Gonna need a thicker chain.,1
2,Fit it fine mainly don't like the color it's way off from the picture,0
5,LOVE THE COLOR OF THIS PRODUCT BUT IT'S EASY TO GET DIRTY CONSIDERING THE WHITE.  BUT I LOVE IT AND HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT..  THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT,1
1,The ‘tunic’ was so short that it hit just below my waist.  Very dissatisfied with the product. The neckline was good but the rest of the shirt appeared to be cut way too short.,0
5,"They kinda looked funny at first but they are the most comfortable sandals I’ve ever had their beautiful love them, True to size the color is amazing",1
5,"Very comfortable dress. I ordered xl and I weight 185, great fit. Love the pockets, will be ordering another color.",1
5,It’s ok 4 just my wallet,1
3,"The design of the scarf and pattern is really nice. It had a medium sized thickness and great length. The only downside was the scarf fabric was a bit rough on the skin. Unfortunately, I returned the scarf since my dad didn’t enjoy the feel of the fabric.",0
5,I love the red,1
5,"Awesome my girlfrienoved it , dilivered fast too<br />. thanks so much<br />...",1
3,"I love the print and the dress fit my daughter perfectly, however my dress came about 3” too short (and I only stand 5’2”). The dress is what I call a “flood” dress. I actually hemmed it to a short tunic, but disappointed with the initial length.",0
1,These socks are really annoying because they keep coming off as you walk. They refuse to stay on your heel.,0
3,"Hat quality is great, but the front of the hat is awkward and somewhat ""poofy"". It leaves oddly placed air gaps in the hat that almost makes your head look lumpy while wearing.",0
3,"The fit and look is great but the glasses smell &#34;skunky&#34;, wondering if anyone else is getting this odor?",0
4,a gift for a loved one.  he really liked it.,1
3,"Onesie is so cute and looked great on my one year old. My only complaint is the picture shows Elmo on the jeans.  However I did not receive jeans with ELMO on them.  For those considering purchasing this product, the jeans are from Children's Place and the onesie is from Carter's. This will help you with sizing as my son wears 18 months in jeans from Children's Place but I purchased 12 months for both. All and all happy with the product but probably would have purchased the onesie only.",0
5,Loved these belts. They look great to liven up a plain dress and I receive compliments on them every time I wear them.,1
5,Perfect for protecting my hands while out in the sun,1
5,Product came as described and even came quicker than expected time ! We were in dire need of these as my daughter works as cashier at market basket !,1
5,"Got this as a Christmas present for my daughter who is going to grad school at USC in South Carolina.  She is also a member of the sorority, Sigma Sigma Sigma, which has pearls and anchors as part of their insignia.  This t-shirt combined the best of both worlds for her.",1
4,"Trachten makes a beautiful Dirndl that I would be happy to wear amongst my German friends. The embroidery is well done and the seams are sturdy, as is the material. It comes in three pieces that fit well together, and the outfit is comfortable to wear. I have not tried to dry clean it yet.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was a little better is the zipper - it does not come completely to the top in front, and there is a rubber flower hanging off of it, which detracts slightly from the overall quality feel of the dirndl. I suppose I could cut it off, but then I feel as if there would be more attention drawn to the black zipper in the middle of the closure at the bust.<br /><br />I would suggest if possible that you do follow the measurement guide and use that to decide on size, as the fit of the pieces together makes a difference in how it looks. I ordered a little bigger than I usually wear (as suggested by another reviewer), and it does look a bit larger in front due to this.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with the purchase.",1
4,Love it,1
2,way too small and it doesn't come in any other sizes anywhere else on the internet either',0
4,"There's not a heck of a lot to say about this; it's a glasses case with MOLL-E attachments.  That part is fairly obvious, and you can make your own logical inferences about how you might use it.  The one aspect that wasn't immediately apparent to me was the 'shockproof' aspect -- it's a semi-hard case; that's all that I was expecting in terms of shock-proofing.<br /><br />Actually, it has a flexible panel, inside, that anything (i.e., glasses) you put inside is resting on, and more or less cocooned by, once it's zipped closed -- it does a surprisingly good job of cushioning things.  In my case, I have a cheap plastic eyeglass case for the glasses I stick in it, but it's still got enough space to hold the entire case AND zip closed, while providing some nice security.  Since I have it hooked to a 'go' bag, I appreciate it being sturdy enough to not worry about bumping it into things, and the shock-proofing helps keep from having my lenses pop out or anything like that.  (It's not a hard-shell, so if you put your glasses directly into it you should realize how much protection you have and don't have -- me sticking another case into it, tho, leaves it pretty solid, for me.)<br /><br />As to the MOLL-E connections.. Well, I have it on a bag with MOLL-E connections, so I've got it connected several ways -- the strap AND the clip.  Is it necessary?  I'm certain it's not; I just like the extra security of the redundancy.",1
3,Nice color,0
5,Perfect. Beautiful color!,1
1,"THIS WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID, YUK.",0
5,I love this top! I'm a medium to large but got large so if it did shrink in the wash it would still be comfortable to wear. This has been nice a cool for the warm summer days. I like that I can wear this casually or semi-formal wear. I recommend washing this cold and hang drying it.,1
5,I have more compliments on this necklace than anything else I own! Very beautiful!,1
1,Did not fit!,0
5,One of the best.<br />Good quality.,1
4,My nephew loved it,1
1,Damaged wasn’t able to return,0
5,"High quality hoodie with vibrant colors, quality zipper, breatheable materials.  My favorite hoodie already.",1
3,these glasses are very comfortable for me,0
1,These gloves do not stay on my 20 month old.,0
4,"I love these for wearing when hiking or cycling, but they would be perfect if they had a nose wire to keep glasses from fogging up, and to prevent spread of virus.",1
5,"Bought for very occasional use during an Alaska cruise, as down here in South Texas I had NO rain gear except big old golf umbrellas.  I've used it since then as well a few times and it is very well made and durable.  Quite large, easily fit my 6'2"" frame.  Snapped up sides so stay dry in wind as well.  Very good purchase.  Originally was going to discards it after the cruise, but high enough quality that I've kept it for reuse.",1
5,my son wanted those came fast he is happy,1
1,Does not stay on face.,0
5,This works great with my 8 year old with special needs.,1
1,"the quality is good but its too small , i should  order the medium size",0
1,Very poor quality one time use only. shrink and color fade after 1st wash,0
1,See through,0
2,"I was surprised by how cheap the fabric and design look in person, but I love how the dress flares at the bottom and it is very comfortable, even with a petty coat.",0
2,[[VIDEOID:bfe768ca37da24dc745b7a8a56d901d]] Shirt is more fitting so you cant tie it the way its portrayed in the picture. The shirt is also lighter than pictured. I just had ahoulder surgery so it was atill easy to put on but lavks the cuteness factor,0
2,Very cute but the butterfly literally fell off when I removed it from the package.,0
1,"I believe I got the wrong size but I don’t like the fabric it’s like bed sheets it’s really thin and feels like a curtain and if you wash it too much it might fray at the seems, it feels real cheaply made to me, I got an lx but I probably could use a large inside but even then it’s the way it feels",0
5,I love this dress. It can easily be transformed into a maternity dress. It looks great with gray leggings. I get so many complements. It keeps you nice and cool.,1
5,Does a great job,1
1,"It didn’t work, right from delivery. Bought a new battery, still no luck",0
5,Medium was perfect fit.,1
5,So cute. Fits very well and very comfortable!!! Highly recommend!,1
1,The picture looks much better than the actual product. Unfortunately the actual product only has a spriggle of the green and the resin is murky. I reached out to the seller and they expected me to pay for shipping to return it to receive a refund! Bogus!,0
3,"4’11” - 120 lb. - Love the boots, perfect heel height.  Purchased 6.5 as always.  Wearing around house & find my heel slips in these boots (w/socks)  Too wide in heel,  but  rounded toe allows foot room.  Imagine they will stretch as they are leather.  Plan to try a size 6, other than that I will just give these boots an okay as far was fit goes.  Great style!  Would suggest more arch support.",0
5,Love this dress! I wore it to a Star Wars themed wedding. I got lots of compliments. Very flattering as well!,1
5,I purchased this dress for my mother who is very petite and thin. She looked absolutely amazing. Beautiful dress and good quality for the money.,1
3,This shirt runs small. I'm 5’4 about 235 I got a XL AND RETURNED IT. DEBATING if i’ll purchase it again.,0
5,This tie looks amazing on with a suit. I got it for a get together. I love the quality of the fabric. It also was really easy to clean. I was worried that the washer might ruin it but it was fine. I just made sure to hang dry it.,1
1,Love the leggings but I put them on and right away noticed these gross spots on them! Very distrusting and even had hair on them. It’s like they were returned and shipped again without being checked. I am very disappointed and grossed out.,0
3,"i bought two of these - nice shirts, but one arrived in bad shape: not folded properly causing the collar to be sticking out in various directions, and missing two buttons.  i took a chance and ordered a replacement but i'm not happy having to waste my time with a return because the folks who packed this could care less about the buyer.",0
2,This suit is true to size. I really like the style and color. But it arrived dirty on the top. Flaw is you can see the cups through the front fabric. Cups also are too much of a cone madonna bra style. So I have to return.,0
1,Not the color pictured.,0
5,"Love these leggings, super comfy and cute!",1
2,"Junk. The post was glued on askew.<br />Larger than they appear, FYI",0
1,Instead of this super cute wedge they send you knock off copper colored birkenstocks.,0
5,A+ Looks great! Great quality!,1
1,Very cheap and smelled of chemicals,0
1,These ran small and way too short!!!,0
1,"This bag looks nice, but the strap and buckles totally fell off after about 5 weeks. Very poor construction.",0
5,"Great sunglasses at a great price. They fit well, and come with a case and glass cloth. Well worth it!",1
3,The clasps,0
1,Too small,0
1,would have been adorable if it didn't come in with a rip on the seam of the neck.  I walked around like a limp flamingo all night..got a few laughs..,0
3,I went by the size chart and it fit small.  Also I had a hard time getting the collar to sit right without showing the seam near the neckline.  It would not be so bad except the seam looks like the inside seam because of the construction.,0
5,Exactly what I expected & I love it! Thank you(:,1
5,"These earrings are really pretty, given as a gift and glad I purchased.",1
1,"Skirt is too stiff, too thick, too hot.The skirt portion feels like thick flannel material that has been starched and ironed.",0
5,I love the shape and that it oversized!,1
1,"Garbage, absolute garbage, not even 3 weeks later the buckle broke.",0
4,I have been purchasing Troika key chains for some time now and am very happy with their products. The D Click is very good quality product. I love the design. I just wish it had two more key rings.,1
4,"Purchased 2 hats from this company, one blue, one plaid.  Good quality, flex fit has the right size band.  One came with wrong size and they shipped a new one right away and didn't even require me to send back the wrong sized one.",1
5,Excellent fit. I went two sizes up. I love the suit. I am a 38 DDD and this suit fits me perfect. It came right on time and was neatly packaged.  Very satisfied.,1
5,Pricey but Great,1
3,"I want to see warranty card, but I can not find it.",0
4,"Fits great and feels good on, very soft",1
2,"I was really hopeful with this trainer . It was thick, comfy and gave good stretch. However the piping in the back that gives support gas already broken through the fabric and I haven't even had it 2 weeks.  I didn't even contact the seller because I didn't want to deal with the hassle.",0
5,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 162 lbs, 36C and ordered a medium. It fit perfectly. I was able to wear a normal bra with this dress without worrying it was going to poke out. I love that the inside of the dress felt like flannel. It did ride up a little, but it wasn't too noticeable. I paired it with a black velvet choker and thigh high suede black boots --&#62; sexy sexy",1
1,"This watch did not work. I ordered a replacement which arrived within a few days, but again,it did not work! Will now request a refund.",0
5,very cute and comfortable,1
5,"Nice looking, very reflective. Great laces for the price. Bit stiff but can't complain for the price.",1
5,"Most of the time, when looking for costumes or other various cosplay items, you think about how the fabric might look plastic like or seem easy to rip or break. The fabric on the suit and cape was beyond what I was expecting, and made this costume feel 100% real<br /><br />Am having a Halloween Party next month, gonna blow some minds!",1
5,Loved it. Size is perfect,1
5,Got it as a gift for a teenager who love penguin and she has worn it every single days since we got it for her. It has not broke and does glow in the dark.,1
3,wish it had been a tad larger.,0
1,These are too ting for a 5 1/2,0
1,They feel kinda flimsy for the price. We'll see if the hold up. Material is very soft and cloth like.<br />One month in they are already wearing holes in the heals and toes. Not happy with the quality with the price!,0
5,"Long and flowing super sheer and perfect for the beach.  It's a little long for m.j e.  I'm only 5'4, but it will be pretty easy to hem up.  Excited to wear it with my new bathing suit.",1
2,"Bought a size 2, and the waist is way too big.  Everything else fits fine, except it definitely fits more like skinny jeans than straight fit.  I’m 5’2” and 120 lbs and am normally a size 2-3, so a 2 should not have been fit this poorly.",0
4,My husband really likes them.,1
1,Very disappointed.  Most were broken (cracked) or would not ligh.  I ordered 40 only got 35 and maybe 20 worked.  I have had good luck in the past BUT not this time.  My first graders were disappointed too.,0
3,Feel ripped off,0
5,My daughter loved this. I hung it in the closet and hung her doll's robe next to it and she was over the moon. I soft and fit her age perfectly fine,1
2,The pattern is a pixelated image printed on fabric.,0
4,Nice got compliments especially the cream with buttons ones only wish they stretch a little for people who have big calves,1
3,They are cheap and comfortable. The flair is to small and they constantly just fall out. My last plug stayed in for about 8 years. These fall out unexpectedly. I have lost 9 of them in 4 months.,0
4,"The bottoms do not cover anything, look at customer images before buying to get an idea. That being said at this price it was totally worth it for the top, its looks great on my teenager and she loves it.",1
3,"I like the dress,but the jacket was to small",0
5,Me quedo pequeña en el busto,1
2,Very thin. Not great for winter in N.Y.,0
5,"Beautifully made, quality product. I had to return it because the material was too thick for summer but it is very well made and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cute, non-conventional baptism outfit for their little boy.",1
3,I like them but not good for eye sun cover. I should have gotten dark ones.,0
5,Loved it fir perfect!!,1
3,Very cute earrings but pearl came off after wearing 2 or 3 times.  Very disappointed.,0
5,Great!,1
1,The band is super comfortable but the magnets literally came unglued in less than 3 weeks. Pretty bad considering I've only used this name for about a week total,0
5,I've shopped with Roamans many times through the years so I know exactly what size I wear and how their stuff is made. The top is perfect. I use it for casual days with jeans. It's thin enough for really hot summer days and still thick enough to not be see through.,1
2,Was surprised that this didn't fit like typical swim trunks.  My grandson was actually embarrassed to wear it.,0
1,Not as good as I thought very cheap,0
5,Cute and comfortable.  Help with foot/leg pain when standing for long periods of time.,1
5,"Fit a little small and the material is a little cheap, but still a great deal!",1
3,"The necklace and pendant is cute.  However, there's no message or nice gift box included which really sucks.  I'll have to make my own.",0
1,This ring was crap. Gold plating? Yeah right. My finger turned green which means there's copper hiding in there. The stones weren't glued in right and fell out. Getting water on it made it tarnish. Overall it wasn't worth the money.,0
1,They are very cute but they are thicker than normal earrings and much shorter. Couldn't unscrew all of the backs off.,0
2,"This was not what I expected, especially for what it cost.  I have processed a return.  The clasp is too small for me to be able to open & close it by myself.  I was hoping the adjustable nature of it would allow me to put it on over my head & adjust to shorted length, but not so.  It's so dainty, I'm afraid it would break & as previously stated, the clasp is too small and difficult to open & close.",0
5,tnx,1
2,"The size is great,  but the buttons on the side will not stay fastened.  Kind of a dissapointment",0
2,"Like it, but three days in a gust of wind blew it over and the cheaply made structure holding up the umbrella broke and because its just rivets and cheap aluminum bars, the umbrella won't stay up any more.  The second umbrella torn at a weakly attached point where the arm holds the fabric in place, and the umbrella sags now.  2 umbrellas, almost $350.00 in cost, and three days in, they both are trashed.  Poorly made crap is the order of the day in retails now, and I'm back to using the faded umbrellas I tried to replace.  Better off buying the cheaper brands and throwing them away later.  Thanks for the Chinese garbage umbrellas Le Papillon.",0
3,The quality for the price is good. Not see through so that’s a pulse. But the straps are not the same length so I had to fix them. Not cool,0
5,watch is perfect size and is more beautiful in person.,1
5,Love these earings looks good on me😉,1
5,Love these earrings! They were just as pictures.,1
3,I just a little disappointed it didn’t fit. Wasn’t able to return not going to purchase anytime soon,0
3,The color is not like the picture (see actual picture). Other than that it’s a good dress.,0
3,The size display is not accurate,0
5,It's a little large but as a coverup that's not a problem.  Stylish and comfortable.,1
1,"I didn't expect top shelf product for this price, but I hoped they would last longer than a few days. They are cute and shiny, so the small kids will like them, and they are ok to throw in a goodie bags for kid's party. 4 of them came with the key chain ring broken off. The sequins easily fall out and are not easy to reverse. It's not like the sequin pillows, where the sequins flip easily back and forth. Some of the pieces don't want to reverse at all.",0
1,"These are cheap and ddo not fit the face right<br />CAN""T RETURN!!!!",0
5,good price for good quanlity,1
4,"I love these boots! They’re great for the price and well made, however they run very big. Since they’re lace up and go higher up the calf we made them work.",1
5,"Fit as expected and Comfortable to wear, I love it !It’s good deal for the price ! Fast delivery! Thank you !",1
1,"I am aware of asian sizing but oh my god it was horrible. The tights fit perfect but the top was too small, could barely even get it on. Had to rip it off because I couldn’t get it off.",0
3,Poor fit,0
1,I did not like the quality of these capri tights at all,0
2,"I love the cut and design of this dress, but it is very cheaply made. I wore it once or twice and it looks faded/pilled. The fabric is very light and flimsy. In short: if you want something to wear once, it will probably do the trick, but if you want a wardrobe staple you can wear for a couple of seasons, this will probably not work for you.",0
2,Very nice look but it falls off easily. I had to stick the handles in my hair.,0
5,I love this shirt. It fits lose enough to look closely but not oversized. The material is also very soft and not itchy. I would definitely buy something else from them.,1
3,Tank top was good material. I sized up and it was still a bit small.,0
5,"Its a gift for a daughter, I know she will love it !",1
3,i bought these for our 2 month old daughter and while there ok in price there horrible in value they made her feet hurt and every time she saw them she would cry,0
2,I didn’t want to trust the reviews but it’s true that what was depicted in the picture is very different than the actual product especially at the most important part... the collar and buttons. The real product looks so cheap and the stitching/buttons look like a children’s sewing project.,0
3,I thought I was really going to like this. Seemed cuter than I thought and seemed good quality. The strap broke before I was leaving for my day out and had to wear it. I hid the strap but very disappointed,0
3,"I was a little disappointed with the fabric of this dress, I thought it would be more linen looking.  Cute cut",0
3,It is a simple bracelet of reasonable quality.  It looks like real turquoise.,0
3,"Normally I wear L/XL, but I think a medium would have been closer to the right size for me.  Aside from the sizing issue, this dress in general isn't right for my body type.  If you are pear shaped, it might work for you.  If not, the hip area is cut for wide hips and you'll be left with baggy material on each hip.",0
4,"I like the grey pants. They don’t feel as I expected them to, but I’m still happy with them.<br />Sadly this was the only pair of the 3 I ordered that fit, as expected, or at all.  The other 2 were much smaller than these and so I was forced to give them to my daughter. I think it’s hit or miss on fit.",1
5,I looked everywhere for a grumpy sweatshirt. My husband didn’t like any of them until he saw this one. Just what he wanted!,1
5,FaBO & Perfect godt,1
5,Nice dress.  Looks good with leggings. Covers trouble spots.,1
1,These masks are so big that no one could wear them.  I like the colors and fabric but don't waste your money.  They have no shape to them.  Basically like half a piece of paper shape with big ear straps.,0
5,Pretty,1
2,Was very small and did not breathe well. I was hoping for a lighter drifit material,0
1,"I payed was a size 12, and got tricked!! You gave me a size 11 with a size 12 sticker, and I wonder why they didn't fit and was way too tight!!!!! Never again",0
2,"Had high hopes for this..but meh. The hood is super tiny (looks like a pointy lil gnome hat when you flip it up), has more dark yellows/reds/and browns in the yarn - so it looks much darker, and its much shorter than the picture.<br />Its a nice thick sweater, so it's handy around the house..but ehhh, pretty bummed that it's not really the sweater in the pic.",0
1,"Nylon thread makes this cute lightweight shirt a nightmare. The thin fishing line type thread breaks easily, leaving the tiny stiff ends that make my skin itch. The photos also show how much lint the fabric picks up!",0
1,This product is a piece of junk. Within 1 month the loops that held the straps broke and the purse is unusable. Don’t buy this this product! It’s complete crap.,0
2,These don't really stick all that well. Can't use them.,0
4,"Cheap looking fabric, but super cute and what I expected.",1
1,"Don’t buy, The eye shields appear ton have been opened, have fingerprints and possibly used.  The strings are various conditions, some knotted on ends, some tied in a loop. I would never consider using this item to protect my eye following cataract surgery, possibly contaminated.",0
5,"I LOVE this dress! it's so flattering.<br /><br />I've worn it with a purple colored bra and it still wasn't that see through. It's very flattering to a curvy shape and even if you are large chested, it doesn't make the dress ride up. The skirt is a perfect length that hits at the knees. It looks awesome without a sweater/cardigan too.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!",1
2,Zipper pull came off on one side of the purse.<br />I had to manually pull the zipper apart.<br />No way to fix the zipper,0
3,Good quality but I don’t like shirts with a lot of ink on the front. It makes it heavy and sweaty.,0
5,"I'm 5'8"" and 203 lbs<br />My waist isn't too big but my bust is and it fits perfectly. My job is a physical one and this helps keep my cool and I don't have to worry about my uniform riding up",1
5,These shoes are very cute!,1
1,I wish I could give it a zero star it’s less then paper then might as well just use a piece of tissue paper the thin kind that be in Walmart restrooms... but the price should honestly tell you you get what you pay for,0
5,Adorable! Bought them as a gift for my 8 year old.  They are perfect size for a child without compromising details of the design.,1
5,I like this shirt!,1
1,Back of snaps came off the first time I wore them and behind the snaps the fabric was unraveling,0
5,This has taken my work travel bag from being a hot mess of stuff everywhere to one quick easy to find organized solution.,1
2,"The top was extremely too small.  Needed a size 12 for an extremely thin daughter and it fit our extremely thin size 6 daughter.  Although the shorts fit as expected, I was disappointed in the quality.",0
3,The outfit is absolutely adorable and feels so soft! The only complaint I have is the headband. The “headband” is just a string of fabric that I have no idea how to tie.,0
1,"These are really soft and I love the purple color, BUT I am a size 10 with long legs and I ordered a 12 just to make sure they were extra ""baggy"".  But these sucked to my legs and waist.  They fit more like a size 2 on me.",0
5,I love this watch. It is shiny and exactly what I was looking for! Simple styling and elegant looking. Great price too.,1
5,Excelente,1
3,it does its job its a little big at the back and arms and im not to fond of the material its made of but it yeah i like it oh it also moves with me like if i tense up my shoulders it creats a bump almost plus you might want to remove the tag because it makes a lot of noise,0
5,nice quality,1
2,It was much shorter than I expected.  Had to return it.,0
4,"I am a huge fan of wrap rings and this one is my favorite!  It isn't too heavy given the amount of crystals on it and I like the green crystals for the eyes. I was a bit nervous it would look cheap but was pleasantly surprised after receiving it to find that it actually does look like something you would get in a jewelry store. The rose gold has a nice warm tone and doesn't look brassy at all.<br /><br />I did have two small complaints. First, I lost a crystal right off the top of the ring shortly after I got it. Second, the rose gold platoon is wearing off a little on the inside of he band. I do wear the ring everyday so it could simply be the heavy use it is subjected to. I think it would be handy if the seller provided a few spare stones withy the purchase for the sake of replacing any that go missing.<br /><br />I received a discounted sample of the product for my unbiased and honest review.",1
1,"I shall re-order these, however what I had disliked was that I received the wrong size",0
5,Really good material for the price!,1
1,Do NOT buy anything from this Co. I purchased 2 pants $25.00 each $50.00 total waited over 1 month to receive them. I order them 1 size up and still did not fit. I request a refund and they offer only to refund me $4.16 for both pants and that i could keep the pants. THEY DON'T FIT!!!  They stopped communicating with me once I told them that they have a return policy. Pants look nice on picture but they're not what you get. Avoid wasting your $$ with this company.,0
2,"Ordered a size up and it was way too big up top and still too small around my hips. Material was what you would expect for a $16 dress. It's cute, but only if you're built like the model.",0
1,Not a cute fit at all.,0
5,"Love the feel of these earrings...light, smooth, yet substantial, not flimsy.",1
1,"The picture looks nice however the quality was poor. When I open the earring to but them on the closer was not secure, I could see problems in the furture. I was affraid it would break off. I returned them right away with no problems.",0
4,"To me the Ldriance CZ & bar is a hit. You get two trendy necklaces (complementary designs) for the price of one. One is a bar and the other is a circle. They can be worn together or separately. They are dainty and very feminine. They are 14kt gold plated pieces, and I did not notice any irritation to my skin. These necklaces are nickel free and hypoallergenic. They can be worn casually or dressy. They are super cute, fun and reasonably priced.  I’d recommend these for yourself or someone else.",1
3,"Perfect fit comfortable, I only wish material was higher quality. Material is too synthetic.",0
1,Stain on earrings,0
1,Poorly made. One leg came apart as I was trying it in.,0
1,"Answer: When it comes to sandals, almost anything.  These rubbed my instep raw, my toes catch on the toe box, and the heel pads seem misaligned.  Even at the sale price of 29.95 (there is a reason they are so cheap), a waste of money.  Bummer.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a slightly used pair?",0
5,Very nice! Quick shipping!,1
5,Love my new bands and I was so surprised at how quick I received them after I ordered them.<br />They are very comfortable and price is good,1
5,Good product,1
5,Every time I wear a long sleeve sweater I find myself pushing the arms up because they annoy me.  These garters are great and a great price for the three colors. No more annoyance.,1
4,"After reading the reviews I decided to order a small because I wanted a more snug fit. It was perfect. I am 5’6” and around 145 athletic build. I typically wear medium shirts if I want baggy or small if I want a snug fit and a size 8-10 jeans depending on brand. It is very well made and seems like it will be very warm. The green color is not the same as in the photo but is more of a sage green. It also is a bit lop-sided at the neck because of the buttons, but the style is still cute.",1
5,Perfect,1
3,see through!,0
3,Bottoms run small! Very cute suit but I won't be able to use the bottoms. They are tiny. I am 5'5&#34; 135 lbs size 8. The medium bottoms were way to small. I should be able to use the top however.,0
1,I wear a medium which I ordered and I could not get the pants up my legs. Way too small.,0
5,Super comfortable and cute. I just got back from a beach vacation.,1
4,"I bought this to replace the rubber strap on my Casio MDV-106 diver watch (outstanding watch, by the way).  I've put a couple watchbands on in the past, but I just couldn't get the pins to seat correctly.  I took it to my jeweler, who charged $10 to install the band and an additional $5 to size it.  The jeweler told me that he had to bend the spring pins slightly, because the holes on the strap ends don't line up perfectly with the holes on the watch case.  This means that I have a somewhat weak connection between the watch and the band, and it won't last for a long, long time like it's supposed to.  But -- it's a $12 watch band, it doesn't feel as solid or sturdy as other steel straps I've used (Bulova and Invicta), and I don't expect it to last forever anyway.  When this band fails, I'll probably just put the original rubber strap back on.  Good value for the money, but I won't buy this again -- not for this watch, anyway.",1
5,I bought this for my work ID.  This comes with so many charms that I can change out to get a different look every day for a couple of weeks.  Love it!,1
5,"I should have ordered a large, but I washed it and its now a large. Really cute!",1
5,cute necklace it glows in dark for the money its not bad but it is made cheaply. I do love how it glows in the dark,1
1,"Shorts are not well made. Almost 60 days to the day the fabric after only the 2nd wear and 1 wash, started to spread apart, kinda like a spider web. Also along the belt loops there are little holes as well that I am sure after a period of time would only expand. I ordered these through Amazon, sold by 6PM. Amazon was gracious to accept the return outside of 30 days.",0
1,"I order the same size in this type of clothing all the time, these were too big",0
2,"The necklace is beautiful. A great bargain. The earrings are pretty, but cannot open to insert scent pad.",0
3,"I like the style of the boots, but they seem to buckle a lot like cheaply made boots.",0
4,Pretty much what we were looking for and expected.,1
2,This is definitely not long. Its the length of a normal T-shirt so it isn't great for leggings. Super disappointed. I would've given it 4 stars if it were as described.,0
5,These gloves are awesome! They're comfortable and good quality. They fit on your hands nicely and snuggly. They are overall fantastic gloves that I would definitely recommend to a friend.,1
2,Hard to adjust the length. Took me almost one hour to remove the third block. The first two was relatively easier.<br /><br />Cannot find the word Japan on the package or the watch itself.<br />Why would someone advertise it as &quot;Japan...&quot;?!,0
5,Great pair of glasses,1
5,Comfy,1
5,This is my favorite cap. Not the first I have ordered and won't be the last. I am pleased with both the seller and Amazon.,1
2,Way too small! Wasn't worth sending back though. This went into garbage!,0
4,"It’s comfortable and has lasted me several months however lately I’ve outgrown them. (18 almost 19). I used to be a size 36C and when to a 36D. They still fit but when I do lots of activists they don’t stay in place as much as they used too. Overall great product. Ordering the right size is key, and ordering a size bigger might help at least in my case it did.",1
3,"There are better Goku costumes out there but this one gets the job done. Let's begin with the pants. The pants are comfortable and lightweight, perfect for walking around a convention or party, a very relaxed fit. Next up is the shirt. The shirt is a little odd, the blue under shirt is attached to the orange overshirt. It's a little itchy and feels awkward to wear. The material for both the shirt and pants is a little cheap but is pretty comfortable for the most part. The wristbands are pretty dumb, they were way to big for my wrists and are secured with velcro. The belt is ok, it's a little on the short side but overall it's fine. This is a good costume for a one or two day event, it's not very durable or comfortable but it looks pretty.",0
1,Print was cracked on arrival..and small fit,0
5,I love these adorable headbands!  They arived fast and were a great deal.,1
2,"I ordered the dress in black, but I was sent one in gray instead, so I will be returning it and I won't order a new one. I found the material to be too tight and somewhat cheap-looking. It clung to the hip and thigh area in a way that was unflattering and the material was too thin, meaning I couldn't wear the dress by itself. I was disappointed, as I was really looking forward to wearing this dress.",0
4,This dress is a lot shorter than pictured. The slit actually goes up so far you can see my butt cheeks. It was just a tad bit tight (for me) but others might be comfortable with the fit. Actually a lot nicer than I was expecting.,1
1,The mask headband was broken from the ear loops. Poor quality manufacturing. The fit is not accurate and runs very small. This mask is not made for working out.<br />Do not recommend.,0
5,Product as expected. Great for going out or lounging,1
5,Very cute on trend!,1
5,I love this dress. The material is soft and comfortable. Not see-through; I love wearing these long dresses at home but can be worn outside as well. Want to buy again in other colors.,1
2,This hat fell apart after I packed it in my luggage to take in vacation. It's very delicate. Don't pack it!!,0
5,Lovely design and colors,1
1,Watch was not working when I got it,0
2,Ties are skinny and small.,0
3,"I loved the look of this dress, and when it arrived it was even prettier.  I'm a size 8 and ordered a Med.  When I put it on, everything below the bust was skin tight.  I looked pregnant.  Even going up to a Large wouldn't have fixed the cut of this dress.  If you are tall and slender, this dress will look nice on you.  If you're like the remaining 95% of women out here, this dress won't work.  Every extra pound shows, and the fabric is unforgiving.",0
1,"received wrong item.<br />Ordered a XL and receide a medium<br />quality is not the best, but we expect better for this price.<br />anyway is size was correct the deal was not too bad...anyway not recommended",0
5,"Cute, cute, cute...",1
1,This dress is not true to size.  It is much smaller.  Order at least 2 sizes larger to fit as shown in the picture.  There is no “give” or elasticity to the fabric.,0
2,Does not work for me.,0
2,Came with a hole in seam,0
4,"As previously mentioned, if you want the bottoms to fit, the top may be a little large. I have not needed to sew anything, but I notice the top is slightly looser than other tops. It is not a big deal due to the sport cut though.<br /><br />I love the design and got compliments from friends and family on it.",1
1,The fabric is soft but thin. If you are XS definitely choose a Small size.,0
2,"The size is smaller than the actual size. If your size is small, purchase midum.",0
1,"what is going on with this shirt? is it a belly shirt? the girl in the picture isnt showing her abs.  the arms and chest fit great, the back was perfect, the front was HIGH CUT! what the heck?",0
1,I was hugely disappointed. I wanted to wear this for at paddys day but it is not suited for someone of my age. Looks like it came out of a quarter machine. Will find a kid that may like it.,0
4,I like this bag because it is the right size to carry what I need and I like the long straps to easily get it on my shoulder. It also seems to be made of good quality materials. The only drawback I have found is that the shoulder straps are also a nylon-type material and they slip off the shoulder if I am wearing and kind of other slippery material (such as nylon).,1
5,"Bought these off another site, I normally wear a 7 but bought a 6.5 they were huge,,,, back door bought a sz 6 and were way to small,,,, geeesh",1
3,"After about two weeks the black wore off the corners in another couple of months it will look like a total POS, and I’ll have to get a different band. Not 80 buck worth.",0
1,"First off it took almost two weeks to receive this item. So that's already a negative hit. This item is extremely cheap. It's almost see through. I wanted it oversized so I got a 2x and I wear 12. The 2x fit like an 8. I am definitely returning this. This is my first item I needed to return to Amazon. I was looking forward to getting this turtleneck and I am totally disappointed. Oh well, lessons learned.",0
4,Very pretty but 1 corner at the top came apart so its not a straight line,1
1,The rose gold color does not match my watch. Returning.,0
3,"Would be awesome, but its kinda short in length and the supports in the back bow out making it luck terrible with anything snug fitting",0
3,Hard to keep tight enough... My daughter loves the bracelet but she is afraid to lose it.,0
5,Does what it says,1
5,"Absolutely love these!! I bought two because the reviews looked good, and I’m so glad I took that risk. They’re super comfy, flattering, and fit super true to size. Totally suck in the tummy, but not in an uncomfy way. Worth every cent.",1
1,Not for me. Made me look like a stuffed teddy bear. Also description of item was incorrect. This is a hoody not cardigan.,0
5,My bud loved it and wears it every chance he gets,1
1,"When I first tried on these shirts I loved them! fit nice and felt nice, but the material is really ""slickery"" and there is not enough stretch to keep it in place so the bottom hem is constantly riding up, having to tug it down back over my waistband, only to ride up again.  It either needs to be a little less slippery or have a little more hug/stretch so they stay in place.",0
5,"Exactly what I needed for reading in the sun. I do not wear everyday glasses, just readers so it took some time to get used to these.  It is difficult to wear these for everyday activities outside but that was not why I purchased these. The bifocal lens is not too noticeable from the front.",1
5,Loved to color and style just too small to meet my needs.,1
5,Love this wallet.  I have downsized on my handbags and this wallet is perfect.  Very nice quality and I love the color.  I can find easily.,1
2,The quality is not there.,0
5,Complete and Cute! Always lots of compliments!,1
2,This is a super cute dress but it was made so small that I had to return it.,0
4,Love the color. Fits as expected.,1
5,❤️❤️❤️,1
1,"Not what I expected,",0
1,Ew this was the ugliest dress. Fits like a potato sack with elastic in the middle! Sent it back right away.,0
5,The pouches fit most any pair of sunglasses and are a good cloth to clean the lenses.,1
3,Ok,0
5,"Didn't know what to expect buying this dress because of the material but I have to say, I LOVE IT!  I ordered the Large size (160 lbs. 36B) My first time leaving a review.",1
1,Too small. Does not fit normal American fingers. I wouldn't buy these at all. Not recommended. They don't really offer the ring size. They just send really small rings that will only fit your pinkys. Cute if you have small fingers,0
5,This is very noticeable! I highly recommend it for Dialysis Patients like myself,1
3,They were very heavy,0
4,Nice,1
2,Fitted. Very heavy weighing on my shoulders. I dont Like how much it hurts pulling me down. Good for workouts i guess But it rides up.,0
5,Bought for my granddaughter. She loves it!,1
1,Very cheap quality,0
5,Perfect,1
5,Love these.. super comfy my daughter said!,1
5,I wish they came in more colors. but they are worth it,1
5,Gorgeous colors! My daughter was thrilled.,1
1,"Very cheep looking.  Great for a young kid playing house with her tiny tea cups, butvwouldnt recoment a women wearing it out in public.",0
3,It's smaller than I thought<br />for the price it's good,0
3,"Look good, feel well made. Only problem for me is the arms are not long enough, making it uncomfortable on my ears. Not for all large heads.",0
4,Comfortable,1
1,"Cap is not comfortable to wear. The cap comes off my head. It's my opinion its over priced,  and doesn't fit my head (I don't have a big head).",0
3,"I LOVE this but I couldn't figure out how to get into it.  The concealed zip helped, but I am way too big.  RETURNED SADLY :(",0
4,"Nice materials, just too small for my curvy and extra padded bottom. The waist line fits, but the shorts are made for straight legged, no butt women.",1
4,These are warm and very cute. God two different pairs. My daughter has slightly thicker thighs. One pair was tight in the thighs and the other pair fit perfectly. Ordered a third hair and those fit perfectly as well..,1
3,"Made my fingers green. Pretty jewelry, though",0
5,Fit perfectly. Stayed on all night.,1
5,"I have wanted a silver umbrella for awhile, finally got it and this one is HUGE!  I forgot that golf umbrellas are so big, but this is perfect for my actors to sit under while I set up film sets inbetween shoots (especially in the hot STG, Utah heat!).  Thanks!",1
3,"looks great, i just hate that even when the straps are tight they keep falling of my shoulder, and when you move around you hear a weird squeak. the bra itself is pretty cute.",0
5,"At first, I ordered a L, but returned it for an XL. I loved the colors and the material so I didn’t want to give up! The XL is perfect.",1
5,Very comfortable!,1
5,Great fit. I needed a dress quickly for a semi formal banquet. Arrived on time. The lace is beautiful. Surprisingly is wasn't to wrinkly despite arriving folded up in an envelope. This is my new little black dress. I'll buy a petticoat the next time I wear it to give it some lift.<br />I'm 5'7'' and about 135lbs and bought a small.,1
1,Looked and felt life plastic. Made that crunching noise when moving as well.,0
1,Runs really small.,0
2,Fits fine. Sweatshirt is NOT the style in picture. It is extremely soft but does not look anything like the picture shown. The print is the sane but absolutely not the same sweatshirt style.,0
2,"I really liked the idea of these shoes but they are so wide that I'm not sure they would fit any child's foot. My daughter wears a 10 toddler in shoes and while these were just a tad long, they were extremely wide. Sent both pairs back.",0
5,"These are amazing sunglasses. They do not slide off even when face gets sweaty. They also don’t squeeze my head, whereas other sunglasses give me headaches if they’re too tight. Would buy again!!!",1
5,"For the price I was skeptical about these and the fact that they aren’t water proof. But when they arrived they look really really nice. They are going to be used as “going out” boots instead of work boots for my fiancé. He said they did feel just a little stiff but perhaps after wearing them more they’ll loosen up. I think for the price listed here, they are worth it.",1
5,"Good quality, well made and fits nicely. My daughter is starting dance again this summer and had grown out of her other leotards. She wanted something with a skirt attached. This is nice and will work great for both her ballet class as well as her jazz class since they run back to back. Good piece for the price.",1
2,I return the Life Stride because it was too big and not padded comfortably.,0
5,Everything was good and I love the feel of the outside,1
2,"It's okay, but not sure where you can wear this. Very thin material. If you decide to wear a bra or underwear with this you will definitely see it.",0
5,Love the fit of this! I have worn it twice already and am going to buy another one in different pattern.,1
2,After 30 days they no longer hold.  The clamps are weak.,0
1,cheap material,0
4,I’ve always worn briefs in the past but I started to wear boxer-briefs and I’m liking it.  I normally wear size Medium but decided to buy size Large instead and I’m glad I did.  Size Medium would have been too tight for me.  Size Large fits me well.  The material is of high quality and is very comfortable on my skin.  The design and look is cool but not really that important to me.  Shipping is free but did take a while.  This is not a big deal to me because I was not in a rush to receive these underwear.  I received this product at discount for my honest review.,1
5,Fantastic. Runs small.,1
1,Pros:<br />- dress seemed well made and comfortable for the price<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Small fit more like a large -- long in all proportions and very wide in hips. I'm 5'3 and the dress came @ 3&#34; below knees; bust and waist curves were low too; had about 3-4&#34; of extra fabric on either side of hips -- plus dress' natural stretchiness)<br />- Red color ordered was very clearly a hot pink color. Pretty color but in no way red.<br /><br />Disappointed because I needed a red dress for holiday family photos.,0
1,Only received 4 bands and only 2 of the colors shown.,0
2,"Purchased these along side a set of David Archy boxers as well. Granted I knew the David Archy's would be a step up, these were mediocre at best. The fit was just a tad small not horrible, and after 2-3 washes they seem to start unraveling on the seams. The feel is also what you expect for a cheaper pair of boxers, rough cotton doesn't feel great after a day of work. The ones that have held up I will continue to use and see how long they all hold up. I have 2 of the 4 left currently.",0
4,"I'm 6ft athletic built and all legs, and this dress fit me well and was surprised by the length. I had to get a bigger size for it to be longer, so it does not fit me well along the waist as I would like it, however, I would still definitely wear this out and about on a casual day.",1
5,"I purchased this bag for my daughter to use for volleyball, she absolutely loves it. Perfect little gift for her new sport.",1
4,Nice garment. It really holds you in without being noticeable. The lace at the thighs make this undetectable in tight clothing. Seems very quality. Good compression. Gives your booty a lift and shapes nicely. It fits seem to run a bit large so order 1 size smaller than your normal size. This did not roll down. It has boning to prevent that. Really nice shaper.,1
3,Did not work out for us. Didn't fit right. Very square like cut. Got a refund no issues.,0
5,"Purchased these earring for my daughter to go with her Elsa Halloween costume.  They are beautiful.  She just loves them, especially the fact they can be tightened or loosened as needed.  They also arrived sooner than expected.  Great purchase.",1
5,"Very nice looking. Has a substantial feel to it, not cheap at all.",1
3,"This is really a pretty skirt and the fabric seems like a good quality.  Unfortunately I have to return be I'm 5'2 and it's way too long. I would've hemmed it but even though the fabric has some give, the waist has no stretch at all and I just found it really uncomfortable.",0
3,"I ordered this clutch wallet solely on its description of 10 inches in length. That's what I was in need of. Not only does the height not quite measure up to the description, but the length is off by a bit over two inches. I can't use an 8 inch clutch wallet. Had I known, I wouldn't have wasted my time.",0
3,"Nice product if you’re taller. Really not sized for us short girls. Everyone at the hospital wears them, they love the support.",0
2,to loose in the leg...it does not hug the leg,0
5,Amo Stride Rite,1
5,Our 13 year old daughter loves cats and was so excited to receive this item as a gift. She says this is her Saturday Lounge outfit and wears it every weekend super warm!,1
3,"This purse is cute, but it just looks so fake. I got no compliments on this purse whatsoever. Really disappointed.",0
4,"It is a good dress for the price. The fabric is thin and breathable, which allows the wind to catch the skirt. I have to keep readjusting the top so that my bust stays covered without seeing the seam from the panel underneath. I will wear this dress often, it can be dressed up with accessories or kept casual.",1
5,Nice little key chain.,1
5,beauitful clutch and great price,1
3,Beautiful color. Chiffon like material. But way way way too small,0
5,Great purse! Exactly what I wanted.,1
5,Fits great and it is really pretty.,1
5,Loved it and my daughter is super happy.,1
4,I bought them for our vacation. You delivered early! Thanks. They fit and look fine. Going home soon and may need to buy something warmer.<br />:),1
2,It was not as full as I would have liked it and thought it would be,0
1,Once I got them on I couldnt get them off. I had to cut them off.,0
1,"Shirt was cute and fit well but the edges of the shoulder openings, sleeves and bottom were not sewn and left raw. Looks very cheap!",0
3,I love it!,0
1,The purse is cute but the shiny material is coming off. This makes the purse a waste of money and ugly.,0
5,This is beautiful necklace that is very well made and the stone is so pretty and colorful.  I have received so many compliments whenever I wear it.,1
5,It fits great. Fabric is a little on thin side so better with leggings or shorts under so it's not see through.,1
1,The dress was a shapeless wide box. I was disappointed. I donated it to  Salvation Army.,0
5,"If you want longer sleeves, order a size up! It fits well otherwise. The sleeves aren't too short - not so short I would bother exchanging the one I got, but if I order another one, I'll get a medium. Even so, I'm happy with my purchase.",1
3,This is cute but I ordered an xl and though it closes its snug and not comfortable... should of ordered 2 sizes up ugh,0
5,Comfortable light weight excellent for use with computer screen.,1
1,Zipper broke after 2 months. Disappointed 😔,0
3,"The jacket is awesome, but the zipper sucks. I would return the jacket if I could. It's very comfortable and looks great, but the zipper killed it for me.",0
5,"Best du rag I’ve ever purchased! It’s so light and comfortable plus it holds down my hair. Doesn’t leave lines across the forehead like other Du rags (I use the no knot method)...only critique is the color isn’t as rich as it is in the photo, they are more dull colored. But still an awesome rag.",1
5,Love it,1
1,"These earrings are very pretty.  However, they had the very worse clasp I have ever experienced and didn't stay shut from day one.  I couldn't return because I lost the packaging.",0
5,"I loved this!! At first I was hesitant due to the mixed reviews but I decided to give it a shot and see for myself. For me, for the price you pay, it is of great quality!! I got the blue one in a large (I am 5'5, 150 lbs and a C cup) and it fit perfectly! I got a size up just to be safe and I suggest others doing the same, you can always adjust the straps if it sits too low. The material is super soft and stretchy and when it came out of the clear ziploc style package, it did not have that plastic smell whatsoever! Smells like any clothing item you'd get at any clothing store if that matters for some because it did to me. Anyways, all in all, I loved the product, super comfortable, fit well, great price, great soft and stretchy quality, and the man loved it on me!",1
5,Comfortable and fits well,1
1,Doesn't at all fit like the photo,0
5,Love this shirt!,1
1,I would give zero stars if I could. This strap is NOT as described. It is not blue its purple! Very unhappy and returned it immediately.,0
5,Wow. Wish I bought these years ago.  Great idea!!!  Everything is organized and easy to find.  No unpacking and repacking when taking something out of suitcase.  Quality is very good.<br />I will buy more for friends.,1
4,Arrived ontime.,1
5,"Feels good , love the camper design , and was delighted when promised.",1
3,"Worked well, however it did start to wear on the corners. My wife uses it very lightly always keeps it in her pocket but is still wore. Excellent customer service, they replace it right away hopefully the new one will last longer.",0
1,"Have lots of Lucky dresses but this one was a real disappointment, it has absolutely no shape and the material looked cheap and nasty.<br />Sending it back.",0
4,Pants were a little square.,1
1,"the white ones had specs in them like they were made in a dirty mold, and the flares were all rough and had extra stuff hanging off of them. They were also SUPER hard not squishable at all",0
5,"Loved it, was a friend for a co-worker and she collects scarfs. Thanks a bunch!!!",1
2,Very large! It was also an itchy polyester material that is rough. I will return.,0
5,"Love the glasses. Well made product and less expensive through amazon than in CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",1
2,cute but cheap quality,0
5,Easy to access and I can find what I am looking for easily.,1
1,I ordered the green skirt .... it was not the same skirt shown on the picture ... it was pleated and loose fitted.,0
5,"These leggings are so soft and comfortable. Perfect for lounging around the house. They will quickly become my lounge around the house leggings! The color is fun, and I wish I had the black for working out.",1
1,Ordered March 17th. Broke May 5th. Horrible quality. Don’t waste your money. Post completely separated from pearl.,0
5,"I bought 20+ of these to use for a dance performance group. They looked very pretty, just a little inconsistent with the sizes/lengths and sometimes the exact material/colors.",1
5,"I LOVE this dress! It is great quality, soft, and fits amazing. For the price, this is a great piece to add to your closet.",1
5,"This style is so hard to find in stores these days...but they are super comfy, and they are reasonably priced.",1
1,"Waste of money! I bought this purse and in just 3 weeks of using it, the straps are hanging on by threads on BOTH sides. Not just one side, but BOTH. I don’t know they have bad batches of bags made or what, but 3 weeks is ridiculous for it to be falling apart like this. I really liked the look of this bag and the storage, but really let down to see it fall apart so quickly and it was a watch of money for me.",0
3,Necklace is about 16 inches.  It has a nice color and sheen.  Great for a pendant or charm worn infrequently.,0
5,"Well, like many reviewers on here, my mask was ""not as advertised."" Yes, the bottom of the eye holes appear at the top of the mask. Just adjust the mask up if you REALLY need it to align to your face. The product itself is high quality, very stretchable as it fits over my big head to rest snuggly on my neck. The drawstring ensures you get a cozy fit on your face without over doing it. I've used it as a mask, a full hood, and a neck cooler (dip it in ice water). Very happy with my purchase.",1
3,They were very cute. They were just a little big for my small face even after tightening the ear bands. They fogged my glasses up a lot no matter the position. I could feel the air hit my eyes when I breathed. I really wanted them to work out.,0
1,Normally can wear a medium or large so as others said i ordered up in fact i ordered XL to be safe. It is just too tight and too small probably would need a 2xl if it were for medium,0
4,Very good,1
2,Wore this for a 90s party and it’s a crop top. Fit way smaller than I’d like but still cute,0
2,The size chart is way off on this item. A XXL is about a medium in USA sizes. Suit is made very well and the pattern is beautiful but is for very small women.,0
2,"It looks better in the picture, its fragile and looks really cheap, it broke as soon as i open it...",0
1,"I got a small and it fits like a large, way to baggy and crappy stitching. Save your money and get something else.",0
3,"I liked the shape and all, but it was way to big for me, I thought they were going to be smaller. And they slid right off my nose, I mean I have a small nose but those rubber stoppers should do the trick, I think they were just too heavy.",0
1,The evil eye fell off the necklace 2 hours after wearing it. Won't bother ordering another one.,0
5,Perfect if I don’t have pierced ears. A few broke but for the most part they are good,1
1,I took a star off for each problem so thats why it was rated 1star. 1 Upon opening the package the smell of the dress is horrible. 2 the crystals is not sewn on the dress it comes on a ribbon thats close in colour but obviously not the same colour. 3 the crystals on the ribbon are loose and falling off and lastly 4 the dress has a lot of loose threading and what appears to be wires sticking out. Hope this helps potential buyers,0
5,The fabric is a thick material. It is a little see through at the bottom but should be fine with nude underwear. It fits very well! I was very pleased with the way it is made and how it looks on me. I will be wearing it for my wedding shower in May.,1
4,"I'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and the small was a liiittle too big. If you're anythig below a C cup the top will not fit you at all. That being said, the colors are beautiful and the material is definitely neoprene!",1
2,it's cute. just what I wanted. but it tarnishes to much,0
3,It is a lot bigger then what it shows on the picture. I’m a female and it is more for a male. I thought it would of been thinner than what it actually is.,0
5,Beautiful dress. Perfect fit. I am short so the dress even though expected was a bit longer for me . Nothing a quick hem couldn't fix.,1
3,"I ordered a size 7m which is a half size smaller than my usual size.  A previous reviewer mentioned they ran big.  The length was just right, but the width was so narrow a child could barely fit into it.  In the 10 minutes I had these on, the dye from the suede tinted my hands and feet black.  The style is cute, and I can tell if they were a good fit they'd be a super comfy shoe.  The buttons are also just pinned on so you can change them out to bedazzle the shoe with whatever you're feeling that day.",0
5,So soft! Love the material and length is perfect,1
3,"I'm 5'6. 135ish lbs Athletic. C cup. I got a medium. The top was kind of big bit fit. The bottoms, however, were SMALL. I DONT have a booty. I'd say I'm average, but I couldn't keep the bottoms on, they kept wanting to come down because they were so tight.",0
3,"Smaller than I expected.  They are not 10mm as advertised, but maybe 9 or 8mm.  They should be fine, however.",0
1,It’s an adult mask!,0
5,Awsome,1
2,Very nice sock and they stayed on.  Unfortunately the first time I wore the black pair a hole developed above my big toe.  I take a size 7 shoe so my foot shouldn’t have happened.,0
5,"This shirt is so soft and comfortable, and I love the color! It's a slinky material so it can worn as casual or dressy depending on what you pair it with. I got a small; it hangs a little loose, but not oversized.",1
1,Do not waste your money. It appears like the company threw something together. The product is poorly made snd there is no support. I returned them,0
5,Good quality for the price,1
2,The slots for cards are top loading...not on inside seam like I am used to...do not feel that they would hold upper row of cards safely...expected better from Buxton brand.,0
5,Very comfortable<br />Very stylish,1
4,Good quality. Run really big. I ordered for a 2 year old and these would fit a 6year old,1
2,The fabric is very thin and  has more like an outer raincoat feel. Its also very tight at the wrists. I was disappointed in the quality,0
5,She loved it.  Nice box presentation too. I would buy it again,1
3,Very small. Fit like a child large. My husband is 6ft 185 lbs,0
1,Coat look like a plastic trash bag material,0
5,Love the shoes,1
5,Item was purchased for my daughter's Halloween costume. She wears 6-9 months and it fit great! Great quality,1
3,Sizing is off a full size.  I ordered a size 5 and wear a 4.5.  Ring is WAY too tight.,0
5,My Grandaughter loved this set & fit perfect,1
5,i wear them alot...,1
1,These are the 3rd ones I've bought this year! I love how they look but the freaking screws keep popping out!,0
5,I ordered an adult XL and I got an youth XL. I gave it to my son and it fits him perfectly. So in that aspect it fits perfectly.,1
5,I love these hoops! I bought 3 completely different hoops and I wish I just bought 3 different pairs of these! They are not to big and they feel and look like high quality. Also the lock on the back is super easy to use and stays locked even if you sleep in them.,1
5,My boxing gloves look great in the cases. Great product. Would definitely buy again!,1
5,"Quality product, don't be fooled by the easily peeled plastic, it's there as protection before it gets to you; I was initially concerned about it until I realized the quality of the product.",1
5,Love the color and it's so soft to the touch.,1
3,Bought this “shirt” cause the description said it was a dress.  But it fit like a shirt.  The hi-low effect was too high in the front and waaay long in the back.  We still wore it. But with leggings.,0
2,"Misleading and ok, nothing special",0
2,It was a gift and to me it was cheap looking and feeling.,0
3,much bigger than expected,0
5,Granddaughter loved it.,1
1,bad,0
4,Sparkly worth the money,1
5,Easy to wear and protective as well.,1
5,kind of thin but i guess that's how these types of socks are supposed to be,1
3,Glasses look nice but too wide on the nose bridge area.,0
2,If your feet swell don’t buy. If you order a size up they’ll still be close on the toe. They’re just meh,0
5,Love. Love. LOVE this dress. Great material and great fit! Will definitely buy multiple,1
5,"I love Felina leggings! They fit so well and are so soft. I have purchased 6 pairs. They look great with a sweatshirt or a nice tunic. Dress up, casual or athletic, they are my favorite.",1
2,Material is not structured like the picture. Thin and cheap looking.,0
3,The bathing suit itself is nice but the sizing is way off. I'm a 34-36 D and the XL was way to small. Size 10 pants and the bottom fit fine.,0
1,"Bra is great except for the straps don't adjust as other bras do for shoulders. Therefore it tends to ride up my back, very uncomfortable. And I'm not big, only a 36b. So id send back but already threw all packaging away. Would not buy this again.",0
3,Not much to say about this one.,0
4,"I purchased the spice color and it is truly beautiful and well made. The closure is reliable and durable. My only issue is that when there are items in all the slots, cash and coin holders the wallet is FULL. There is no room for extra stuff (I like to put my receipts in my wallet when I shop) so I gave this wallet four stars instead of five because before I can put anything else in it I will have to take something out. Maybe the leather will stretch over time and give me a little more space for stuff when I am out and about, like receipts/stamps, business cards, etc.",1
5,[[VIDEOID:49e955f42cf2d8a0c8ed4e2198b4a1c9]] Beautiful and great price! Just as pictured arrived securely packaged and undamaged. High sparkle.,1
1,"I ordered Grace Karin XL retro high waisted black shorts with 4 buttons down the middle. What i got was a cheap ugly pair from Belle Poque that can barelt pass as high waisted. Has 3 bottons down one side, 4 down the other and has a side zip closure. BEYOND disappointed!",0
2,"Fast delivery and absolutely loved them!! They kept falling down and the 3rd time I wore them, one broke. I'm very sad to say they didn't last long. Best thing to do is wear them down like regular earrings.",0
3,Does not come with the interchangeable lens,0
2,I ordered 12-18 mo size and its way too small. Everything else I've bought in that age range fits him or is slightly too big. Waste of money.,0
5,like it,1
2,"Followed the sizing chart and bought the size suggested for my husband but they were still one size too small. For those who are thicker around the middle, please consider going up a size to the one suggested by the chart.",0
5,The dress well fitted my girlfriend and she likes it. I think the medium size is a normal medium American size and if you really know you're a medium size don't hesitate to order it cause it will fit you very well.,1
3,Loses threads FAST! As soon as you put it over your head you hear the threads breaking.... Great patterns... terrible stitching. Sadly I missed the return window.,0
2,"I received this coat and did not like it. The hood seems like it has stiff paper inside, and it has permanent folds and creases. I think I would have to stuff something in it to make it work. I found another Six coat on Amazon and it is SO much better. This one is also a weird green instead of yellow. I hate the hood and the color, basically.",0
2,A lot of the reviews mentioned the tees breaking easy...they do! They are cheap enough that if you wanted tees with a patriotic theme you can buy them but they do break easy. Figure on 2 to 4 tees breaking per round.,0
2,These fit very tight and snug and are difficult to remove.<br /><br />I usually wear x-large latex/nitrile glove.<br /><br />These are definitely suitable for washing dishes and other household chores. They can protect from heat of the hot water.,0
2,The shirt was suppose to be black but it was blue an that was disappointing.,0
5,Beautiful watch!,1
4,Order two sizes up.,1
4,Nice for a cold night,1
2,"They're beautiful on. Love the way they look. Not sure if they're sterling silver, though. I have sensitive ears. Have to wear sterling silver or gold.<br /><br />If I wear them for even an hour,  my ears swell up huge and  very painfully. They're so pretty, I've tried many times with the same results.<br /><br />The studs, at least, can't be sterling silver. Very disappointing.",0
1,Does not fit as expected. Super Loose,0
5,Mi nino está muy feliz le encanto no se lo quiere quitar,1
5,Exactly like the picture very good quality,1
3,I bought the navy dress. To me it looks more black. The material is very soft and comfortable but the look of the dress is definitely not as cute and high quality as the one the model is wear in the picture.,0
1,Took almost 2 months to arrive. Horrible product. Put in for a return as soon as it arrived. Looks like my 8 year old niece made it with her printer and transfer paper. Paid close to $14 total. Company only willing to refund $8 but told me to keep the hat. Yeah I kept it long enough to throw it away. You get what you pay for.,0
1,Runs very very small,0
1,I was looking to some small earrings for my granddaughter but realized the post was too big for the hole in her ear so I used them. Majority of the jewelry I wear daily is 925 stealing silver and have NEVER had a reaction. After wearing the small hoop earring’s with the clear stones for about a week straight I noticed my ears were starting to itch and the more I wore them the more they would itch. Long story short... 925 Sterling silver doesn’t seem to be the metal that they’re using OR the only metal,0
2,The shirt is very thin. Can see through it. Loved the fit and color. But afraid that after one wash would prob have holes,0
1,"Order this if you too, enjoy feeling like a Willy Wonka gang member Oopma Loopa or an exotic potato sack with a bow. Short girls, as you can see, it really enhances your height and flatters your curves like a BIG fluffy storm cloud! After being so excited to receive this, I was even more excited to NEVER wear it in public or anywhere... ever.",0
5,Great quality,1
2,Pants came apart after only several times worn. Jacket still in good condition.,0
3,"I wear size 00 pants and ordered size Medium for a perfect fit. However, the shorts need some lining as I get a camel toe. Also, the wide waistband rolls around in the casing when washed. They are &#34;just okay&#34;.",0
3,Good quality but the shirts were tight for being Lg. Size up if roomy comfort is your thing.,0
3,Top fit true to size bottoms not so much,0
2,"Ok for kids shirt , not the BEST quality",0
5,"I love this scrub cap! Perfect for outside COVID testing as it covers my ears perfectly. It’s comfortable and washes well. I also really like all the patterns that this brand offers, stylish, yet practical.",1
5,Really nice ! I thought it was going to be a bit more stretchy but overall it's fine.  I showed it to my family n thought it was weird....but I like em thanks !,1
3,Shirt was form fitted cut and was 1 to 2 sizes too small. Everything else was great.,0
1,"I was very disappointed made in America but just like any other low cut sock.  They are soft and comfortable but as far as support there is none, at least in my opinion.",0
2,poor quality  - rubbery fish - somewhat small,0
5,"I am a true fan of The Northface Fuzzy Earflap Beanie. It is so warn that I don't need earmuffs. Once I put the beanie on my head, it stays in place and covers my ears perfectly. I have purchased similar beanies that did not stay in place as I did activities such as sledding or running. I definately plan on buying this beanie in other colors. This product is definately worth the price.",1
5,"I bought this bowl because I loved my daughters, but hers just won't sing for me.  I can get it to sing for a few seconds at a time, but I wanted one I could get used to, and practice with a lot.  No practice necessary for this bowl.  As soon as I opened the box and took it out, it started singing.  It will make several different tones at once, the tone is very pretty.  I love this bowl and you can't beat the price.  If you're looking at a great starter bowl, this is the one.",1
4,Feels good on skin,1
5,Great to wear with leggings,1
2,"The bottom fits perfectly, but the top does not.  It's made with a cheap material, this causes my boobs to pop out a lot.... not cool.",0
1,Worn 3-4 evenings a week. Sewing is coming apart in less than 3 months. Very poor quality.,0
1,"En la descripción del producto decia que podia variar un poquito el color, pero es totalmente diferente, no se le ve en nada ese verde jade, es mas como un gris luna, compre esta pulsera para regalarsela a mi suegra que queria algo de jade, pero ni me atrevo a entregarsela porque pasare vergüenza.",0
1,Product doesn’t fit & return process is not simple like most of Amazon.  Seller has many hurdles to jump to get any resolution.<br /><br />You cannot buy with confidence from them.,0
5,"I  ordered these in two colors and  wear them each day. I  have a pair at each door and kick off my  outside shoes as soon as I  get in the door. These are very comfortable and have just enough grip on the bottom that I don't slip and slide on my wood floors. They are holding up well,",1
3,"The embroidered mopar emblem is excellent, the hat material is not. It has a very flimsy cardboard insert that is totally worthless. The hat material is very thin , kind of like wearing a rag on your head. Sad to say this is a licensed Chrysler product. I will not be buying another one, hat that is.",0
1,"It is too clunky, too heavy!",0
1,Really disappointed in the quality of these rings. The finishing is awful and very cheap. Several of the pieces came black and rusty. Just awful. Do not recommend at all! Cheap Chinese made rings. Don't buy this product.,0
4,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order a 10 which fit like my normal size 9.<br />I havent worn them out just yet, but they're super cute!",1
1,It is very thin material and it doesn't really compress at all. I got the size as recommended on the sizing chart based on my measurements.  (I actually got 1 size smaller) and it feels like a normal dry fit tank. I like compression shirts to prevent the nipple chafe from running and this did not work my first run in them.,0
5,"It's very classy looking. I kept one and gave the other to my daughter for Christmas. She loved it, as I do! Also fits well. I am also glad it as a slot for an additional filter.<br />I would recommend this purchase!",1
4,Great fit,1
5,"I love the look of this shirt.  It's a thicker material than I expected, but it holds up well in the washer and dryer.  I ordered a size up to get the over-sized look (like the photo).",1
2,The material is really thin and it is cut out !,0
3,Me gustó el modelo del vestido pero esperaba más calidad de tela,0
1,The collar is extremely fragile and rips easily.,0
5,"My 10 year old absolutely loves this top and she looks so cute in it!  The quality is great, the material is soft and it launders perfectly (despite saying hand wash).  It is her new favorite top!",1
1,It says sterling silver but it changes after a few wear,0
5,Love it,1
3,"Great hat, but putting your logo on it screams I have something in my hat.  It's like wearing a bunch of 5.11 gear that screams I am concealed carrying.",0
3,Eh. Didn’t like the material,0
1,"These are so tight, I cannot get them over my foot.  Let alone on my calf.",0
2,The fit is not great. Constantly slipping off my nose. There's little threads inside that itch my face as well. I've bought some face shields from SA and they fit great. Those are a great deal. These ones I feel like I wasted my money. I bought them and I don't even use them.,0
2,These are not cute little petite earrings. They are large and look heavy on the ears.,0
4,"All for this company and ethics, just needs more reinforcement in the wrapping the ropes. The ropes are nice and thick but the cord they keep them secured with didn’t hold for more than a few uses 💛🙏🏻",1
4,"The color is perfect, just wish the back slouched a little bit more.",1
4,"Yes, I like this scarf. Would give it a 5 but it has gold trim that doesn't show in picture, not too fond of that",1
3,Very soft and really nice tie dyed bright colors 💙,0
5,Dad loved his gift!! Wears it whenever he's cooking on the grill,1
5,Love the colors!,1
1,I ordered the Black/gray sunglasses. What I received had the amber shooter type lens. Returning.,0
2,Beautiful shirt just runs super small. Buy three sizes larger. I had to give mine away to my niece. Sending it back was not even considered since it took almost a month for it to arrive.,0
1,The fit was horrible and unflattering. I got a pair at Old Navy that were a million times better.,0
1,"Poor quality , the seller wouldn’t make a refund and send me return label!<br /><br />I AM STUCK WITH A DRESS I DON’T WANT!",0
1,its a pretty dress but the size is not right i bought a large and its too small i ended up giving i to my daughter who is a size small and she fi into a large,0
5,"I so love this skirt.. I brought it too big, I should have gotten a medium instead of a large and I paired it with shoes that I also ordered from Amazon and received so many compliments.... so much so that I’m going to order another one for a member in my parents church",1
5,Unbelievable quality for this price. Super soft even after washing. LOVE,1
5,I got this watch for my boyfriend an he loves it and he loves me even more so I'm not complaining I love it too now,1
5,I wear a large or extra large I ordered a 2X it fits great and I love it and I got it for a wonderful price thank you Amazon,1
3,cheap made,0
2,The previous Stetson I bought was this size & it fit perfectly.  This one is too small,0
2,"I purchased these as part of a Christmas a gift for mom and the pants have no elasticity, or give in waist. They are too small and company will not allow return or give a refund. They are offering $5 as compensation but I am stuck with the pants! So not happy!",0
2,"for both of us way to huge, we mean huge. beautiful print disappointed they were so big. company refund easily.",0
4,"Cute, decent quality. I bought the red and grey originally in large and decided to order the black too.  Not top quality but worth the price.",1
5,"Love love love this mask!!<br /><br />Excellent quality<br />soft, breathable material<br />colors are gorgeous and vivid<br />adjustable nose piece<br />adjustable ear loops<br />the shape fits very well across the face to minimize gaps like other masks have<br />Love the personalized message from the company on the inside- nice touch!<br />adjustable from elementary school up to a petite adult,<br /><br />would love to see a few more colors added in this small size for kids.",1
5,My daughter loves her new gloves and gives them 2 thumbs up!,1
3,I received a product that was similar but not right. Instead of a white stripe it’s black.  I don’t like the black stripe.  Hope the operations can be fixed for what they ship. the fit is good though.,0
5,"Nice bag! Soft, no chemical odor<br />I'm very happy with it!!",1
5,great bulky belt and very stretchy.,1
5,My son loved it,1
4,They are a little hard to unhook but the sizes are perfect.,1
1,Not as expected very sparkly.  Can't see the gold and silver beads,0
5,"I bought several of these long sleeve tops and I LOVE them! They are so comfortable and warm.  Definitely been looking for this type of long sleeve T-shirt for a long time, never thought I’d find it here, but so glad I did!",1
5,goes with everything,1
1,Inaccurate size chart.,0
5,Pleasantly surprised! Daughter wore for her 2nd birthday was pleasanty pleased!,1
1,"Cute top until I washed it! Cold water, hang dry. Now it's 2 sizes too small!! I never even got to wear it.",0
5,"Good case, looks like it will hold up well.",1
3,"The tie at the top is a bit awkward.  The rest of the dress fit alright, but the neckline made it appear strange.",0
5,"Love this top, fits perfect.  Not to loose, very flattering. I'm 5'4"", and the x-large is a perfect fit.  Will probably order in another color.",1
5,Cool socks - nice quality. The motorcycles may stand out more if you order the blue.,1
5,Great,1
5,super nice and comfy,1
5,My all time favorite shirt!!! So comfy and big. Just the way I like it!,1
5,I love them. Love the colors too.  Fits good too.,1
5,My husband likes the fit and comfort of these pajama shirts.,1
4,"I needed a white mask but sadly it's already sold out, so I purchased a checkered mask. The colors look solid, it fits very well on my large head. The only issue here is that in the picture, the mask would cover the entire area of the neck, but mine covers only half of it. Like, people can see my neck skin while I'm wearing this mask.",1
4,Good variety of charms,1
1,"Too small, but money was refunded.",0
1,Absolutely terrible fabric. So uncomfortable and itchy,0
5,"beautiful, bought this for a friend. Fits great",1
5,Love that it is two piece,1
1,To small and uncomfortable,0
3,Color wasn't what we thought it would be so never tried it on.  Was returned after getting approval to.  Still no refund AND STILL NO REFUND!,0
4,"A nice navy neck tie. It feels fairly substantial, and it is not prone to creasing. This product is made in China.",1
5,"I ordered this in the medium to wear under another bodycon dress as I layer and do not wear bras due to my fibromyalgia.  I am 5'3"" and weigh 160 lbs with an hourglass figure and this dress served very nicely for what I wanted.  Better than some others I have used.  The material helps with the support I have been looking for and it stays put fairly well.",1
5,"I really like these compression socks.  So far I have worn them both for running and for long overnight work shifts when I am on my feet for hours on end.  I’m an amateur runner, so my legs usually start to wear out, but wearing these I noticed that I never really got that jelly-leg feeling.  Instead, I succumbed to my lung capacity first.  They also performed well for the overnight work shifts – I never felt an overwhelming need to sit down and rest my feet.  I don’t know the exact science behind compression gear, but I am beginning to become a believer in it.  I will say this: these are a nightmare to put on, but so are every other socks I’ve ever worn.  They are that way by design because they have to be tight to provide compression.  But once they are on, they provide a constant pressure to your legs and feet.  They have not once felt like they’ve stretched out or loosened on me, and the material feels thick and well-made.",1
5,Exactly like the pictures! I love it!,1
5,"Love it! Lightweight material, comfy fit. Only negative comment is, arrived very wrinkled. Needed ironing.",1
2,"These gloves are very bulky and thick, so even if the touch screen works, good luck targeting your intended buttons. I can hold a flashlight while wearing these, but nothing requiring more dexterity. I also wore these for about 20 minutes in low-30's temps before my fingers actually started hurting from the cold. The warmth doesn't even justify the diminished function.",0
4,very nice for the price.  More like a shawl than a standard scarf.,1
3,Excelent but somewhat large,0
5,Good,1
5,"They both like these very much.  They stay up on face without a 7 and 9 year old having to keep pulling them up.  Good choice, and I would buy again.",1
1,Returned,0
5,"Super cute hat and packs easily without distorting! Fit is perfect, color is great and arrived quickly!",1
5,Miy bonita. A mi hijo le encantó.,1
3,Very disappointed with the sizing.  Dress is super cute and you can't beat the price but would suggest ordering a size or two up from what your normally wear.,0
4,"Very cute and well made, but larger than the picture.",1
5,Nice quality hat.,1
5,Grandson loved it.,1
5,Granddaughter loves it<br />My granddaughter is 5 and is tall for her age.<br />We got a 4 and it fits perfect,1
1,Not worth it - these are such poor quality,0
3,"Cute, but flimsy!",0
1,"It fits fine, but it is not as breathable as my cotton masks. Not buying it again.",0
1,TERRIBLE not a 20g!!!! Huge opened my nose ring hole bigger than it was got infected and yes I cleaned it just terrible don’t like.,0
1,Not much thicker than a t-shirt and sized almost in kids sizes. Really really undersized. ( the 2X I received was about a men's medium in all honesty),0
1,No real shape to this product. The fabric is kind of heavy so it hangs in a weird and unflattering way. I think I wore it once with a cardigan for an Easter thing and haven’t touched it since.,0
3,Very cute watch. However the dial was very difficult to read.,0
5,🖤🖤🖤,1
3,A little shear and bigger in the top.  Very light can easily dress up or make casual.  Good price. Fast shipping .,0
5,This is perfect.  I love it and will order at least one more of them in a different color!  I love it!,1
2,"I really REALLY like how the earrings look, but the clasp is VERY flimsy and barely holds. I’ll probably return them. :(",0
1,Item was to small and requested a return authorization and item returned to Kohl's on 3/10/2020.  Have not received credit....,0

1,so small what's the point,0
5,They are good quality workout pants for an excellent price. I workout regularly with them and they've held up just fine. They fit like a glove especially for me since i have big legs and glutes. It was a good investment.,1
3,Great product just thought it would be made better but my son loves it so that’s all that matters,0
1,The bracelet was received damaged! Returned!,0
2,Cute color,0
1,Was this made for a child?? It surely couldn't have been made for an adult. DO NOT BUY THIS!,0
1,"Look nice,BUT had no idea they for a LARGE HEAD  !!! I need the exact opposite !! need to return",0
5,"Good little case wasn’t super fond of how the necklace was set up, but it’s easily modified (for about 5 bucks at Walmart). Good purchase over all though.",1
1,Very small and came damaged.very poor quality,0
5,My boys really like them,1
5,H.y.f.r. !,1
5,Product just as expected and received very promptly.,1
5,Bought for my daughter and it looks amazing on her,1
3,The material is very shiny. I personally didn’t like that but they cut and fit of the dress was great,0
2,Not as pictured or described. Way too tight doesn't look anything like the picture at all,0
2,"It was a really cute purse but the handles started fraying and falling apart within a month of having it. Too bad, the rest of it is really nice.",0
5,Love it,1
5,excellent all around.,1
2,Dress run too small. need to order a larger size from your usual size in order to fits you.,0
3,"Beautiful necklace, except part of it keeps twisting under so I find myself always having to adjust it.",0
3,"This was beautifully made but I’m only 5 feet tall and a size 10. I’m usually all about the loose and flowy since I have a ton of extra weight to hide, but I thought it was just too much extra fabric on such a short person.",0
2,Bought this to ease neuropathy pain for family member.  The seams are rough and hit right at the most tender spot. Otherwise the quality was acceptable.,0
5,"Cute as pictured. Also nicely packaged. Overall, I am very pleased with the order.",1
1,This dress is all over the place.<br />It's huge and If you don't know Americans sizes don't make them. Period!,0
1,"Way too small. Got a 3x and it fit like a xl, there was holes on the hip area and the treading was coming off.",0
2,Keep sliding off my face.,0
2,"This product was definitely not as sturdy as is should have been. The first time I put it on and reached into the pocket, the seam ripped a couple inches. The price was reasonable, but it's always a disappointment when something fails that quickly.",0
5,I love it! Covers nicely and true to size!,1
5,Excellent quality! Great price! Very pleased with purchase:),1
5,"Fast shipping, good quality product. Daughter really enjoyed.",1
1,If i could give 0 stars i would the item came malfunction the charm was turned inside out tried turning it around and all the things i could but it was placed incorrectly if i were to place it the right way stichiching and everything would be wrong DO NOT BUY!,0
5,Beautiful great purchase beautiful!!,1
1,"I bought a 3XL, but it fit like a medium, or at most a large.  The people I bought it for were very disappointed.",0
5,Very cute.,1
5,Perfect,1
3,Mm esta bien solo que para medir todo tienen que preguntar primero la estatura el color de piel ( por si es correcto que sea de tu color que conbine),0
5,Love this dress.,1
2,The picture is bigger than the earrings you get. Almost need magnifying glass to see. They come in plastic bag in box. Big disappointment. A good price would be ten to fifteen dollars not sixty.  They might have to go back. The more I think about it the more upset I get.,0
1,Not true to size. Fabric is thin. Holes throughout entire dress. DO NOT BUY!!!,0
5,It looks even better in full view,1
5,"This has been the perfect gym bag.<br />Adjustable strap, enough little pockets, great neutral colors, and just enough space to hold gym shoes/clothes and even my small rumble roller.",1
4,"The bottom part fitted perfectly but the upper part on the shoulders they fall off from your arms way down so since it doesn't hold up on its own. I need to be careful not to get exposed. Maybe that was the design, but it just something to look up to, if you don't want to be fidgeting all the time.",1
4,I loved the bad and its constructed well. The only change I would make to the design is for the strap to be made of the same material as the purse instead of the current strap it has. I am a female and I use it often. Enjoy.,1
5,My son loves it!  It fits perfectly!  High quality!,1
5,My daughter loves it!,1
1,Not sure how they missed it. Someone with body odor tried it on and sent it back. disgusting.,0
2,This dress was super cute until I put it on! I'm 4'11 and a bit busty. But not enough busty for this dress! I figured it would hit right at the knee as most dresses do but this came to just about my shins. Was not impressed with the dress overall!,0
5,Locks my earrings in place. I've lost diamond sruds before 😡😥 never again now!,1
4,"These are nice sandals for little girls.  The cherry design is cute and the sandals are good for regular wear with almost any outfit.  They’re not dressy, but they’d look super cute paired with a sundress in summer.",1
3,Hard to attach but once done it is as expected.,0
4,"Super cute swimsuit! The pattern is adorable, looks just like the pic/description. Great coverage for your girls and bottom. I'm wearing a XXL/US 6/8, I'm 5'0 125lbs.",1
5,"I ADORE this bathing suit. I have larger lady bits up top and they held them well (the pads could be a little better/larger, but they're still really effective). I want to get this suit in more colors if they restock my size. This suit is really flattering and doesn't give me the sausage look that certain fabrics of one piece suits do. Love it!",1
4,"love the sweater, and bought a larger size but find it a bit too tight.  Maybe it's me.",1
1,Not comfortable and  made of kind of hard material..,0
3,[[VIDEOID:23e9b71b59aad04c56589058e13d7190]] Not worth the money. The pin at the back of the earing to lock it is made up of poor rubber quality. Looks very untidy and also is not comfortable to wear and remove. The poor rubber quality tears apart after sometime. It would be better if they have given a metal hook rather than the cheap quality rubber. You can clearly see the rubber I have posted a small clip and the picture of it as well.,0
5,"Fit perfectly, wondering if it will shrink in the washer..",1
1,I ordered this top in size XL-got the 1st item with a red XL “sticker” it was too big. Processed return and ordered the L and got the same shirt with a XL “sticker” seems to be a tiny bit smaller but not diff enough to constitute a smaller size. Dont know why these arrived with the label torn out and a red sticker in its place. I guess I will settle for the 2nd one. Dont want to bother with another return.,0
4,They're comfortable but was hoping for a little more padding in the feet bottoms.,1
5,"My husband loves the hat, though wearing glasses while wearing the hat makes the hat too tight (and his breath within the hat fogs his glasses).  He does love it though.",1
5,"They are a creative distressed pair of jeans. Pictures do not lie, and the size is what I was expecting. They have a little stretch to them, so that should help if you get a little chubby.",1
1,Editing review - it is cute. But I just noticed a big rip between the layers of colors. I’m so mad. She hasn’t event worn it yet.,0
2,I wear a 7.5 and got an 8 since they didnt carry my size and was too big. The 7 would have been too small. Nice boot but sizes are not accommodating.,0
5,"Love these earrings, they are delicate, yet make a statement. I get many compliments on them!",1
3,"I actually love the costume.  However it is about 2 sides smaller than what I expected from the size chart.  But, I did like it well enough for the price, that I kept it in hopes of losing weight.  It was beautiful.",0
2,Color is off front the picture. Almost looks like an entirely different tie but the design is the same.,0
4,This is a nice handbag but the only thing is the lining is dark cloth and seems to be cheap.  Very well crafted on the outside of the bag. Very beautiful.,1
1,I am size 8 and purchased an XL. It is too snug to wear. The seams are unfinished. The material is very thin.,0
5,Great product. Quick shipment,1
1,"Sizing, couldn't even try on it was so small.",0
3,"I see a review stating this is a girls shirt... not all shirts are made for the US audience. We here in the US are used to the buttons being on one side, but parts of the rest of the world have the buttons on the opposite side of ours. And there are reasons that go back hundreds of years for it... (just some education)<br /><br />Now to the shirt, it's ok. Runs large and doesn't feel exactly like traditional linen. The blend feels a little different. It's not a bad shirt, but definitely not on the upper scale of quality. It's breathable and great for the summer/hot weather however.",0
1,"Not as expected, arrived damaged.",0
5,Love the sweatshirt. Russell is good quality. The sweatshirt is nice and warm and soft.,1
5,very unfaltering and heavy cheap fabric,1
5,Great buy! I looked and felt great wearing this bikini! It’s perfect for full figure women!,1
4,"Fits well, good material. Very satisfied.",1
1,"[[VIDEOID:d1716934a55f7c21f25a56b84c79972c]] I have ordered one of these keychains before from another seller on amazon and it looked like a real strip of film. It was somewhat translucent and great quality. I ordered this  one from a different seller (this seller) thinking it would be the same but i received it today and it is not at all what i was expecting. I am very disappointed in both the quality and look of this product. Very cheaply made, the photos run out so it is just black and you can see the tape at the end. Also, I inserted a spotify code for the picture by the heart and it is just black, there is nothing there. 2/10 do not recommend.",0
5,Fits soo cute!,1
4,just didn't fit for me,1
3,"So I got my band yesterday.  I am on sure yet, but I think I might like it.  I got to check out  The Apple link bracelet. From what I remember of that band, it really does feel like it.  Being unable to see, I can't personally described what the band looks like. I have been told that it does look OK with my watch, but that the color doesn't quite match up.  Also, I can't even use the band right now  because the tools that came in the packaging to adjust the band, weren't the right tools.  There were also no instructions included with the packaging. My  rating as of right now  reflects  both of these issues.  When I go to a jeweler and get my band adjusted  so I can actually wear it without the watch falling off of my wrist, I will update my review.",0
5,Love the color!,1
2,I BOUGHT THESE AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR A FRIEND WHO ALWAYS WEARS SUSPENDERS. HOWEVER THEY WERE TOO BIG. YOU CAN ADJUST THEM AS BIT IN THE BACK ABOUT 2 INCHES BUT THEY KEPT FALLING OFF HIS SHOULDERS. ARE THESE RETURNABLE?,0
5,Buena,1
1,Small! Not worth it,0
1,Horrible glasses wont stay up and lenses are really big,0
5,My clear bag came in a timely fashion. I use it as a lunch bag it's good and sturdy.,1
5,Nice shirt. Good material.,1
4,"These are really awesome looking shorts. The colors are vibrant red and gold and really pop.<br /><br />They run a bit small though. I am about a size 31 in store bought pants. So I went with size 32 in the shorts and they are a snug fit. These shorts are also SHORT. They will show a lot of thigh, which is fine with me. But if you're looking for a more relaxed or normal fit, go a size bigger than you would normally.<br /><br />I'd give these shorts 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the red ink runs. Beware! Wash them or soak them separately before putting them in the laundry with anything else, especially any white clothes. Washing them on their own caused the white lettering on the crotch area to turn pinkish, so they will never look as great as they did when new.",1
2,"The front of the shirt it too short, like a high low shirt, I like my shirts longer in the front, so it’s personal preference, besides that it’s good",0
5,Always breaking watches at my job but so far Gshock is not showing any signs of wear.,1
5,Best quality soft cotton,1
2,Broke out in a rash after this item came in contact with my skin,0
5,"Feels great, not too thick or too thin. It works great in surgery and I love the velvet sweat band. Fits great over my head and keeps all of my hair in.",1
5,"Perfectly beautiful and the color is just what I wanted. However, its size is more suitable for a child than an adult.",1
5,Beautifully done,1
5,"I love my maxi dresses ! So comfy for around the house, or dress them up for a night out. Thanks!",1
3,"My granddaughter was excited about it, however...I was not happy with the quality. There was a few seems that were snagged and bunched. There were a lot of loose threads as well.",0
4,Good quality fabric but it has a very shallow v neck not like n pic....it is a cotton jersey type fabric.  Also the sleeves have some kind of stitching done toward the bottom of the sleeves that is just weird...idk y it's there. Overall it's a cite shirt but I ordered a size up & it's DEF not long enough to wear alone...its cute with leggings,1
5,I love everything about them,1
5,I got these for my boyfriend and he loves the socks! He stated that he could feel a difference and felt lighter on his feet :).,1
1,The material feels cheap. Sizing is off. I wear a small normally. I ordered a medium and it fits snug,0
3,They're cool for what they are. They seem to bulge out more on my ears but I still like them. Wish they had the rubber part around the circumference to give a more authentic look but I like them and they have fallen apart on me.,0
3,"So I work at Wendy's and decided to buy this watch so I could hopefully rake in more tips by flashing this timepiece. However, most of my customers didn't even know the brand of watch I was wearing, so I didn't get any tips. I ended up donating it to the Salvation Army because it was useless to me. Now I'm saving up for the Rolex Submariner, and maybe I'll leave Wendy's and work at Chick-Fil-A, cause their customers are more upscale. Overall my experience with this watch was very underwhelming. It was reasonably priced but I had to pay $7.99 for shipping, which was unusual because I noticed that other reviews mentioned they paid $4.99. WHAT THE HELL Patek!!! I'm working minimum wage and you raise the price on me for shipping?!?!?",0
2,"For me it was kinda tight around the neck and the chest area was to big, but i also have a very small chest. The quality was really nice and thick just wanst for me",0
3,Nice velvet choker but the total length including the extension is very small. Be sure to measure you neck and compare against total length.,0
3,"Fits true to size. The dress is okay? My daughter looked cute. The quality is not good and it’s  very stiff material. The bunny ears do not stay in place and fall in front of the bunny’s face, so half of the time you can’t tell what’s on the dress. The price point is too high for this quality.<br /><br />I wouldn’t buy this again or recommend it. There are options around the same price that are much better quality.",0
4,Darker than pictured.,1
2,This dress is very classy. But another disappointing experience. It runs too large.,0
1,"Just flat shaped that can’t be fitted to children’s faces properly. No adjustment bids<br /><br />Sent item back, still in progress, since “No access to delivery location”",0
5,It was given to a friend for Christmas. She was in love with the band. Easy to attach to her watch. She put it on as soon as she opened the gift.,1
1,"this product is NOTHING like the picture, the bottoms are the same front and back as in size, and the top, there is nothing there to hold your boobs in. No elastic horrible",0
1,Do not buy these. Terrible quality. They are very dull colors and I attached pictures comparing them to the beautiful bright colored ones I have received in the past. You can see in the pictures how cloudy and dull the resin is. The orange looks more like a dull amber.i was supposed to recieve 126 and I only got 111 so it's also a ripp off. I would suggest going with a different seller.,0
3,"Great for morning cover up, or just after shower.",0
5,Love how they hook on the glasses,1
1,It absolutely sucks that you can buy things prime and then find out they are not eligible for return.  This looks like kids jewelry.  Not good quality.,0
5,"After seeing this dress all over Pinterest and Facebook, I was so excited to see it available on Amazon. I've never had much luck ordering anything I've found on Pinterest :/. The dress arrived on time and is BEAUTIFUL.  The colors are amazing and the quality is on point. I'd defiantly order another dress through Amazon from them.",1
3,love it,0
3,"This was a really good bracelet and it fit well/looked good, but the pearl that holds it together broke off after about 2 months of wearing it. I basically just tied it around my wrist to make it stay on. I would buy it again though, and just be more careful.<br />EDIT bought again and the same thing happened",0
5,I bought this for my 6 month old baby. She is a little big for her age (18.5lbs) and the size 12-18M fits her just right. I love the design and color! It’s like she’s a ball of sunshine whenever she wears this. The fabric of the top is soft. The bottom matches the head band. Didn’t shrink after washing.<br /><br />I’d say this is a cute outfit for little sisters!,1
3,"Top was way big, bottoms fit...had to send it back.",0
5,Exelente<br />Quedaba perfecta,1
1,Nothing like the pic. More like long sleeved t-shirt material. Graphics are subpar.,0
5,"Gave As a gift, the person who receives it loves it!",1
5,Hasn’t taken it off all day,1
5,"I am very picky about clothing but I have had this dress for 2 years now with often use and it has stood up. It is my favorite dress. I rarely leave reviews but I love this dress. I use it for work, parties, galas, and even casual events. I have even fallen asleep in it overnight a couple times. I have  44"" hips, 45"" bust and 42"" waist and am 5'2. I ordered large, it fits perfectly. In the winter/cool fall, Ive even worn it with boots and pants underneath.",1
5,"Amazing style, well made and cute",1
5,I purchased this set for a 6 year old.  The colors are actually brighter than what's shown in the picture and the quality is much better than I expected.  It comes in a nice gift box.  I would definitely recommend this set.,1
5,Love it it's warm and stylish.,1
1,"I took my measurements and read several reviews before ordering this bathing suit. It still didn't fit. The bottoms were a little snug and don't stretch well. I felt like the seams where it's pleated in the front wanted to rip. And the top was too big. I thought maybe it was the length of the piece I. Front between the cups so I altered it. Still didn't fit and after trying on several times but never wearing, it started to fall apart :( I bought this for my honeymoon and it was a waste of money.<br />I'm 5'5&#34; 151#",0
1,"Cheap quality product... the ""plating"" chips just by looking at it. 2 pairs came damaged. 2 pairs were returned. I really wanted to like them, but cheap cheap cheap.",0
5,One of my favorite dresses now. Awesome for my brothers surprise birthday party It stretches and was worth buying,1
3,Color is brown instead of blue. Clearly a dropshipper and not from Foster Grant. Took over a week to arrive. I'll be buying reading glasses in person from now on.,0
1,Have not received the ring yet but I am sure I will like it,0
1,Eh,0
4,"Overall a great dress. It's a soft almost t-shirt like material with soft sleeves. The only downside is that the shoulders constantly slipped. There's no ""fit"" there so they kept sliding. I had to safety pin them to my bra in the back. Other than that, I LOVED it.",1
1,"Didn't meet my  expectation of a designers real leather bag,looks more of an  imitation of leather",0
2,"They are HUGE - they look small (as advertise) - Unless you got a big a$$ head, try to find something smaller.",0
5,Yes,1
4,"Very tiny, but just what I needed as a mom on the go. Can easily fit cell phone, keys, and credit card holder. Only negative is that the strap is not removable.",1
5,it is a a very accurate and silk fit ring.  It is prettier than the picture. Very comfortable to wear.,1
1,Flimsy rubber product rips easily. Poor quality. Rolls up over breasts. I gladly paid to have it shipped back to the company in China. Terrible service.,0
5,Love it,1
4,"I brought these to replace the watch band tail cover for a smart watch I have (Fossil Q). It originally came with a leather loop but working out in it destroyed it. I like these as a replacement a lot, the only drawback I have is the side width. I would have really enjoyed these a little narrower.",1
4,Cute earrings just too small. Sent back.,1
3,"This is my review for Roludom Men's Woodland Wintet Fleece Lined Camouflage Cargo Pant, 40 Yellow Camo. I bought these pants for my husband, who likes to wear this kind of stuff working outside and tramping through the woods.  He has worn them a few times now, and tells me that they are holding up pretty well.  First the negative.  These pants are snug.  After reading other reviews, I decided to buy a size larger.  Good thing I did. At a full size larger than the rest of his pants, these pants are just barely wearable.  He would have preferred an additional size up.  Because they are so tight, he doesn't feel that he has the range of motion that he has in his other similar pants. To the positive, the lining is comfortable, the heavy cotton does a pretty good job at keeping dry, but it is cotton and will have its limits.  Heavy weight material has done a fair job of fending off the briars when walking off the blazed trail.  All in all, he says that they are pretty good, but won't be his first choice, partly because of the sizing and mostly because he prefers his other options, which offer greater range of motion. I was fortunate to receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I always pre-test every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether negative or positive.",0
3,"Be careful; these are rounded laces.  They will slide easily down your kilt hose no matter how tightly you tie them.  Look for squared laces which grip the hose better and don't slide.  Otherwise, they work fine and look nice.",0
2,"The picture looks great, but the necklace in person looks like it might be fake. There is nothing on it to indicate that it is truly a Swarovski crystal. I suspect it is actually glass. It also appears to be from China, which makes me wonder even more if it is a knockoff. It is supposed to be a gift for a family member and I feel like a fraud giving it to her. I don't have time to return it and get something else unfortunately. I am finding that the lightening deals are not always such a real deal after all.",0
1,"It really does his your tummy at a weird spot, as another reviewer mentioned. I bought a small, I'm 5'7'' and 115 lbs, but I just had a baby. Wish the drawstring was just a few inches lower or higher.<br /><br />Edit: After having this dress two months, it has sat in my closet never to be worn. Wish I could return it. The fit is so unflattering!",0
3,Runs very small had to buy 2 sizes bigger than size stated on measurements for my 12 year old competitive swimmer. Nice suit once we figured out right size. Good quality for price. Would buy again.,0
2,"Right shoe had a permanent crease across the top.  Thought I was ordering a different brand, but was unaware that Amazon deceptively places there sponsored products front and center when you search for specific brands.  Ended up with a poor quality product manufactured in China.",0
5,I love it.,1
3,they didnt fit too short,0
5,"Excelente producto, buena calidad y muy cómodo. Envío rápido",1
3,"ReallyGreat gift. She loves it. The only thing is, the chain is a little bit small for supporting the weight of the crystal...",0
5,The recipient really enjoys these.,1
2,I ordered several of these..  2xl and 3xl for my son and nephew<br /><br />They look to be a large or maybe xl.,0
2,"Mixed feelings about product.<br /><br />The first pair we received was unusable.  The inside glove was sewn incorrectly so that 2 fingers on the right hand didn't have anyplace to go.  Amazon was great with the return.<br /><br />The gloves were bought for a 7 1/2-year old who is normal size.  I therefore, purchased the 6-7 size.  They are too big.  There is a good 1/2 inch at the end of the fingers.<br /><br />My 7-year-old son LOVED the gloves, so I was willing to try a second time.<br /><br />The second pair was sewn correctly.<br /><br />I ended up re-ordering the 6-7 size.  The first time I ordered, it was single digit temperatures outside and my son's current gloves had holes in them.  I was looking to immediately replace them, but the stores were already stocking summer stuff.  By the time I re-ordered, the temperatures were in the 40's and 50's.  I decided since he loved them, I'd order with the intent that he could use them next year.  So, I can't speak to how to properly order for size.<br /><br />The other disappointment was that they don't glow-in-the-dark as indicated.  I didn't check the first pair because I was so unhappy that they didn't fit.<br /><br />If I would do it all over again, I would not have let my son see them until I checked them out.  And I would not have bought them.",0
1,Not real Coach glasses the logo is wrong. Do not buy!,0
2,quality cheap,0
4,Nice,1
4,for a gift,1
5,"My wife had bought this for me. I had lost the one I wore a number of years ago. St. Jude is the patron of hopeless causes, impossible dreams.<br />I have worn a St. Jude medal since a child. I truly believe in wearing this medal. I am a believer that what others think are hopeless, I see hope. I am a firm believer that St. Jude is helping me",1
1,Too small and thin material,0
3,Cute but the latches are very weak. One of mine fell out the day after I got them. It’s unfortunate because they are cute but are not secure. I think finding a different pair may be more quality.,0
5,Buen tamaño.,1
2,"Very nice earrings. However, they are very delicate and they break easy. When applying,the back piece broke and I can't use them no longer. The metal is too soft.",0
1,I have no idea what happened. My child has never worn these. Somehow the hinge has come of while in storage. It has warped so it cannot be fixed.,0
5,Worked for me. I can now where a couple of hats that I could not wear for a long time. Foam was a little wide but really works fine.,1
5,"Ilove my Vera Bradley Betsy Bag Purse, I have had many compliments from people and my husband was very pleased with my purchase.  I love the flowers and happy that 10% of the purchase price will go to the Vera Bradley Cancer Foundation for Breast Cancer.",1

1,End tip broke after three uses,0
5,"Loved the fabric!  Loved the fit, and style!  Just beautiful and befitting for the nostalgia!",1
5,"I love this hoodie! It fit perfect and was even a little long which I loved! It’s super soft, but not too thick, yet it’s warm. My only issue was I feel like the head hole was a little small for me. It’s hard for me to fit my head through it, and I wear a size 7 hat size (military size).  If I have a bun, and no way it’s going in easy. But overall I love it and I got a jacket of the same brand and it’s great quality as well! I’ll be investing in more from this brand for sure!",1
5,PRODUCT WAS QUALITY ITEM PURCHASED FOR A FRIEND !!,1
3,"Nice, nice quality but I'm a size four and I bought a size up (small) according to the size chart. It's still too small. I think a large will do better.",0
4,These are nice shoes. But the top is bulky for a person with slim feet.  They are high heels,1
4,"Really like to skirt however, the color is more of a ""winter"" white and would have preferred white.",1
1,It fit but the dress wasn't anything like the photo. The dress draped completely different to be honest it didn't even draped off the arms. It was cut very high in the middle and u could pull the selves off your arm. Looks better in the photo. Didn't like returned. But the dress is a very nice color wished it work.,0
5,Love it! Super quick shippin and great product:) thanks!,1
3,"Runs very small, had to return.  Cute skirt though!",0
2,She has worn them 3x and they are already falling apart. Don't waste your money.,0
1,The rings are much smaller and poorly cut than what it shows in the picture. They truly are for children and are a plain metal cut even though it looks as if there might be stones implanted in the picture. Way overpriced for the quality of the product,0
5,"Loved this robe! Soft and luxurious, well made. It is worth every penny!",1
4,"I bought this for our trip to Austin Texas, and it worked great. It stayed cold& the straps fit nice. Only thing I wish it had a built in straw but it’s great for the price!",1
5,"Cute, smaller than what I hoped but it’s cute",1
5,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend because I hated his last ""murse"" as I call it. I chose this one because it is masculine looking. I am happy to report he loves it. The feature that sold me was the zipper to the main compartment under the main flap.",1
5,"I love unique things that stand out from the mundane or ordinary. The Accessories First Pearl Plaid Scarf definitely fits the unique bill, totally different from anything else out there. The first thing that stands out is obviously the pearls, one wouldn’t really expect pearls on a scarf as most people wrap their scarves around the neck & face, so hard objects built in just wouldn’t be ideal for wrapping near near delicate areas. However, this scarf would make a great snood to show off those pearls when out during events or a night out in the city. New Year’s Eve is coming up in a few months and I will definitely be wearing this scarf to ring in the new year. The pearls are surprisingly very secure, I thought they would be sewed or glued on making them loose or flimsy over time. As you can see from the photo I provided they’re sort of pinned on with a metal base. The quality is good, it’s soft, lightweight & adequately warm. This scarf will make a great addition to your wardrobe if you want to own a unique piece of clothing for days where you feel like adding some stylish flair to your outfit. At the price point of $26, it’s reasonable for a cool scarf, I love my scarf and can’t wait to wear it for the the holidays. I highly recommend it.",1
5,GREAT AUCTION !!!<br />ITEM KEPT ME WARM THIS PAST WINTER !!!!,1
3,"This bag was good for use during vacation - big enough to fit small wallet, phone and sunglasses while fitting loosely across chest for easy and hands free use. My only complaint is the construction - the Velcro patches sewn on to hold the flap shut were sewn on in opposite directions (one was sideways and the other was up and down) so it didn't close properly or hold as securely as I would have liked. Really unfortunate because otherwise this would have been a great product.",0
2,"This is a cute top but not as expected based on the picture. The shape is the same but I was hoping it would be a more solid layer underneath with a floaty, chiffon layer over that. But instead, it's two layers of the same semi-sheer rayon fabric that doesn't breathe.  I tried it on without a bra and omg,yikes too sheer.  I'd need to wear something under it, sadly that defeats the comfort factor, so I'm returning it.",0
4,"Haven’t had this to long and the only discrepancy would be the tassels  fall off every so often , sometimes as a whole clump or just a small piece or 2 , I recommend wrapping a piece of thread around the big knots on the tassels as soon as you get it to prevent them from weakening with use",1
2,"The bottom of the ring is very black, it should be more golden to make it look better",0
2,"I don't like the dress at all. The bust part is awkwardly cut and your armpit part look weird too. I'm 5'4 and 107lbs and the dress fit super bad. I have other dresses from other brands in the same design and they fit beautifully.<br /><br />If I decide to wear it, I'll have to put a layer underneath so the bust and armpit area don't look weird. Bad quality and the print is blurry.",0
4,"I love this tank! Super comfy!!<br />Not quite perfect...<br /><br />I found the back to be significantly longer than the front (more than 4 inches dofference) which was too much for me.  BUT- I sew, I ended up cutting the back about 2"" longer than front and creating a new hem, as well as taking in the bottom 8"" of the sides by tampering .5-1"" at bottom.<br />I love it, had I not been able to alter it, I wouldn't have kept it.  I might just buy another though.",1
3,Fabric is not soft and flowing like it looks. Large fit in the crotch. I returned through Prime.,0
2,"Bag is nice and good size. Shoulder strap is missing, very inconvenient as it doesn't come delivered in a box for easy exchange and they can not send just the strap.",0
5,"pretty cut out design, well made, comfortable & comfort fit. a good value. i like that it is a wide band but light weight.",1
1,"Glasses are not clear.  If you wear them and accept their lower quality, your vision will suffer over the long run.  Back to Amazon they go",0
3,It’s super soft but way way way to big!,0
5,This sexy lingerie is so soft. When I tried it on it was a little snug. I got the XXL. Im about a size 16. I like how it has the open crotch but you can still wear a thong or g string under it if you want to. You can't even tell that it's open crotch unless your laying down. The top part of it is lacy and isn't the scratchy material that some lingerie have to them. The bottom has like a silky feel to it. The straps are thin and has a open back. It so comfortable to wear that I ended up sleeping in it all night. My husband really liked it as well. I don't wear lingerie very much so he was pretty happy when he saw me in this. I'd definitely recommend this sexy lingerie to any woman looking to feel sexy or wanting something that's really comfortable to wear.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.,1
2,It came broken,0
4,"The actual guitar pendent is nice, so I was very happy with that part. The gold chain that comes with it, is very thin and had a few kinks in it, so I ordered a thicker gold chain to replace the thin one that comes with it. Also comes with a bracelet (black thin bracelet), but it was a nice little gift.",1
2,"NOT for a three year old. my son is pretty average size- and these glasses, however CUTE they were, were WAY too big for him!! Had to return.",0
5,Thick!  I slide cancel on grass like butter,1
5,"It can cover the neck and face without being exposed to the sun, it is very soft and light, the fabric feels comfortable, and the effect on the head is also liked. The elasticity is very good, it will not feel tight, the workmanship is very meticulous, the color is very good and it can not only protect the cervical spine when riding, prevent the cold wind from entering after sweating, but also pull it up to the mouth to filter the air.",1
3,one shoe has a short.,0
5,This dress is beautiful. Definitely worth the price! My daughter absolutely loved it.,1
3,When I purchased this item I was unaware it only contained 1 barbell not 2 of them. A little unsatisfied that i now have to wait ANOTHER week and spend $9 on another one.<br />Good quality but wish it was more specific.,0
5,Nice and big it's perfect if you like nice size lanyard beads. Well recommended,1
1,The product was sized too small and way too long,0
1,Plastic bag not completely sealed. No diamond in bag.,0
1,All sizes should have a disclaimer for petite as a standard. I feel like I bought a shirt meant for a toddler.,0
5,lovely,1
1,Runs small.,0
4,Nice belt. Make sure you measure to get the sizing correct.,1
3,"I recently had the opportunity to review the white version of this shirt. I saw several reviews that said order a size up so I did. I ordered the XL when a large may have been what I normally would have ordered. When I received it and tried it on I found that I probably should have ordered two sizes up, it felt like a medium. The shirt has no give and the arms are not all that comfortable although it's hard to tell if that's because of the construction of the fact that it's too small. I'd be willing to give this shirt another try with a bigger size or may just wait until I lose a bit more weight and try it on again.",0
5,"Nice quality, fits perfectly, good quality. Would buy shirt and from bequemer Laden again.",1
2,"In the pictures, theres a bit of a gather around the waist, where the top flows a bit over the waistband.  Nope.  The shorts section is way too long in the rise, and there isnt enough material, lengthwise, on the top portion to have any drape.  It's as though the pockets and drawstring waist just needed to be moved down a few inches.  I had high hope, but this just didnt meet my expectation.  I'll pay more for a better fitting item.",0
1,Mine came without the pins. Completely useless.,0
4,Ok very skinny hardly noticeable. Not really gold color,1
3,Just cut akwardly not sure how to put it.,0
5,great shirt - fits very well!,1
5,Bought for father-in-law. Fits true to size. He gets so many smiles when he wears it!,1
4,They were bigger than I thought but they are nice,1
1,These are extremely poor and cheap quality. They are basically a step up from plastic bags on your feet. No support at all but I guess for the cheap price you get what you pay for.,0
5,Great color. Great bag!,1
2,Falls off the shoulders but tight around the waist. Have to wear something underneath. Would not buy again,0
3,Really thick material. I would not wear these out. They make you look bigger in the butt.  I would not buy again,0
3,The zipper broke first say I put on. It’s great but zipper was not quality.,0
3,"The skirt is beautiful, the material seems to be of great quality, but, the color on some of the stripes are faded.",0
5,Excellent,1
5,"Beautiful dress, love it",1
1,the mask would be perfect if it didnt come cracked. my son wanted to use it for halloween but its cracked and you can tell because the light shines through it. other than that it looks good for the price. i suppose im just gonna have to work with it and tape it for now.,0
5,"So cute, great fit.",1
4,"Cute, flowy and lightweight blouse. Love the “red”, which is actually more of an orange red. I’m usually a size 14 and buy L-XL tops to make sure they fit the 36DDDs and aren’t snug at the hips. Cleavage looks awesome in this blouse. 😉<br /><br />As one of the negative reviews pointed out, yes when tied, the underside white side of<br />blouse shows. This doesn't bother me. As shown in the pic, it will show skin if you lift your arms or thru the tie if tied loosely. I just wear a tank underneath if wearing to work or if the jeans I’m wearing are low on the hips.<br /><br />Ordering another color!",1
2,Appears to be larger on the website but is actually small.  My 13 year old likes it.,0
5,"I wanted to update my black bags....and this big, bold, studded Hobo is definitely the way to go!!  This one is big, so be prepared....but it is very stylish, very well made, and really has the look of a real leather!!  I am a big fan of the single strap...doubles always seem to slip off me.  I love the attention to style it has, and also love the touches of gray, as I don't care for solid black.  This one will really stand out with my fall/winter wardrobe and give it a nice kick!!!!",1
5,"Fit perfectly in on my 22month olds head! And he was super comfy in it, we bought to go with his pilots costume but he wears ot regularly now- and it's warm!",1
3,3x was not the 3x I am accustomed to.,0
3,It's a nice dress for the price. 3x is more like a large size.,0
5,"This was a gift to a friend. He really liked it. At first he said the exchange of lenses was not smooth, but then he said that was a good thing, and it is strong. He did need to adjust the nose pad, but I think that is a good thing, it enables you to customize it a bit. Very comfortable and light. He bikes and really likes it, he now doesn't bike without it. All items in the description arrived, and in good shape.",1
2,"Love the design, but it turned my finger green.  Stainless steel and sterling silver don't do that.  The description needs to be updated.  The inside of the ring is also breaking down after only 3 days of wearing it.",0
5,great product and looks really nice.,1
5,"They werent oversized enough for my taste, so I gave them to my mom; she loves them! They have the vintage look, and sleekness of the cat eye .",1
5,Perfect adjustable size. Sterling silver.,1
1,Not even close to the correct size. Had to return it because there was no way to make it work.,0
5,Love this dress haven't worn it yet but I tried it on. The only problem is the slip is very short so I'll  have my tailor add to it,1
5,"I ordered 2 of the same brand a while ago and I got the chance to try them already and I just loved them, these I haven try yet but Im guessing they are the same. I really recommend them",1
3,"Things I like: the shirring at the waist, cuffed ankle, pockets. Things I do not like: flimsy fabric, inconsistency of sizes across colors.<br /><br />These will do fine lazying around the house, but they do not enough structure to wear out. I also purchased a pair in black which fit slightly differently. The blue ones are tighter around the waist than the black ones of the same size. I’ve come to expect that with inexpensive garments. Insufficient quality control. I’m probably going to end up wearing them as PJs.",0
5,Loved these! Very lightweight and goes with everything!,1
5,"I love this hat so much I ordered two. It is well made, attractive, comfortable and I like the folding feature.",1
5,Very cool workout shirt,1
1,some stones fell out the very first day,0
3,"I'll be returning this because I can't get the dress over my bodacious booty.  I also didn't like the sewing with the sequins.  There were small threads all over the place.  The dress itself was a beautiful color and I just wish I had looked at the pictures of the back to see that it was a lace up, corset-style dress.  I'm afraid if you try to lace it up too tightly the sewn in loops would rip.",0
1,Too small,0
1,"Does not work at all, got another one to replace the one that didn't work and that one also didn't keep the time at all.  Don't buy and waste your money.",0
5,I wear the tie to work and for casual events. It adds that extra detail to your look. For what your paying the Material is fine.,1
1,"Not as pictured. This item is a scam. It’s made of a very cheap, silky feeling material. I am so disappointed.",0
5,This slip is super cute and comfortable. My daughter wanted to wear it by itself without a dress! I bought it a little big so it would be longer.,1
2,"Poor quality, too big",0
5,"The quality of this dress was better than I had expected! It is absolutely beautiful on and flattering to many figure styles. I have a large chest and it had enough stretch to ensure that whether they were smaller or larger that they would fit. The only thing that bothers me is that it is a bit large at the straps and sometimes they slip off my shoulder. However, that is probably because I had to get the larger size due to my bust size.",1
1,I ordered the correct size for myself according to the size chart but it was way too small in the chest by about 6 inches! I had to return it for refund.,0
3,"Good material, but fit was much shorter than expected, making it fit like a sports bra. I still like it, just not exactly like the picture",0
5,I love these shower sandals! perfect if you share a shower with several other people or to take to the gym. Great fit and support!,1
2,"This was hard to get in the bioflex piece. and don't stay very flashy. definitely stays in place, and i dont have to worry about this popping out if it egetsgts caught behind my tooth, but other than that, just not very impressed for what ive spent",0
1,Very wide from the top and shirt from the back..was not made in good material more like cheap material with thread hangings from the sides..,0
2,The shirt was way to small. I ordered a big size and it was very small.,0
3,Ordered a large bur they are so small.,0
3,"The material is thin, the quality just seems a little cheap,  and in my opinion, the black banned area is too high up, but other than that it's alright. If I tore it or damaged it, I wouldn't replace it with the same dress.",0
1,"Broken even BEFORE first use. Disappointed to take out of box (no damage to item or box,) and gently extended the ball retriever and a piece of metal fell out and now the ball retriever was in 2 pieces. IT was USELESS.<br />Asked for refund rather than have it replaced.  Sad I lost my favorite ball I hav ehad for weeks because I could not get my ball from a puddle.",0
2,They don't work for me and I think that they aren't polarized . Oh well live and learn!,0
1,I’m a size 12-14 200lb so I ordered a large.  Babbbbbbyyy!  It’s like a 5x and literally swallows me.  You need to size down several sizes.  I’m going to return it and order a small in both colors.  Will be back to update review with pictures.,0
3,Pretty good for the price. The large leaf has a discoloration on the tip. I didn't notice in the picture until now but it looks like<br />someone messed it up when painting it.,0
5,Great quality and very reasonably priced,1
3,"Pretty comfy.  Not a lot of support, but pretty they work just fine.  I will not be ordering them again.",0
5,"This charm is the awesome, pandora's go for around 40 to 80 a charm and you really cant tell the difference. MY wife loved it and.  A must buy for guys in need for a good holiday or birthday gift highly recommended.",1
5,Fit perfectly. Great pajamas<br /> Fleece is cozy and warm.,1
5,Reasonably priced compression tights.  Sizing chart is critical to get the proper fit.  Very comfortable to wear. Easy to put on (remember they're medical compression tights).,1
3,Too sheer,0
1,Horrible. Not the same product at all!!!!!!,0
4,Product good wish larger size was available,1
5,Functions well especially for fitting in a small travel purse. I like it.,1
2,Quality is good.  But top was small and bottoms were huge for the size I ordered.  Had to return.  They have to get the sizing figured out.,0
3,"The material was a very thin, garden flag type material and it was very baggy. The color was pretty, though.",0
5,Fits perfect following the guide provided!  Only wish the ends of the shoelaces didn't have to be red.  Would look better it the ends were the same as the color of the lace itself.,1
5,These are so adorable and we will keep buying these as he grows!! The grey and black go with everything and the Velcro strap is sooo much easier than battling laces.,1
1,Belt tears apart really fast less than a month it starting shredding,0
5,"Better than I even expected - they fit great, were super comfortable, and really cute!",1
3,The way these go together is very annoying. I make watch bands out of beads and trying to hold this to screw in the tiny screws is pretty difficult. Would not buy again solely on for that reason.,0
1,This showed up broken.,0
3,A lot thinner then i was expecting it to be but most likely my fault for not fully reading the description & measurements of it,0
4,I'm not saying it will make your Gotchya water proof. But i just accidentally put mine through the washer twice and it wouldn't have survived if it wasn't in this silicone holder.,1
1,I didn’t not like these tank tops at all. They were way to small. I had to give this a one star rating but I didn’t want to give it any at all. They don not fit as expected like it was stated. I’m very disappointed,0
4,"I ordered these to use as a fake nose ring. They are too big for that purpose, so I started using them for a fake helix (upper ear) piercing. They work great! They look like a real piercing and the spring-action works great - it helps keep it in place. It also came faster than expected. I was told to expect a week and it came within a few days, which was nice. Worth the purchase.",1
1,They smell and they small do not buy,0
3,"Bad zipper.......,",0
5,"They are great pants, I am 5'3 and they had to bunch up a little bit length wise but only a little bit not much - still wear them and would order again. 😁",1
4,Ok watch wish the light for night time was a little brighter though as I sometimes work late nights and can't carry my phone with me to see the time,1
3,Very thin but cute,0
5,"Great fit, alittle short on length. But overall, great for gym or undershirt for uniforms.",1
5,"I love it, but have not found a suitable occasion to wear it!",1
3,"THis is scarf is really cute and warm. The colors go well together. My only complaint is the &#34;fuzzies&#34; that come off of the scarf. It gets all over the place...my shirts, coats, it even gets in my contacts. I tried to wash it thinking that would help, but it didn't.",0
3,Is ok for allergies or sun covering.,0
5,Looks great on my daughter.,1
3,"Does not look like the picture.  I ordered the appropriate size, but it’s snug - even the shoulder holes.  It’s not cute and drapey like in the picture.  Maybe if you order up 2 or more sizes ...",0
1,"I was looking for green sweatpants for a Poison Ivy costume, my first mistake was in buying women’s sweats and not men’s style.<br /><br />For some reason all women’s clothes are always just legging material (or the dreaded jeggings)<br /><br />I bought 2 sizes up and they were still skin tight. They are really soft and actually have pockets(!) but I will be returning these.",0
1,This wasn’t flattering for my body and looked cheap! I sent it back.,0
5,Love it! East to wear and cute!,1
5,"Very fashionable and cute!! I'm 5'6, 140lbs and small fit me just in case you're wondering about sizing.",1
1,The item I received was not as pictured and the wrong size.,0
1,I’ve had this charm for 9 days and it's already turning.,0
4,Wish the trap can make stronger,1
5,"Fits great, well made, attractive!  Love the pockets and adjustable straps.  Great buy!",1
5,"Just what I need and a good buy, too.",1
2,"Compre esto porque dice que no tiene varilla, lo cual es mentira pero en si, están bien",0
3,"This watch looks great, I love that they have bands for women that fit my small wrist. However, I have had the watch for less than 2 months and already it has died on me. So now I have to decide if I like this watch enough to invest in learning how to replace the battery.",0
4,Husband loves it,1
2,"I bought a size down but it is still way to long, especially for exercising",0
4,Liked the adjustable waist band and the light weight. Material seemed like it  would dry out very fast if wet,1
2,Very cheap material.,0
1,it runs small and shorter than the picture.  It's not really tunic length and can hardly call it &#34;loose&#34;.,0
5,Idk how to recharge it 😰,1
4,"After just  a few, 2 or 3, washings the material started to fade. I use Tide Coldwater detergent and OxiClean colored clothes bleach. Sad because I really fell in love with the material pattern and it feels nice against my skin too.",1
5,My son wears this every day!,1
5,"The color in person is pretty much the same as the color in the photos. We bought this pair, and another, similar, pair that $25.99. They are the exact same thing, the exact same quality and size, making these the better purchase overall. The only minor difference is that the others had been lightly distressed, which is not a big enough difference to me to warrant the price difference. A great buy! Does have a bit of a smell, but it’s the smell of leather and should be expected of any leather product!",1
5,Liked the material and fit. Used for sleeping.,1
5,"Multifunctional key chain, good material, novel style and affordable price",1
2,"Ordered this package last month for Halloween and was extremely disappointed by the sizing. First off I will give props and say that I received all items and that the quality was decent but the sizing is usually smaller than what it shows. I recommend ordering a size up, if your really bulky then possibly two.",0
5,"I really love this tunic! It is soft, comfy, light and covers my behind so I can wear stretchies with it. I got an XL and I normally wear a L/ XL and it fits great. I'd maybe size up if you want it very flowy.",1
1,I wanted over a week to get this item. Was very excited to receive it but when I opened it it was ripping at the seams Very disappointed.,0
5,The perfect favor for my sons wedding. A hit with all the guests. Great quality and pretty as well. We personalized them with thank you tags and they turned out beautiful.,1
5,Bought it as a gift for a teenage girl who’s goal is to play basketball for Duke one day. She absolutely loved it! Fits great and the material was soft and not thick at all. Could easily be worn in the spring time as well.,1
5,I wear a 32D and I bought a large and it fits perfectly. The bottoms are a bit smaller but still I am able to wear them and I wear a size 6 pants. Hope that helps with sizing! Its a great swim suit. I've received a lot of compliments on it.,1
5,looks very nice you could go a size smaller depending on how you like to wear sweaters.,1
1,I loved the look!  I just hate they kept coming apart and that eventually a piece got lost.,0
1,I wore it for less than a week and the stone fell off. =\,0
3,"At 5'11&#34; I have to say that part of the problem is probably me. From the product photo I expected a below the knee skirt, it's above my knee. Not a miniskirt...but not the lovely tea length I was hoping for. It also wrinkles REALLY bad. Out of the bag - creases...Okay...washed it following the care instructions, hung it to dry...wrinkles...pressed it out...once you sit down in it...wrinkles. Cute style, wish I could wear it without the issues.",0
5,Very comfortable for hot weather,1
2,"Some reviewers have had better luck -- quality control seems to be an issue.  The first hat we ordered was not &#34;centered correctly&#34; -- the circle where the weave comes together was about 2&#34; to one side of center on the top of the hat.  We returned that as defective and only received a refund minus shipping, so it isn't the same risk-free shopping experience as one expects with Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Given the positive reviews we ordered a second hat, but it arrived damaged (scratches on the flower and a detached &#34;ring&#34; on one side as shown in picture), possibly due to shipping.  That return was handled to our satisfaction after about a week.  We weren't willing to risk another attempt so we ended up with a different hat from another retailer.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It could be a nice hat, but your mileage may vary.",0
5,Loves them it was a gift,1
3,"Sheer and not flattering unless you are very fit and thin! For the price it is not bad, but keep in mind you will be able to see through some areas",0
4,These are indeed junior sizes. I am 5'11 and usually a size 12/14. I ordered size large and they are very fitted which is what I wanted. They go all they way up to the armpit and are nice and long. The straps are adjustable but a bit thinner than I prefer. They do dig in unless you loosen the straps. Nice soft cotton material.,1
2,"These look oval, but are more rectangular. So they didn't attach and detach easily from my oval frames, and yesterday while trying to remove them the left lens fell out, into oblivion between my car seat and console. On the plus side, after my first order that turned out to be the wrong size (my bad), the seller very nicely refunded half the price without my cost-inefficiently returning them, and sent me the link for these. I will try again, since my preferred brown color is not easy to find in stores.",0
4,Came on time and very soft brushed cotton. Would recommend for the Harley female enthusiast or rider,1
2,"I had to wrestle with the front adjustable tabs just to get the elastic (2&#34; wide) suspender bands free from the inner teeth of the metal adjustment tabs. This ultimately, even after trying NOT to do anything that would scratch the elastic, the tabs were so tightly dug into the place where whatever factory made them, that it was impossible to NOT do some damage to the FRONT (what others see first while one wears these).<br />I would love my money back, but quite frankly, the company owes the public a &#34;buyer beware&#34; in the description more.",0
4,"Pretty good quality, cheap and looks good on my girlfriend.  She really liked it.",1
3,This dress has no shape even though the photo makes it seem like it's flattering. Adds a lot of width to hips.,0
1,Much smaller then the pic. To small!,0
3,"These appear much larger than they actually are.  Perhaps the description gave me the exact size, but I didn't notice it.  Suffice it to say, these could be worn by a child they're so small.  The color is great - I just wish they were bigger.",0
2,Returned.,0
1,"Glasses arrived in an envelope, no case and they were crooked and the nose pieces were jacked up.  Returning them!",0
5,"Cute socks. I wasn't quite sure how they would fit because the sizing was odd, but they fit perfectly. I wear a size 9.""  Not sure why these socks are in the ""toy category"" ??",1
5,Wonderful :-),1
1,I'm returning it i didn't realize it was too thin for my pendant and also it gets tangled very easily.,0
1,Demasiado grande para ser una talla Small,0
2,The design and print on shirt I like but i return this shirt along with others from same manufacture because of the material. The material had a shine or metallic look that I didn’t like.,0
5,Good product for the money,1
4,"Es suave, es tierna y es calida. Pero llego mas pequeño de lo que esperaba, al final de cuentas es marca asiatia",1
2,"[[VIDEOID:db16064767154da5fdba9c495e3e6bf5]] This just wasn’t the material for me.  It wasn’t very soft.  Maybe too much polyester (95%).  Just was too clingy.  I liked the cut out neck, but not the material and fit at all.  I would size up too if ordering.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)",0
2,The straps break easily and the sole seperated from the sandal.  Cheaply made.,0
5,My father loves it,1
5,The product was great! ... more form fitting and quality material!,1
4,very fun graphic socks but the “one size fits all” was quite large,1
5,love them,1
1,Item was delivered with rips by the breast seems.,0
4,"I really like this bra, the only issue is its a little tight around my sides. Everywhere feels comfortable",1
3,"The chain is way too short, and the clasp doesn't work well.  Get a different chain.  Annoying.",0
3,"Kind of cheap looking, but fine for a beach cover up",0
4,"They should get a better zipper for the dress, but outside of that, dress was simply beautiful and completed my figure. I’m normally a size 12 and I had to get a 14",1
5,"Awesome button up maxi skirt. Perfect length for my 5’ 2” frame and heels. Can be dressed up or dressed down. The Downside for people could be that the waist is not elastic, but it’s fine for me.",1
2,"This sweatshirt doesn't have any give and it shrinks.  I am 5'5"", 125 lbs and ordered a medium.  It's too small now and the head hole is really hard to stretch over my head (which is not freakishly large).",0
5,I loved the cream and black stripe dress so much I ordered the black with white stripes as a back up. It's so loose fitting and comfortable. The material is a cotton blend and washes well. The dress does hang off the shoulder a little bit as pictured.,1
1,Almost impossible to open the bracelets with the neaklace and you have to have the necklaces to take off braclet,0
5,Love the bright plaid colors.,1
1,Very cheap looking and the metals are different colors,0
2,Nice mask but too big for my kids.,0
2,"This is a true happy orange!  Bought a small & fits fine.  BUT, please be aware of mismatched stripes!  I took a chance & thought it wouldn't stand out too much, but it is VERY noticeable - the hem line looks crooked & side seams hap hazard - sorta like a homemade mistake!",0
4,Fit perfectly,1
5,"I am starting out in OR soon and found myself needing scrub caps that cover my hair (my old ones left my bun popping out of the back). I ordered these and was concerned at first because they looked HUGE coming out of the package, but they are ADJUSTABLE with a toggle on back- I’m thrilled! The material is very lightweight and it fits comfortably. The buttons are so nice with wearing the mask constantly now post-pandemic. I’m impressed! It holds all my shoulder length, thick hair securely. If you’re wondering if these are worth the buy- YES!",1
2,cheaply made,0
3,"These socks work as one would want them to. However the sock material is a little thin. Not uncomfortable, however if you are used to wearing a thicker sock then your shoes will be a little loose. My husband wears boots and wears a pair of socks. When wearing the compression socks they did great except they were Just too thin to wear with boots",0
5,Love it!,1
2,Neck on the medium is about a snug 16”,0
4,"Love the shirt,  unfortunately I thought it ran a little small",1
5,Super cute necklace!!! Received lots of compliments too!,1
5,just as pictured...had the split sewn up....but fit is great.... dress stretchy lots of compliments,1
5,Love the reversible shoes.,1
3,"I was impressed with shipping method. Dress was perfectly folded, packed inside individual bag. Impressed with dress, well made, beautiful, but large did not fit me. Too small.",0
1,No fué lo que esoeraba,0
5,My daughter had gotten one for me years ago.....(different place) and I thought I'd do this for memory for a dear friend of mine (her parents had died)  It turned out gorgeous!  I love it and its very gifty to give in its velvet box!,1
1,I ordered a xxl and it may be a medium at best,0
5,I love this lounge gown . it came an fits perfect. The fabric is soft an stretchy. I. Would buy it again.,1
3,I like the style of this dress but the material is thick and heavy.,0
4,"They're is always at least one stud base that is broken, but it's a 5 pack for cheap so it never really bothered me. I have a labret and love these for it. So much more comfortable against my gums and teeth than the metal backing. Fits well, sits well, looks great. I also keep the clear place holders for certain functions/school stuff it just when I can't order replacements quite yet. They do break down. Especially because I okay with mine so it's a faster process for me than for those who don't fiddle with them. Again, worth it to me.",1
1,"Total garbage. When the minute hand points to 12, the hour hand points to a spot halfway between two hour markings, and when the hour hand points to an hour, the minute hand points to about :25 after, making the watch pretty much useless. You had *one* job",0
3,Somewhat,0
5,"The day I tried on this light coat , I m in love with it... i was going to go the dark blue, but my daughter suggested that I should try lighter color for the season. I m Glad I did . It looks beautiful on me , and It ‘s light , not heavy ,great for this crazy weather in North Carolina.<br />It s also fits just right as well  , thanks to a  lady ‘ s review , in her review ,she shared her body information ,  it helped me find my right size . So I will share mine as well to help others .",1
1,"You get what you pay for. Lesson learned. Center stones wayyyy off center, some of the smaller stones are missing. Terrible quality, even for costume jewelry.",0
1,"Was going to wear to work, but legs were to tight.",0
4,it's actually real pretty,1
1,Too big for my liking,0
3,"Loved the style but really hard to put on and the bottoms seemed way too smalll, even if the top felt fine.",0
1,"this lenses are overpriced for the end product. I paid extra assuming that the lenses were high quality; but, they are garbage. Less than 4 months in and the coating started to PEEL OFF.",0
3,Cute dress but would not buy again  . Runs super small and it is much different in person than in the picture.,0
5,Excellent value. Very pretty jewelry for the price.,1
2,"Very comfortable, completely opaque, lightweight cloth breathes and flows easily, sleeves are nonrestrictive, scoop-neck isn't as large as shown but instead fits me perfectly. All in all, very comfortable, perfect fit, shipped quickly and delivered promptly.<br /><br />Edit: I ordered more very recently, and they were different. The crystal wasn’t there, and when I contacted the seller they said they’d ship some out with instructions for how to add them to the shirts, but I never got them. One of the shirts I purchased came with what appeared to be a patch of glue covered in animal hair near the hem. The seller offered to let me return it, but ups pickup wasn’t an option so I couldn’t. Overall, quality much reduced, I was disappointed.",0
5,Bought this for my 10 yr old daughter who is petite and it fits perfect. She loves it. Good print. Thin material.,1
5,I would go with one size down. I'm normally an XL but I think a large would've been better. Other than that these are super comfortable.,1
1,The necklace is very cute but is a lot bigger than I anticipated. The chain is cheaply made - the owl pendant keeps falling off as the clasp isn't secure. The gap is big enough that it keeps falling off - waste of money...,0
3,"These are really great pajamas or loungewear. Wherever they came from the person that package them oh, the second pair was damp and moldy. This may not be the sellers fault it may be at the Distribution Center. I return the second pair that came in the two pair I ordered package.",0
3,"These are very nice quality Shemaghs and the material is very light. However, they are definitely not 100% cotton. My burn test melted the fibers into little black balls. I just ordered a couple more and I am debating trying to get a refund due to the false advertising.",0
2,It looks nice but certainly not a baby bag.,0
2,"I bought this hoping it would be a flattering bikini after having twins. I sized up (normally a 0/2 or S in suits, but purchased M) and it fit, but I did not find it flattering. I am long waisted, and after having the babies, have a little belly from diastasis recti. I found this to hit me in all the wrong places.",0
1,Super thin  horrible quality,0
5,Love them!!,1
5,"I have one in almost every color!!  Great for leggings!  Cute, affordable and washes nicely.",1
4,I'm going to sew/taper the bottom corners because I don't like square bottoms. Its fits so cute that I don't mind doing that quick work. So cute!,1
1,These sunglasses broke after my son wore them one day,0
5,Look great,1
5,"My mom is a huge Tom Selleck fan (which I am sure is not a unique sentence) and I am always on the hunt for gifts that she'll like or make her laugh. The quality of this mask was pristine and big, which was perfect as I surprised her with it on her birthday. It went along nicely with a Magnum PI hat I got for her too. Thank you!",1
4,"Wore to a casual cocktail party.  Did the job, but was a bit too big on me.  Was better than being too small, so gets 4 stars",1
4,Fare quality,1
5,I get compliments on this shirt every time I wear it.  It's more subtle than something that is all leopard print.  Tempted to buy a second one for whenever I wear this one out.,1
2,way bigger than it looks,0
5,Genuine leather well constructed and works really good.,1
5,"Good quality, sharp design!",1
1,Not sure why but it irritated and caused my piercing to get infected.,0
5,I had to shipped this for my son in New York because they get so much snow out there and he loves it! Thank you!,1
2,These fit a little on the small side and are made with poor quality materials.  Mine ripped playing volleyball.,0
1,I did.Not what it look lie,0
4,"I bought these for my family for our flights to London & Paris in a few months. We've already tried them out just hanging out on the couch and they are quite nice. We'll probably look like fools on the plane, but at least we'll be comfortable. I didn't notice any odd smell that other reviewers mentioned and the hood helps block out noise if you're trying to sleep. For me the only negative is the fact that you have to carry them when you're done... they don't deflate, so you can't just throw it in your purse.",1
2,"I waited 3 weeks for these booties and was really disappointed upon receipt. The booties are very, VERY long. Yes, LONG. Long and extremely pointy. Pointy to the point of being ridiculous. The red is a true RED RED RED but the shiny overlay makes them look cheap. They look almost plastic. These had to go back. I'm a true 6.5 but by reviews I ordered a size 6. Still WAY too long.",0
1,[[VIDEOID:2a51428c395f1122862338240a999993]] I am no happy when I open my package. The plastic bag were it’s come in was broken and the earring was not stuck to the pin. Is no fair pay for something that you need to fix it,0
2,I don't like it though. It is to busy,0
1,"Smells like trash, and the size doesn’t fit like a XL, more like a medium I’m very upset!!!!! Will NEVER buy from them again!!!!",0
3,Beautiful color but I ordered a large hoping for a generous fit on my medium hand.  I could barely get them on.  But they are nice enough enough that I’m going to return these and order the XXLarge.  Here’s hoping….,0
1,"These cages are not worth the money. I bought them for pearls and the seashell is too small to fit a pearl in, there are 5 that I can’t get a necklace through. If you are using these for pearls do not waste your time. Some don’t close well either. Just bad all around. I will be returning.",0
5,Comfortable shoes for hiking!,1
5,I get so many compliments on these jeans!!,1
5,Love this blanket.  It is soft and not to heavy.,1
1,Band sucks too hard to close and open,0
2,It was cute but way too big. Order a size down (not something I’ve ever recommended before). I’m also petite so the straps wouldn’t stay on and I had to return it. If I went 2 sizes smaller it might have worked. It definitely covered my stomach nicely though.,0
5,Llegó hoy 15 junio 2022,1
1,"Looks like a nice hat, but way too small. I'll see if my Grandson wants it",0
5,Perfect summer dress,1
1,Absolutely disappointed! Came in a tiny box all squished. My daughter is super upset. Returning and getting something different. Don’t waste your money.,0
5,"93! I was lucky enough to find this great artist and acquire this amazing shirt! The photo does not do it justice! When you get the shirt, what will surprise you is the thickness of the print. Most prints are thin and cheap. However, this is so thick (and warm) that it shows no sign of tearing and is very durable. Also, the shirt isn't some cheap, mass-produced zero-quality fabric. It too is very durable and offers flexibility and ease of movement. Perfect shirt for lounging around in, or going out on the town!<br /><br />The service was amazing and Michael is a great guy. When I had a problem with the shirt (my broad shoulders and long torso), he sent me a larger size, post haste! I would strongly recommend any and all occultists to support this man in his work! We need this guy to stick around!<br /><br />Thank you again Mr. Shaffer! 93/93!",1
4,Very pretty dress. Some little strings hanging off and fit a little large.,1
3,Loved the sandal but made for a good medium to wide foot/ankle.  I walked right out of them.,0
5,These laces are really simple to install if you pay close attention to what you are doing.  Go to the web site and follow the humorous directions.  Once they're on your shoes enjoy never having to worry about laces coming untied or getting loose.,1
5,Perfect. Color matches picture on the website exactly. Soft and good quality. I love it.,1
1,I have had these slippers for less than 2 months and they are falling apart. The outer material stretched and is slippery and uncomfortable under the foot. I have never had a shoe wear out to one side before and every time I take a step I feel like I’m sliding off of it.,0
1,"Complete waste of money, don’t waste your time. I almost Lost a 700$ watch today Bc the band broke in half",0
5,Love the look of this bag! Very chic and very spacious! I bought it because I'll be traveling around for 6 months and it fits everything I need.,1
1,Defective - Straps were sewn in the wrong place and were sewn backwards.  Dress fit terribly and the cut was way off.  Don't waste your time and money on this!  Returning.,0
4,Absolutely like the style of these glasses. If they came in Polarized lens i would buy all of the styles.<br />Fit well - color is nice,1
5,the look,1
3,"Tight fit, otherwise cute",0
4,If you are a large better get a 2x. But really cute,1
2,This dress doesn't look quite like what the picture advertises.  The sizing is small and the waist is much higher than the picture leads you to believe.  The dress seemed to be made a good quality.,0
5,I love this bag! It is perfect to pack your towels and beach/pool essentials and lunch or drinks on the bottom. Highly recommend!,1
1,Pretty sure I ordered the clear color set and what I got was an assortment of colors. Not cool,0
5,The guys loved it as there wedding favor,1
1,I have tiny wrists. Finding a band to fit is a pain. Makes it even harder when the product info is not correct. This doesn’t go as tight as advertised. Maybe 5.6-5.7,0
2,"Very thin, looks very different in person compared to the picture. Looks like it will not withstand one washing !! Not pleased at all.",0
5,Excellent product,1
3,"Es demasiado grande pedí una talla ""S"" y parece ser ""L"" el material es bueno",0
3,bought these for my son.  He liked them very well.  Nice size. Comfortable.,0
4,Me gusto,1
1,Not adjustable poor fit,0
3,It’s a little bit too small,0
5,"Omgoodness, these earrings are legit!! I ordered them because they reminded me of the Nefertiti earrings from the 90s, and I'm so glad I have them!",1
5,Bought this for my wife for a wedding. She loved it classy and looks great.,1
5,Sizing is off. We reordered a smaller size and my daughter loves them.,1
5,Loving my new earrings.  Go Tigers!,1
5,love it!!!,1
5,"Really cute bracelet, super quick shipping, very pleased. Highly recommend, A+",1
2,This dress is absolutely beautiful. It was just too short. ):,0
4,Good shoes to walk with.,1
5,I have pretty much all styles of the csb sierra crop and the quality is practically the same! Sooo soft and comfyy and tbh i think it is better. It hold the girls in a bit better,1
5,Very cute.,1
5,Fits nicely on my bracelet.,1
5,"LOVE this dress! I bought it last minute for a wedding and it was perfect. So soft and comfortable to wear for a long period. It's a regular maxi with pockets, but the ruffles on the sleeves make it seem way fancier than it is. So cute!<br /><br />I'm 5'4 and 150lbs and it fit perfectly! So flattering and doesn't highlight a tummy. It was slightly long, it grazed the top of my feet, but was enough that I didn't need to hem it. I just held it up as needed and it worked great.<br /><br />I love this dress so much and can't wait to wear this other places!!",1
5,"Beautiful toe ring, very Comfortable ...",1
5,"This was my first pair of biking shorts. It was hard to choose between a small and medium.  I usually wear a size 6 pants but have ""grandma"" thighs and didn't want the shorts too tight.  I ordered the medium.  They are snug but not so tight that they bulge the ""thigh meat"". I'm pleased. The padding makes biking more comfortable but I have to admit that they feel strange when walking...maybe I'm just not used to them yet?!",1
3,Gave one to goodwill. Kept the other as trinket.,0
3,wore them twice and one of them broke.,0
2,Inaccurate sizing,0
3,"I planned to use these shorts as a more modest bottom of 2-piece swim suits. Crotch skin is sensitive so protection is important. I was planning to wear a separate nylon panty under these shorts and accept panty lines showing. Or wear these shorts over a tank suit. But then I saw on Amazon a different pair of shorts, made of similar material, same style, comparable price, but those other shorts have an attached panty lining that shields the crotch from the 4 intersecting seams. Now that I have the other shorts that have a built-in panty, these shorts whose 4 seams are not covered will become back-up only. Oh and the X-Large size fits me well eventhough I usually wear US size 10 or medium clothes.",0
5,We are on our second pair. My granddaughter cannot get enough of Minnie! She love loves her slippers!,1
5,"OMG i love it. This is a perfect fall/winter top to throw on with some leggins & UGGS or some boots , you could even pull this off as a cute high-lo dress ! Its really cute! But if you have some muffin top it will probably accentuate that problem area (i am speaking from experience) But i still love it. I am a 34DD/36D-29waist-38 hip and i love the fit of this top.  I would recommend this top",1
4,Nice,1
2,"This is great because it's made from cotton. However, it is made way to small. The bottom of my breasts were out of bra. The shoulder to breast area was way to short. Might fit a young girl of 12 but not an adult.",0
5,"I own two of these and will likely buy a third. I always get compliments when I wear them. The shape is SO flattering, and it's fun to wear--especially with a crinoline on special occasions!<br /><br />I like that I can just throw it in the washing machine. And you can't beat the price. What are you waiting for?",1
5,This is the most comfortable bra I have had on since my surgery and a bit of shape is built in!  Buying more.,1
2,Pretty but chain broke with first use.,0
2,[[VIDEOID:a352c614c63d4fb2d6e58fa943d8d9a1]] Product arrived and seems soft and comfy however see video… as I tried to remove the wax paper it melted to the vinyl (?)<br />Ruining the shirt,0
5,My daughter loves this colorful dinosaur dress. It fits true to size. It's fairly lightweight and is great for spring and summer.,1
3,Item looks way better online that it does once delivered... Tends to look a bit cheap,0
3,"The material is not thick like the photo and the collar doesn’t stand up. I guess for $36, it’s okay. 5xl fits us size 16.",0
5,These are great!  I wear them everywhere.  LOVE them,1
1,I was excited to get this product and then when it arrived I put it on my face and it fell off. It's oversized and I have an average size face for a 49 year old woman.,0
4,"Was a very pretty dress, but was not for me. I had to send it back and get a bigger size, then return again as it was still a little tight in the arms (mine are not very big) but it just wasn't comfortable and it felt a little matronly. The service was awesome though and they were great about the returns. I would try them again if the occasion arises!",1
5,Its well made<br />However it does not iluminate at night<br />As described<br />So I returned item!<br />I would of keeped it otherwise!,1
2,"Other socks ordered fit fine but your owl socks were too small, unfortunately. They were listed like the dog and others that fit fine",0
4,Great tie,1
5,My first charms and they are very cute and look just like the picture. I would definitely recommend.,1
3,i don't like the material,0
5,I love this dress!  I ordered the purple for a banquet & got so many compliments!  I’m a size 12 & 5’9” & the large fits perfect.  The material is thick & not flimsy.  Very pleased with this purchase that I ordered in 3 colors. You won’t be disappointed!,1
4,"I really like this hoodie. It runs big thou and it doesn’t have pockets in the front but, it’s super cute.",1
3,I like them I just feel they’re a bit overpriced to be honest,0
5,"Very cute child shirt. My son was,super excited. He loved the shirt! It was true to fit.",1
5,"[[VIDEOID:571a2650978748ae672d54ad2f09cb80]] Wow! I was skeptical about this pair, it looked comfy but I wasn’t sure. I tried them when they arrived and they’re super comfortable! Beyond my expectations. I’m a regular 7.5 and I had to order size 7 because they don’t have half’s available but I would say it fit. I’d like to have some more room but I think 8 would’ve been way too big. Over all I’m satisfied with the fitting of these sandals. Love that it came in a little bag",1
5,Feels soft nice fit haven’t washed yet let’s hope it holds up,1
4,"Love the look if it were true to size. I ordered by the chart and it is a little tight and they don't offer an XXL. Weight of fabric is good, color is true, design is nice, just runs a bit small.",1
5,"Fit's great and very light weight. It's a beautiful wine red color. This will get lots of use, my wife loves it!",1
3,"Ripped  an ear a bit after one use.  Was easy to see back together, but a bit disappointing.",0
5,Love this!!!,1
5,love the styles and  how unique each pair was.  great price.,1
5,Awesome handbag the birds are very pretty and is a good size you can fit everything in it.,1
4,The dress fits perfect it's a jersey material I bought Medium and I am 5 9&#34; weighs over 180lbs,1
1,The zipper no longer runs straight after he first run through the washer and dryer.,0
1,"Fabric is too thin to actually be used as a compression garment. Itis also made of a mix of materials that is itchy if worn for more than 3 hours. ""seller"" also contacted me after review of their service to ask for my shipping/mailing info to send me more stuff. I mean they had the info when they mailed the original order, so why do they want my info through an email? Sketchy",0
5,Very good comfy washable. Used when excersing... feel protected.,1
5,"Cute little heifer key chain. Bought it for a gift, she loved it. We’ll made and sturdy.",1
5,These seem well made. I like the material. They fit well. I will have to provide an update later on how effective they are against leaks. But overall I would recommend.,1
5,Just enough sparkle!,1
1,too small for an adult or teen to wear?!?!?,0
5,My GF really likes this wrist strap for her Apple Watch 4 gen. It’s easy to use and to adjust.,1
5,Perfect for travel. Folds to a small package. Fits as expected.,1
1,Shipping took too long. Bought this for my fiancé for our wedding day. Way too small. Also showed up with blue and black pen ink. The color in the picture of the shirt looks white but the shirt is actually ivory. Not happy with my purchase.,0
1,"So, so very small!  For a child maybe?",0
5,"These shirts are good quality with a cute design. The price is great for a three pack. These do run a tad small, so if your child is in between sizes (or close to), I would recommend ordering a size up.",1
4,"Like how it fits, had to roll up the sleeves because they're big/hang lower than I personally like. This particular set is true to size.",1
1,Mittens arrived broken! Heating cables are completely broken off and detached from heat packs!! No warm hands here!!!,0
1,Extremely hard to put on and broke.,0
5,Great Bag!,1
1,I return this<br />Becoz of the wrong size,0
2,Purchased this garment for a casual beach wedding. It was was not as long as pictured. I was very disappointed with the length.,0
4,"It's not tiny, but the small is a little smaller than what I expected.  It still fit.  Delivery took longer than the rest of the random items I ordered.",1
1,Bought this for my mother and she was so upset the material was not to our expectations very thin almost like a cheap garbage bag.,0
3,Runs small I ordered a size small and it feels like an extra small. But great quality very cute,0
5,Very nice! Thank You!,1
5,"Love,love, love this sweatshirt. Fits perfect and bought another one.",1
1,Do not buy this. It is small and looks cheap,0
2,"[[VIDEOID:1c864629c7f980f6d422bad2576dcfff]] Very cute sweetheart, size was surprisingly correct. However, after wearing it, the vinyl is peeling up. I am so tired of amazon allowing these junk companies to sell their misleading, garbage products. I guess i have a false sense of security when I shop on amazon. I did not think that they would allow sellers who sell poor quality items. I am super disappointed. Amd now I'll have to fight for a refund, because unfortunately, this was not a cheap sweatshirt.",0
2,"It’s child size, was looking to replace my old watch with something different but it’s so small",0
5,"I love the room in this bag, the pockets are great, the strap is wide and well made. I also love the feel and the look. This bag is a keeper.",1
4,This shoe is amazing. I have arthritis in my feet and walking in most shoes is painful but these are amazing. I would say they run just a little big. They will be perfect for around the house but maybe not for a lot of walking because my foot occasionally comes out. I don’t think it’s enough of a difference to size down though. I went ahead and bought another pair that have the full back and I love them,1
3,I absolutely love the body chain however it broke day 1 after trying it on...Boy does that suck,0
5,Excellent,1
1,Although; this cap is COMFORTABLE; SOFT DENIM AND NICE BLUE JEAN COLOR;<br />  it neeto add a  EXPANSION STRAP WITH SNAPS TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE. It is a little tight for my taste.  Unfortunately; it may Shrink More in the laundry. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.!<br /><br />BUY AGAIN?? MAYBE,0
2,These do not help at night but does minimally decrease the glare on on coming vehicles.  The glasses are also painful to wear.<br />Don't spend your money.,0
1,I tried this dress on after receiving it and didn't like it. The material I don't like.,0
2,It was cute but much much smaller than expected It's kind of Amazons thing at this point,0
1,"The bra itself is nice but the size is way too small. I purchased a 40D in pink. In the picture, I put another one of my bras (also 40D) next to it. You can see the difference. Not even sure what band size this might be to let others know how to purchase. Will have to return the product unfortunately.",0
1,Very cheap material,0
1,"cheaply made, low quality masks. do not waste your money.",0
3,In my opinion these are not true spandex....they are made out of very cheep material.,0
2,Really liked this lanyard until it started turning my neck green.,0
2,"The dress is longer than pictured and didn't have any structure to it. It was like wearing a bag, even with the belt on.",0
5,Really soft velour like material,1
5,Great sweatshirt.,1
3,I love most everything EXCEPT the neckline.  I feel it pressing upon my neck and I don’t like that compressed windpipe feeling.  Otherwise incredible product.,0
4,"i love this skirt, I think it fit perfectly. The only downfall (and maybe it’s because of the color I chose) is it’s see through. I got the baby blue color.",1
3,"So beautiful,  only very disappointed pq it took so long to arrive!!",0
1,This outfit is ok,0
5,This makes putting pads backing swim wear & tanks so much easier... how did I function before,1
2,The sizes are way off!!! Xxxl doesn't fit a bigger chested lady who wears an xl shirt,0
5,Gifts for family,1
4,"Good quality; zippered with key ring and side snap pouch.  For my taste, a bit large for carrying in my pocket, especially when full of coins.",1
1,I purchased this watch for a birthday present . I received  the Watch on September 3 it’s now September 29  not even a month . The watch has stopped working.  The time  would always keep on switching it would never stays the way you set it .  I’m so disappointed and honestly a bit embarrassed especially since it was a gift for someone.,0
5,The sweater fits great. It was able to wash with no issues. Nice texture and the only issues was one loose thread it the neck of the sweater,1
5,"Very nice strap. Like all iWatch straps, easy to put on and take off.<br />The ""velcro"" that keeps this together is not the traditional loop and hook, but a much nicer product that works the same way. Very impressed!<br /><br />Very happy with this!",1
1,Terrible quality. My handle straps broke within a month.,0
2,"Great bra, but it feel apart",0
1,Awkward fit. Cheaply made.,0
3,I purchased another brand and it was too big so I wanted to order again a sized down but my colors weren't available so I got this instead and ordered a sized down and it was too small.,0
1,Trim is falling off of skirt I just opened it never even worn,0

5,I love this watch! they make great gifts for that special person in your life! I get compliments on it every time I wear it! the wood does not fade and the stainless steel is still shining like new! Original Grain makes a fantastic product!,1
5,I’m a super curvy girl so I was kind of worried about this item making me look bigger than I am but I needed some comfy clothes for this summer so I decided to try it out. This jumper hugs me I’m all the right places and is loose where you want it to be! I’ll be buying more colors soon.,1
5,nice,1
1,Broke after an hour of wearing sent back,0
5,"Even though it has a long shipping date, waited and got it. Affordable and the quality is nice for it's price. My wife liked it so much.  Will buy again.",1
5,Cool,1
5,"I love these bags. They work for just about anything you need to tote around with you. I've used for a gym bag, lunch bag, beach bag and overnight bag! Multi-purpose and you can't beat the price!",1
3,"The quality of the hat is good, suitable for children. That is, the adhesiveness of the removable transparent cover is very bad, and it is not sticky after a few times of use. I am disappointed.",0
2,Shirt is see through on the sides.  One of the straps is sewn awkwardly. Meaning it is half the size of the other strap. Super itchy and rough.  you can chance it if you want but i wouldn't if i were you.,0
5,Nice for simple dress days when you need just a little bit of colour on your earlobes.,1
1,"It didn’t arrive on time initially. When it was received it smelled odd. After I washed it several times, it didn’t fit well and I was unimpressed with the entire experience. Wouldn’t recommend.",0
3,They are nice but do not look like the picture posted. It’s hard to tell if it’s a heart. And you see more of the silver piece that holds it together then the stone.,0
5,TGEY ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ❤️🥰,1
1,"This is a legitimately cheap and poorly designed product. It is difficult to get your cards in and out of this wallet. I have been using it for 2 weeks thinking there was some sort of learning curve, but no. This is bad design and stay away if you are someone who values efficiency. Frustrating to use and it's embarrassing fumbling to get a card out every time you need something in there.",0
2,I didn’t really like the fit of this blouse because it was too tight fitting across the chest area,0
1,"This was made with extremely low quality fabric.  It was also WAY too small.  I ordered an XL, but it fit more like a Medium.  Would NOT recommend this product.",0
5,Sturdy cap.  Adjustable fit.  Just what the doctor ordered.,1
5,LOVE THEM!!!!,1
5,"These tags arrived quickly, and are a great value for the price.  The colors are vivid and the material is study.  These are well made and will last a long time.",1
3,Get the size down from what u usually get. It was too lose for me. I got an xl which is the size I wear. I shoulda got a large. No matter how much I tightened the straps i still had loose sides at the under arms. It was cute. I liked it. Just didnt fit.right.,0
5,Good,1
3,"Runs small, shrunk, and very very thin T-shirt material. It’s a women’s XL and I gave it to my 9 year old to wear.",0
3,Material is very lightweight. It was a little odd not high quality and small. Definitely size up if ordering. Gifted item instead.,0
5,I really love the Crystal I have a lot of Crystal s but not on a chain.,1
2,"The outfit is okay. The decor on the sleeves was falling off when I pulled it out of the bag so they are definitely not stitching these properly.  What I couldn't see in the pictures is all the pleats coming off the waist down in the front which literally made me look 8 months pregnant lol  The pattern is nice fitting, arms, legs, sleeves is to size. Fabric is average quality.  I would have given 4 stars if the stitching wasn't looser than a stripped screw in a double hole.",0
1,Too see through,0
3,Very nice but chain broke,0
1,"Made in china, too small, and too short.",0
3,Heart came off after 3days and after that it feel apart,0
5,This shirt looks exactly like the pic and is very pretty.  You can wear with leggings or jeans.,1
1,Poor qualiy,0
2,Gave it away as it was to small for me.  Also could've returned but it would have cost more than the dress to ship it back!,0
5,Nice hat for warm days and it would be perfect if it would also improve my golf game.,1
1,Dress was completely different than picture online,0
1,"Lo usé 2 veces y el tejido ya empieza a lucir gastado. La pretina inferior, que entalla la cintura, ya se aflojó. Al borde de la cremallera tenía hilos sueltos. Es de pésima calidad!",0
1,"Don't buy. Very poorly made. Gave it to my hubs for x-mass, broke today.",0
4,Very nice and comfortable. Almost slimming. Sleeves are just long enough. Not baggy like sweater sleeves often are,1
5,"I am a tulip l over and this is beautiful, I am going to love it.",1
5,Got this dress for my mom and oh my gosh the colors are so beautiful!! Looks much better than the picture. So vivid. The material is stretchy the color I got is not see through and it looked amazing on her and fit just right. I’m really happy that she liked it.,1
2,This doesn't sit properly.. keeps popping up.,0
5,Awesome as always Lucky 13.,1
5,Wonderful piece and great worksmanship.,1
5,I really love these earrings.  I also have them in gold and silver!,1
5,Love these shoes!!!,1
4,"Lightweight yet warm, comfortable and a nice color. Was a present from the spouse, so it's quite welcome.",1
1,Very short,0
5,My daughter likes them. She said they are very comfortable.,1
1,Flimsy and if there is a little wind they fly off.,0
1,"Typically we purchase shoes in a store for my 9 year old son, however we couldn’t find his size- and these are these he wanted.  So we bought them here.  Day 3 of wearing them they started coming apart.",0
5,"This is a beautiful dress, and so nice for the price",1
4,"I'm breastfeeding my four kid and this bra doesn't seem to keep my breasts in when I am full, I'm a 34D",1
3,"I brought a 2x the pants fit perfectly ,the jacket was a no no ,it was small enough to fit my 10 year old niece",0
4,"This is a fun version of a cowboy hat that's shiny, sparkly, multi-colored, lightweight and comes in exactly one size with no means of adjustment. So if it's too large or small, too sad! If you wear it anyway, it's light weight will allow it to fall or fly off. Keep it for use in limited situations and stay out of the wind!! It looks amazing though...",1
1,Dislike,0
5,Cute,1
4,"It's a wonderful looking time piece, but the quality of craftsmanship is lacking a bit. Got one as a gift for my friend Christmas '13. Had to get him another one Christmas '14 after a young relative of his overwound it and broke the movement. It's cheap enough  to replace on a whim, and it is a beautiful LOOKING, functional watch. He and I are especially fond of the magnifier cover.",1
5,Great.  Runs true to size.,1
4,My teen and tween children loved this gift.  My only suggestion would be to have a slit in the inside of the hat to remove the cords to wash.,1
1,Horrible. It blew out one of my ears trying to get it in. Do not buy these ever! So much blood...,0
5,It’s a lovely little tote! It fits so many things inside it. Great for my weekend travels😍,1
5,Love the dress! True to size.,1
3,is fit but the model is not the same we saw in the picture,0
5,I love it,1
1,"It came broken! Otherwise it would have been a great mask. They shipped it in a regular yellow envelope! You’d think with all these people complaining about the masks being broken that they ship it in a small box. Very disappointed, as we needed the mask for a party tomorrow.",0
3,"The canopy is impressive, fabric will last but the frame is badly designed.  My husband said it wouldn't last and he was right.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and the price was low so I said if it lasts one season we would get a new one next year.  Well, it didn't make it through the summer. Couldn't stand up to even the slightest wind.  And no, this wasn't from a big blow.  Seller made it good with a full refund. They get three stars for customer service even though I was supposed to get a free canopy and never did.",0
2,"Poor quality, terrible dye job x extremely dull color, plus it has a odd smell. I recommend you buy from a different seller, waste of money.",0
1,"I don't like writing negative reviews, especially since I know they can influence peoples decision to purchase, but I cannot recommend this shirt. I love the cream color of the shirt, and the image itself. But The shirt is very uncomfortable (feels rough and stiff) and the graphic itself dissolved after one wash. I washed this shirt before ever wearing it (as one should) and after just one wash and never getting to wear it, most of Catwoman disappeared in the middle of her body, just cracked and washed right off. The product info on this shirt states &#34;T-Shirt Will Not Fade, Crack or Peel After Multiple Washes&#34;, not true, this peels/fades/cracks after the first wash. And not in a cool vintage looking way. I doubt I'll end up wearing this shirt now, and for $20, I might as well have just ripped a twenty dollar bill in half and eaten it.",0
4,"The bottom is huge, I wear them and they get dirty on the bottom,so now I have to limit them to inside wear! The rest fits tight just flare at bottom !",1
1,I ordered a size larger than I normally order and it was so tight across the bust (I'm not huge) I do not recommend at all. I sent them back.,0
5,This watch is a automatic watch of grand seiko quality very wonderful Lume  and reserve time quality through out I am amazed for the small price I own tags Rolex and Cartier Oris and Tessot I hold this watch up with them do yourself a favor and buy before there out at this price my partner liked mine so well he ordered one also this week 💯💕👍🏼,1
3,Very nice but Received damaged,0
5,Have used this for years. Waterproofs leather boot great easy to use paste. Just apply and wipe it off. Much less mess than oil products. Odor subsides quickly and boot are oily to the touch.,1
5,Fit perfectly. No issues!,1
3,I thought it would be bigger based on the measurements,0
3,I wear a size 10 shoe and these fit just a little to snug at the top.  I still wear them because I love the colors but I am not sure I would buy them again.,0
1,My daughter wore it once and the seam on leg split! She is special needs and cannot walk or crawl so it wasn’t from being worn in a ruff manner. Cute but not of good quality. Cute outfits for pictures or holidays but not to wear repetitively.,0
1,Broke upon opening package..,0
4,Style was was not what I thought it would be. Very good quality. Nice jacket.,1
2,These are definitely not one size fits all. They stayed up for like an hour but now fall down very quickly. I washed and dried them and it did not help. I do not have small calfs either so I thought they'd be fine. Would not recommend or buy again.,0
2,"I normally fit just fine into the size I ordered, but this was nowhere near my size.",0
1,"The design was very nice, but it doesn't matter because these socks don't fit. It's not a size issue--the material simply has no give.",0
5,They have lasted as expected.  Color holds up,1
3,Very cute! But Product is small. I have an average size wrist and it fit tight. Can’t wear for more than 15 minutes before it starts to be to tight,0
5,gave it to my man and he said its perfect its us,1
1,I don't care for the way it looks or the way it fits. Material is cheap,0
1,Watch fell right apart out of box. Threw it right out.,0
2,do not fit,0
1,So difficult to use and doesn't even stay in the hair. Such a waste of money.,0
5,Comfortable,1
5,"Wao!! I was thinking in some light due to price but I was impressed, heavy consturction at all, this is a must!",1
5,The right size and it was shipped two days earlier than I was hope which was great👌🏾. Looks just like the image!,1
5,"I wanted a slip on/off work boot that was comfortable, durable, steel toed, and oil resistant. I work in the auto industry as a skilled trades Hydraulic Repair guy so I step in a lot of oil. I’ve been working 6 and 7 day weeks for 25 years and these are the best boots I’ve owned. The picture shows the tread after over a year of use. Not bad for a work boot.",1
5,"I like the fit, quality, and price.",1
1,"This product arrived, but the fit is small, and the pattern is not as shown. I also ordered this thinking it would be a dark charcoal gray, and it arrived and is a very very light gray, almost lavender/white color. Not slouchy or loose as shown in the picture. Very disappointed and will be returning it.",0
1,"The upper band is too small and extremely restrictive.  There is no elasticity to the band of the socks that falls just below the knee.  After wearing the product for a day I was in severe pain after removing the socks. The socks when removed showed signs of choking off the flow of blood.  It was as if a tourniquet had been applied to my legs below the knee.  Until the product is changed individuals like myself will not be able to wear this product.  I am 6'4"" and weigh 254lbs.  Copperfit compression socks need to come under review and the elastic band needs to be made larger for us big guys with large calf muscles.  An eight inch band is not going to stretch enough to accommodate 17inch plus calves.",0
2,I have only had this bracelet for a few weeks and it is starting to unravel already . Would like a replacement or refund.,0
2,"I bought this dress with high hopes, and it's a no go. I am 5 ft 10in, and the front of the dress is about 4 inches from my lady parts being exposed.",0
5,My new favorite shades,1
4,"The lace insert on this shirt is really nice and much deeper than I expected. You will have to wear a cami underneath if you don't want your bra to show. I really like the design on this blouse and it is extremely comfortable. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is because the front is not cut wide enough for a large breasted plus size woman. I am a D cup and the fit across the bust was barely enough, but it is cut generous every where else, so if you are bigger than a D cup, I would not recommend this blouse. Otherwise, it is pretty cute.",1
5,"Adorable. I was worried about quality, considering the price. The dress isn't the best or most expensive material I've owned, but it is a super cute dress. There wasn't anything wrong or odd about the one I received. I received a ton of compliments on the dress. I'd recommend this purchase. I'm a size 4 and I purchased the small. The material is stretchy.",1
4,looks nice in jeans and a T-shirt. must buy as a casual watch,1
1,"China product, Did not come as pictured very cheaply made, very thin. Tried to return it and I got no response from the seller do not buy this product. A lot of Amazon clothing does come and shipped from China",0
5,Super cute and perfect for my boho party!,1
4,Cute outfit but kind of cheap. No tags inside to determine front and back. Shorts are made of thin material but ok for hot weather. My granddaughter is 3 1/2 weight 29lbs and 39 inches. Ordered size 3,1
5,Thank you!,1
4,"Sunglasses worked great but frames were too big for my face. These are quality bifocal sunglasses. Contacted seller, quick response, and great customer service but only received 60% of purchase price on return.",1
5,Comfy.  Very big for short people but still looks cute,1
4,Purchased these sandals hoping they would work with a dress for my friend’s wedding. They were perfect. Super cute & comfy while on the dance floor!,1
2,"Arrived scuffed up, with paint/color transfer from something else. Very disappointed! But the bell has a nice sound to it and it’s cute so it gets a little above 1 star.",0
5,"I love this bag! It was just the right size to bring with me on my bike trip to block island for a day! I fit my phone, charging pack, leggings, top, socks, wallet and more!",1
5,Love the look,1
1,I liked it till about a few weeks later when the gold was almost all off and it was turning green,0
1,I ordered an XXL and the shirt looks like a XS. You should be ashame of yourself’s for sending this product out to anyone. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. I will be returning this purchase and hope I get my money back...,0
1,"there was a number &#34;12&#34; indented in the front. that wasn't the reason, but still it was tacky looking. not satisfied at all",0
5,Cute charmes I've been putting them on keychains iv been making there sturdy very cute,1
3,Very nice but threads are already out,0
5,"I love the quality of these shirts, they fit my 3 year old perfect. I will deff by more from this brand.",1
3,Arrived late!  Are cute but too long fit in leg (Goes above the knee). Compression support is very minimal.,0
3,Broke after a month of wearing it,0
5,These are really cute and nice quality beads. They hold up up really well.,1
5,"Fits perfect and oh so comfy, and soft...my feet feel Wonderful!",1
1,"Very thin material, the bra is pointy at the nipple part so it looks real funny. I wouldn't wear it to get wet in, feels like it will be see through. the bottoms fit wierd as well",0
5,I bought this a while back I love it but I hardly ware the thing to give it a true review,1
5,"Bought the belt for use by a Boy Scout on scout campouts.  Have had it for over a year and 10 campouts.  Heavy duty, solid, wears well - great purchase for the price.  Looks official for scouting events.",1
5,Very nice. Arrived in time. Look very good. Love it it's really sparkly,1
5,"This is my 7th time purchasing these, because I keep giving them to friends and family!",1
1,"These glasses are cute, but the quality isn't that great. I took them out of the package, and the lens were all scratched up! If you want LONG lasting sunglasses, I wouldn't recommend these.",0
5,loved them I bought them for my birthday road trip,1
1,Too small!!,0
3,Looks great. The Material is thin so you need to wear black underwear underneath,0
5,Perfect,1
3,Good quality. Bought it for a kid. It was too large.,0
5,Enjoy these socks.  Am thinking of ordering more..,1
5,Adorable bracelet !  The only problem is that the catch is difficult to use !,1
1,Cheap look and way big. Almost a novelty appearance.,0
3,Fit small. Great customer service.,0
5,Bought a few pairs of these earrings and they are super cute.,1
2,Didn’t like how it fit,0
3,"Bottoms for the swimsuit didn't fit true to size, I ordered a Large and they were very small. The top is cute and fits fine, but has the most complicated clasp I have ever seen on a swimsuit.",0
5,"Color is exactly as the picture, looks good, and my daughter loves it",1
2,"Was beautiful upon receipt, but within a few weeks one of the side stones had fallen out. Very disappointed because I loved it.",0
4,"Great scarf-like necklace, not so great communication from the vendor when I had not received it.  My neighbor came home from a business trip and brought it over to me.  Now I'm a happy camper!  Love this necklace!",1
3,Ok,0
2,by the time this arrives the baby will be diffetent size...hurry up,0
1,"Received the wrong mask. Nothing like the picture. I ended up with one that was velvet and had a flower on it. Doesn’t fit my face too well but that’s probably because of the way my face is shaped. It works for the moment, but if this was any other time I would return it and get my money back. Not worth the price.",0
5,"Looks so high end, was not excepting the necklace to be made that well and beautiful casing for the stone.",1
5,"I gave this bracelet to my friend's daughter and WOW..... It is a beauty! Excellent quality, very smart looking with the perfect amount of bling.",1
5,Smooth function and seems very durable,1
5,Beautiful done!,1
1,The watches arrived broken,0
1,"Unfortunately,the knit caps were very disappointing. The caps were not well made either. The Only Good Thing was the Colors.",0
3,Love the dress but it requires hand washing and drying flat.,0
2,"Cheep<br />Try them at night,  didn't  seem to make any difference for glare.<br />Hurts my nose",0
4,Nice and comfy...very big ..get smaller size...nice quality for the price,1
5,It was very nice on. I got allot of compliments i ordered the white one aswell.,1
1,"I ordered a coat, received top, cheap quality ! thin material and even not able to use outdoors ! this is just cheating customers !!! so angry with what I received !!!!🤬😡",0
3,These fit fairly well. They are fun and colorful. I love that they are recycled cotton. They might gotten 4 stars but I don't like the way they bunch up in two places where the fabric is plain.,0
5,I bought it a little too small but was still able to fit and looks professional when paired off with a Blazer. Love it!,1
1,It was too small and was damaged as well,0
5,"I got tons of compliments on this dress and it was so comfortable that I didn't want to take it off! The fabric is nice and soft and it's not too long for my 5'3 height. I'm curvy with a larger bust and smaller waist and the xl fit perfect.<br />The one downside that I found was that the inner part that crosses over would slip down and my bra would show a little bit. I'm going to tack it down to keep it from happening but other than that, this dress is amazing and I plan on getting it in a few more colors.",1
5,My husband said this was the best gift he ever got. Simple understated design!,1
5,Fantastic...give them as gifts when friends lose their dogs.,1
5,"Feels so nice! Smooth cups, and slimming! Great material! Arrived fast too!",1
5,Kiddo thinks they're so comfortable,1
2,Too small,0
2,No. I thought the diameter of the case was gonna be larger. When I saw diagram of the watch being worn. The case looked bigger.,0
5,Although the shirts were somewhat small in my opinion (ordered in a Medium for a thin teenage girl); the fit was great for her. We had screenprinting done on these shirts and we received so many compliments. The gentleman who did the screen print raved about the quality and asked for the vendor. These shirts are definitely great for your money.,1
5,This was easy to install and adjusts to any size wrist.  A great replacement and improvement on the rubber wrist band that came with the Fitbit.,1
5,Extremely helpful with cutting down glare and intensity from night lighting. Well made and packaged.  Great glasses!,1
5,"Like a lot of you gals out there, I'm head over heels for the retro or new vintage look. After taking a shot in the dark on eBay with a used Modcloth dress (too small, but then i had no measurements to guide me), I stumbled across this Miusol dress. It was the delicious color that reached right out and grabbed me.  As I watched the price fluctuate (at one point it was only $9.99!) and saw my size go out of stock, then get restocked over a period of two weeks, I agonized. It was one of the reviews that finally kicked my rear into gear, so I crossed my fingers and ordered a large thinking what the heck, if it's too big I can take in the sides, and if it's too small I'll resell it. Turns out l'm absolutely delighted with it! It's a tiny bit roomier in the chest than I thought it would be, but I can breathe and it doesn't look big, so I'm not going to complain one iota. Just make sure you refer to the Miusol size guide, not the Amazon one, and i guarantee you won't be sorry. Who needs to pay $100 for a vintage-style dress when there's Amazon?!",1
4,Me agrado el color,1
5,My outfit for an 80’s party was perfect.  Everyone loved it❤️,1
5,Perfect for my tiny one!,1
4,"I'm a slim petite, and I wanted something to drape over my bare arms in the hot sun of SE Asia while on a vacation.  This did the job well.  To get 5 stars, it would have to be about 6 inches wider - it's a long narrow piece of material.  I wouldn't wear this as shown, because I'm too short, but I did stash it in my travel purse and pulled it out numerous times to drape over my bare arms and legs - on whichever side was in the sun.  Perfect!  I also soaked it in water to cool me off in Hue, wrapping in over my head and across my neck.  I didn't care about looking cute, I cared about sun protection and not getting heat stroke.  This worked great, and I'd use it again.  It was just wide enough to cover both my bare arms when draped across my shoulders.  If you're super tall, or a regular size toward plus size, I might consider another of their wraps in the same Aerie fabric.",1
1,"The color was accurate. However, this dress looks like the rags Cinderella wore before she met her fairy Godmother!! Cheap, and part of the embroidery looking material on the top was already falling off when my daughter tried it on. The waist was way up high, not at natural waist. We were shocked that the top was completely see-through. Very disappointed. We don’t have time to order another dress, and this dress is unacceptable.",0
5,Fit is true to size. Material is very soft.,1
3,It’s really nice but just way bigger than I expected!,0
1,"Length was not to the floor, more like 3/4 length. Poor quality material, was expecting sweatshirt fabric as advertised. Washing instructions say Do Not Tumble Dry. Now I’m apprehensive to even wash it. I should have sent it back.",0
5,I am happy with the cases that I got.,1
5,Great product !  Made well !,1
5,"great shirt，love this casual shirts for ourdoor travel.<br />Items lightweight and smoothly saw made good quality. true to size, dries quickly if the weather isn't too humid.<br />tips-make sure to order the appropriate size, button-down shirts stretchly limited, not like other flexible shirt. I try seller suggestion<br />to measuring my regular wearing. it fits perfect with room to spare<br />Thank you seller, definitely highly recommended",1
5,My granddaughter lives her slides,1
5,I wear a size 20 and ordered the 3x.  It fit wonderfully. Very flowing. I  average height and it’s below my knees. I intend to order more!,1
5,My girlfriend totally loves these socks,1
1,Construction was way off for size,0
3,"Shirt is super cute. I bought a large since it was the only size it said was available but got delivered a Medium, which runs a bit small.",0
5,This mask is surprisingly breathable and washable in a garment bag. It held its shape when washed and did not fall apart. It is also cute!,1
4,Very cute but a little small. Wish the buttons didn’t feel like they’d fall off any second though. Overall cute too though.,1
5,Easy to wear with tights or shorts.,1
5,Purchased for my granddaughter. She loves them.,1
4,It's a nice print on the shirt the design looks great and stands out. It shrinks quite a bit coming out of the dryer. It was also a bit short out of the packaging. It does look good though.,1
5,They fit really well and looked really good. Very satisfied with the product that I just had to leave a review (:,1
5,Dress is beautiful great material I ordered a large I'm 5'3 36 33 41<br />My only problem was it is way too small in the breast I am a true 36 D and it was so tight my breast were mashed other than that it fit me everywhere else great! I would recommend it just order the right size,1
5,Very nice shirt!!,1
1,Laces are too short to lace through all the holes of a standard workout shoe. Bought “lock laces” afterwards. Money well spent.,0
1,A cute little gift for my grand daughter. She loves it!,0
5,Of all the different pairs I bought these were the best and easiest to put on! Great fit will be buying more! So hook it up with a little discount!!!,1
2,These are so cute and soft but my navy one came with a hole in the arm. I haven’t checked the red one yet UPDATE RED one also had a hole in the arm... Hoping it was just this one because they are really cute and true to size.<br />UPDATE: After washing these two (they came apart in wash on delicate... the seams pulled apart on the hem of the neckline and the one sleeve that had a hole almost completely came unstitched. Poor quality. Don't order or you will be disappointed... also they are not nearly as long as shown on the model... they fit more like a shirt with super long sleeves.,0
2,The color is peeling off :(,0
5,I love the Dress,1
2,Pretty large for cufflinks (probably my bad for not looking more closely) and fell apart on second use.,0
5,Love it,1
1,"Too small, and unable to return. I'm not happy. Can't even exchange for a larger size, etc.",0
1,Paper thin suede and as warm as my ex-wifes heart.,0
3,"normally i would wear a  30 or 31 waist, so i went with the medium size as recommended and thou is fits, the tied cord is what will keep it from falling off and in my case the material is just sagging around waist area, not snug fit at all",0
5,Skirt has wonderful stretch to it and fits well!  I intentionally ordered a size larger than I thought I would need jusy in case but this skirt runs true to size and I could have easily gotten away with my normal size.  Looks lovely on but will require some cool ironing to keep it from turning into a wrinkled mess. Going to take it in a tiny bit and add pockets to make it perfect!,1
1,You can’t wear anything with cleavage. Didn’t realize the tag shown in the picture goes on the top of the breast. Pulling up to give you a lift look. But I can’t wear a dress with straps. Point of a strapless bra is to not show straps.,0
5,Nice fit and nice texture,1
5,Well made and fit as pictured.,1
1,Not at all as described. Very cheap and peplum too high.,0
3,Dislike the material,0
5,"Little one loves it , it’s adjustable and she can breath easily in it",1
5,These are the best work gloves I have found.  I have used them all spring and summer and they are still holding up.  I can't be alone in my review as they are sold out.  Great Glove and Great Price.,1
5,"Great product! Good material, good size!",1
1,"I’m seriously debating on whether or not to keep this bra. I like it, and it’s adhesiveness is great, but OH IT STINKS!!! What is this horrible smell?? It smells like bad fish. I tried washing it, but the stink is still there. I tried perfume last night, but the second you take it off, the horrific fish smell is back. I just may return it and try a different one.",0
1,Defective!!!  The velcro in not in the appropriate places to connect for fastening. Then I have to pay to return this defective product.  I do not recommend this product.  Save your time and money!,0
2,Cheaply made tool for removing extra links. All 3 pieces they included broke. Still have extra links that need to be removed. Now I have to take it to a jewelery store to be fixed.,0
3,The fit was a little weird and the clasp keep falling off,0
3,I'm extremely disappointed with the hat being crushed.,0
5,These are not huge which is just what I wanted. Thanks!!,1
1,The black steel did not last. The connection pieces popped out a lot. Even for this price I expected it to be more durable.,0
5,Great pair of pants. Can wear any place. I use them at work. Plenty  of pockets for your needs. Thanks Amazon,1
5,The best oil,1
1,"Very disappointed in what happened to my daughter as she wore the socks, I definitely didn't look close enough at the picture, looks like there are swastikas on these socks and it was pointed out to her by classmates.<br />Not good!!!",0
2,Wayyyyyy too small,0
4,"This woman's side slit dress/shirt is very cute! The perfect thing to wear with a nice pair of leggings, and a cute pair of flats. The material is stretchy, and also has a lightweight, airy feel to it. For me personally, because I'm not a dress person typically, I would will only be wearing this with leggings under. However this would make a super cute dress without. The side slits to do up a little far though.<br />I ordered a size large, which is what I normally wear, but this is just a little too tight for my taste. I would suggest going up a size.<br />The dress is made very well. The material is perfect. And all the stitching is done perfectly. No holes, frays, or torn stitching. Overall a great item, my only suggestion is ordering a size larger.<br /><br />I recieved this item for free in exchange for my honest, and unbiased opinion.",1
1,When I went to unsnap the snaps to release the buckle the snap broke. I didn't even use any strength or anything was just testing the snap first to make sure it was a snap and not a pen. It broke and now I am afreade to try to unsnap the second snap to put on my buckle.,0
2,"Nice fit.  Sturdy product.  If you intend to match product shirt with pants, Red Kap makes it impossible to do.  I ordered Postman blue pants and shirt.  They were two different blues.  I also ordered an olive set that didn’t match.",0
5,Great present,1
1,"printed both sides, unfinished.",0
1,"I have never met such a terrible item on amazon,also I don't know why there are so many good reviews,have they try the necklace on?this necklace claim Not Allergic,but I feel Itch when I put it on,the quarlity is also hard to bear,to my surprise,it lose color and drop crystal,only after 2-days wear,the following pictures show you the truth,the chain contact with neck fade obviously than the end of the chain,though this is not dear,but it is not the cheapest one,I don't know why it could have so bad quarlity",0
5,I love them they help my aching legs and are so fashionable  I don't come home with aching legs after a 10 hour day.,1
4,Good,1
5,Absolutely gorgeous ♥️👏🏾,1
1,Do not buy if your a migraine suffer they gave me a 3 day migraine in 20 min but they would work well for a normal person,0
5,"These are perfect for what I need them for,I would recommend them. I will buy again.",1
5,fit's great,1
3,ok,0
5,"Lovely, large stoneware type mugs, with fun raised details.  And they are microwave and dishwasher safe.  I love them!",1
2,Didn't really like the fit. I am a 34 DD and I found the cup size too small..also my boobs were squished together so that I looked even bustier than I am. The support was okay but not great.,0
1,"I’m 5’4” and I weigh about 125. I have a large chest for my frame, but I ordered a small. This fit well when I tried it on. Then I washed it. I feel like it came up about two inches in the hem. Very disappointing. The picture has the bottom of the dress at the bottom of the model’s knee. It’s probably about 2” above my knee, which isn’t a problem when I’m standing still. But if I sit or bend over to take care of one of my children I feel like my whole backside is exposed because of the short length of the dress and the flowy nature of the dress.",0
5,Awesome 😍,1
4,"Very good product. Came in a very reasonable time as when they said it would, came with everything that was described. Lenses seem like they will scratch easily, otherwise it would be 5 stars.",1
3,"I feel like this would look best on smaller sizes.  I tried it on and immediately took it off.  I love wearing dresses but this by no means was flattering to my figure personally.  I still gave it a 3 because the dress itself is a pretty dress, just a little stiffer than I expected it to be.",0
2,The bottoms fit fine. The top is way to loose with no support.,0
5,Awesome!,1
2,Cute bracelet but the clasps is hard to adjust. The chain pops easily and the beads fall off. I replaced one just to have the same issue.,0
3,"Glasses are very nice but I'd like to return them as they are too wide and a little too big for my face. But I get a message they are not returnable.  Why?<br /><br />There is clear language in the description...""Customers can return and get refunded for any reason. You have no risk to try"".<br /><br />Be happy to give 5 star rating if I'm able to resolve.  I always check rerun provisions before I order.<br /><br />Please advise options.<br />Thank you",0
5,"Really  nice quality wallet. Barely bigger than the tiny card holder I had before and yet this holds 8 cards, currency, and coins!",1
3,I've never seen anything like this purse.  But it is a huge glitter fest which makes an otherwise classy looking clutch look tacky.  I think I will keep it since it's so unique but I wish it were just a little more muted.  You can't tell from the picture but it blinds you in real life.,0
5,Stylish fan fare,1
5,Thought these were cute so Gifted them to a friend and she loved them,1
5,Very nice pendant with clear lettering. Love it!,1
5,I was impressed with my view during the daylight with the polarized sunglasses.  Thank you Amazon for your committed satisfaction to customers!! One elated customer!,1
5,Replaced the same sweater I have been wearing for over 15 years.,1
2,"The dress (size large) fits well except in the bust. I went by the &#34;size guide&#34; clickable next to the size selection tab, but I think I should've heeded the &#34;Asia sizes run smaller&#34; advice. The color is a bit grayer than expected, and the underneath fabric (front only) is a bit scratchy. Even with color and &#34;scratchy&#34; issues, I like the style well enough that I would've kept the dress if the sizing had been right.",0
3,"A bit itchy, otherwise as advertised.",0
4,"They are purple with a white boarder, I know im splitting hairs",1
1,Bought an XXL. Fits more like a L. The color's are pretty though.,0
1,"it has now starting to tarnish and the plating is coming off, showing whatever interior metal this is made of.it is DEFINITELY not sterling silver. I would return it except that the 30 day return window has closed",0
5,I love it and purchased it in every color,1
5,Love them. So soft and adorable!!!!!!,1
5,These are too cute! I am using them for my secondary and tertiary ear holes. They provide a stunning compliment for my primary ear holes without detracting from whichever I choose to wear with them. Very classic and classy.,1
5,The fit was just as expected. i think this dress would look good on a tall girl. I'm 5'2 and while it still looked good on me this style is more for tall girls. I ended up recommending it to my tall friends and they absolutely loved it. it's a super fun and playful summer sun dress.,1
5,Came as described,1
4,good,1
3,They dont look like the photo. They just look like run of the mill sweat pants.,0
5,I got this sweatshirt to embroider as a gift and it was perfect! I couldn’t ask for a better sweatshirt.,1
3,"Not the color advertised; comes in a yellowish shade, not the cream advertised!",0
1,The sunglasses are disposable. You can only use for few weeks,0
5,"This dress is beautiful, just make sure you size up!!",1
5,I've been through a lot of grabbers as I'm in a wheelchair and need aid reaching things. These are good grabbers. They have a very sturdy grip. Heavier items don't slip out from the tips while you're gripping them. You can hold the weight of a full bottle of water or a ceramic mug easily with just the tips. It also picks up and grips thin items like a single sheet of paper as well. The opening of the jaws is a generous 4 inches. You can rotate the jaw end 90 degrees so you switch which way is most comfortable to grip things. I'm happy I got a multipack as there are just so many uses for a good grabber.,1
5,They arrived in time and they were what I was looking for,1
3,"Wanted this for my upper ear. Was really excited by the snake eye design. Unfortunately, I'm not very good at visualizing the size of things & when it arrived I realized that the snake eye is so very small that you can't see the design without a magnifying glass. Returned it for a refund without ever having opened the packaging. Can't fault the product description, but there should be an ""actual size"" photo included for folks like me.",0
5,Great,1
5,These are so cute and are of great quality,1
5,"Great dress! just got it so don't know how it holds up yet but the material is nice. Runs a little big - fit into a medium and I'm usually a large. 5'3&#34; 155 lbs, most of my weight in midsection and have longer legs. Very flattering around the waist because of the tie. It is short - tied at the waist and folded over a bit, it comes to my lower thighs... Any shorter and I wouldn't be able to wear without leggings.",1
5,Great quality & feel overall! Nice blue color. Very happy with purchase.,1
5,It’s cool! Very stylish. I like the color and the bamboo frame. And very light to wear too. I would like to buy more.,1
1,"Came without the side pieces- had to order separately. Picture of the item includes them and when I've purchased the glasses elsewhere in the past, they were included.",0
5,Love these,1
5,Absolutely love it!,1
5,Bought this for my mother and she adores it. Washes well with no fraying and stains come out of it easily. Super flattering on my mother's bustier figure and hides any tummy imperfections. I'm going to have to get her more of these in different colors!,1
2,These were baggy and wierd.  I couldn't see wearing them in public.,0
4,"I love the smell of the leather.  I love the compartments, and the way the leather feels.  The one thing I would change since it is a bucket bag, is the size.  I think if it were at least one inch wider, I would make it a 5 star review.",1
3,"I love the print but the pant is really wide but manageable. Why 3 stars is because it’s very see threw, I can literally see the tag threw the pant",0
5,very awesome,1
1,Not good quality. My daughter only got to wear it 4 times. The battery would not stay in place so my husband kept taking it apart having to put the battery back in place. Now the arm for the seconds has fallen off and is in the bottom of the watch.<br />Horrible. Do not waste your money!!,0
2,Love everything other than the color or design wears off. Very disappointing.,0
1,"Cute enough. But, the tshirt materials were different. The ladies runs pretty small, I'd guess a full size. Had to send them back :-( out postage both ways.",0
1,it bent as I tried to put it one. It bends as easily as a metal brad found on yellow mailing envelops. Don't waste your money on this one.,0
1,It broke when I try to adjust to the right Strength,0
1,Nylon not sweater material and it's misprinted on the bottom. Would not recommend,0
2,If your head is big these will be to tight I know it says XL but they were to tight on me,0
4,Easy to put on. Feels a little cheap but i will buy more.,1
5,This bracelet was a gift for my niece's 39th birthday.  She loves it... the pairing of the pearl with leather  gives it a casual but sophisticated look.  Can wear for any occasion!,1
3,It’s borderline “costume” jewelry.,0
5,A little darker than expected. Beautiful green color,1
1,"The socks are fine but be aware they are small (size 4.5-8.5), not medium as shown in photo. I bought them thinking they are medium. They are much too small. Guess I will read more closely next time.",0
5,My kids love these pajamas.  Super comfy and they hold up well.  These are go to in our family.,1
1,Not good quality,0
5,"I absolutely  love this it hugs your curves perfectly , it isn't to thin and it's stylish and affordable.",1
5,"Runs a little small, so I ordered 2 sizes bigger and love it!",1
5,Perfect for my daughter’s Halloween costume.,1
5,Solo que debes comprarlo un size menos a tu size normal,1
5,This is a great quality robe and I'm very pleased with my purchase!,1
3,"I like the tropical print and the fit (though the pockets do accentuate my hips) but the material is thin and cheap-looking— it fairly screams, “I was purchased on Amazon.”  It’s a decent casual dress but not as awesome as I had hoped.",0
1,ITS NOTHING LIKE IT WAS DESBRIBE IT LOOKS HORRIBLE I TOOK IT OUT OF PACKAGE AND AT FIRST GLANZE U CAN SEE GLUE ALL OVER AND IS FULLER IN SOME PARTS STLL DECIDED TO TRY ON AND DIDNT HVE IT ON FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS ENDED UP IN MY KIDS TOY BOX,0
2,"I ended up returning it. I did like the way the top layer flowed. It fit everywhere except for across the chest and arms. The material is stretchy but not enough. It made my arms look like sausages and crushed my chest. I am on the busty side (36D) but this shirt was not designed for anyone who has a little extra on top. I normally wear an L top but ordered an XL based on other reviews but that didn't seem to help at all. It was a good quality, long enough to wear with leggings and flattering. I am very sad that it didn't fit in the chest and arms.",0
1,It got a rip in the sleeve after not even a month.,0
2,Very cheaply made.  A button even fell off after wearing them only 2x.,0
5,Great product!!,1
4,Cute and comfortable,1
1,This product did not last 3 months,0
1,The label of the dress says that it is made of polyester and the lining is cotton. But this dress has no lining!!<br />The fabric feels like polyester and very stretchy.,0
5,"Looove this romper! Great patterns for both boys and girls. The fabric is soft and organic. The product does run somewhat small. I ordered a nine month, and after washing once in cold water it already fit my five-month-old (who is on the smaller side!) He has room to grow in it and can probably fit in it a couple more months but it’ll be a snugger fit then. Good price for an organic romper.<br /><br />These will be my go-to for baby gifts!",1
2,Fits too small and arms are too short.,0
3,"My son got this ring for Christmas. Only having worn it a few days, it is turning his finger black (although the description says it will last years without tarnishing).",0
1,"These are not Made in USA Telic shoes.  I ordered my normal size and received a shoe where the quality is severely lacking, and the size is not what I ordered. I held this shoe up to the Telics I  already have, and these shoes are 3/4"" of an inch shorter and my heel hangs off the back of the shoe.  KNOCK OFFs.  Returned.",0
1,Change color the next day after it was worn!,0
2,"Unhappy, this was for our youngest son, had to put three patches on it for his school and now one off the snaps/buttons has pulled through the fabric.<br />Unacceptable. Do not purchase this jacket.",0
5,Look great on very pretty blue,1
5,I use these for my grandson’s swim class.,1
5,"These earrings are beautiful, a bit smaller than pictured but still worth the money!",1
1,Completely see through. They are cute but its like mesh.,0
1,"Don't recommend, hard to use",0
5,Great earings,1
5,"I love this piece, so many complements when I wear it.",1
2,Doesn't keep time accurately.,0
1,"Im very disappointed!<br /><br />After one wash this happened.  I had them in a garment bag too and did not put them in the dryer. It became unraveled from the toe!<br /><br />I don’t see an option for a refund or exchange, can anyone assist?",0
1,Fits an adult.,0
5,Great quality and fit..magnetic clasp is strong and durable,1
4,A nice lower cost alternative to the expensive Pandora and Brighton Beads for my Teen daughter.,1
1,"I ordered an XL (currently pregnant), and there is NO WAY this was an XL. There is no tag in the clothing to determine the size. Sizing is very off.",0
5,The quality of the shirt is second to none. I have LIG shirts that are 20 years old that are still in great shape and still very comfortable. I like the messages on the shirts they all show that “Life IS good!!,1
3,Runs extremely small.,0
1,This necklace is cheap.  It started turning almost immediately after wearing it.  Save your money!,0
5,The only issue is that the arm Barrels are a touch narrow. It’s perfect for my wife! The parkas Are fantastic. I would Highly recommend the product. As a matter of fact I am in Canada and i order it from Amazon USA because it was not available in Canada from Aussie parka. Cindy is fantastic and a pleasure to deal with. Everyone should own one of these swim parkas!,1
1,Waste of money. Just get your ring resized at a jeweler.,0
3,"We keep these bags in our car for when we shop.  They are compact, sturdy and hold a lot.  The only disadvantage is that they are hard to keep open while loading.  It's not a great problem, so overall we are satisfied.",0
5,"Kids love this helmet, and give it a licking, and it keeps on ticking ... batteries are 3 x LR44 and are easily replaced ... picture included",1
5,"Nice and soft material. Nice colors and fit well, stretchy and comfortable",1
5,Quality,1
5,"This is a simple basic linen top, my wife ordered her usual size, and it's a loose, relaxed fit, the fit and the color are just as pictured. The fabric is lightweight, comfy, and breathable, Good price for a 100% linen cloth!<br /><br />I sincerely hope that you would find this review helpful.",1
5,"Very cute, small and a bit hard to put on but once you get the hang of it you are good to go.",1
2,[[VIDEOID:c6f5c355af5253f65429142b3953dfc]] The color on the front is faded like I’ve had it for awhile. After wearing it twice the fabric is piling (little balls).<br />It’s super comfortable and fits great and was thinking of ordering another but the fabric is not holding up.,0
5,Love these!!!,1
3,Very pretty but there is way to much material even when doing a front tuck.  Had to return it.,0
2,"I got a size larger than I normally wear so I could wear pants underneath, they were so tight I couldn't even get them on without pants.",0
4,"Nice , like it  bigger than i tough",1
3,"I ordered this shirt in the purple color and I love it, but it developed a hole at one of the seams after two washings. Not great quality.",0
1,Crap,0
5,Tried several different BIG name brands for running leggings and RBX by far has been my favorite! Bought these for running in the cold. Tested them out on a 4 mile run in 20 degree temps last night and they were fantastic!!! Thick enough to keep the cold out without being too heavy and the thin fleece lining is perfect!  Kept me warm and cozy the whole time. I ordered the size Medium because I have to keep pulling the Large back up as I run. These never slid down and stayed perfectly in place. I'm 5'11 and 190lbs and the length was great on me. Maybe about 1/2 inch up on my ankle but wearing tall socks would solve that issue. 😉  Highly recommend these!!,1
5,Very nice carrying case.  Looks attractive and is protective.  Love it.  Arrived very quickly.,1
2,"I ordered this gaiter primarily for cycling. Masks that stay on primarily by ear loops tend to come loose during a ride, so I wanted something that won't fall off my face so easily.<br /><br />This gaiter looks good at first, with ear loops to help hold it on and a very soft fabric. On first trying it on, I found it was a bad fit - too wide, easily rides up over my eyes, and yet doesn't cling to the face well enough like a mask. More importantly, the fabric is thin, a single layer, and it fails the breath test - if you put your hand in front of the gaiter and breathe out, you feel most of your breath.<br /><br />This may block dust and dirt, which is still important when riding next to a roadway or during dusty conditions, but it's not suitable for wearing in crowded areas or while shopping or at an indoor setting during COVID.",0
1,"This says size 10, but fits like a zero - it is tiny!!!  I can't even get it over my head ... Maybe it's a 10 toddler???",0
5,"pretty! I'm wearing it right now, but I know I have to be careful or it will break!",1
2,The Color is nice but the quality and fit were odd.<br />it also hurt when i wore it,0
2,I ended up getting different slippers these fall off my feet,0
3,the brown is not so nice,0
3,Pretty but too small,0
1,"I loved these earrings enough to buy them 3 times. This was due to them breaking. My first purchase, I was able to wear them several times before they broke. 2nd time they tore up straight out of the package.  3rd time wore them only 2 times - then they broke.<br /><br />Maybe the seller will see this and send a pair that doesn't come apart. I will happily buy them the 4th time if they came with a guarantee.",0
5,Nice necklace. I bought this for someone and she loves it,1
3,Love it!,0
1,"Product is see through, not able to use it for what I purchased it for.",0
5,"Super hot lingerie set!!<br />Red is HOT, HOT, HOT!<br />Fit very well all over!  I am 5'6&#34;, 143 lbs, and 36C (I did fill out the cups, but it looks GREAT that way!!).<br />Love the details!<br />VERY well made!!<br />Hubby will flip out!  Saving it for our anniversary trip... ;)<br />Highly recommend!<br />I have received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review...5 stars!",1
5,Exactly as they were advertised! I love them! Thank you!,1
1,Insatisfacción 😤😤😤,0
5,My 16yr old got a kick out of it for his b-day.,1
5,Love it soft and light,1
5,Fits better then expected,1
1,Awkward fit at the neck line.  I had to return it.,0
4,Beautiful.,1
5,"Excellent quality, no complaints",1
5,The shirt is very comfortable and is made of great material. I wish it came in an XS which I typically would wear a small or medium depending on the stretch of the shirt but this one runs a bit big.,1
5,Cute and fits well,1
5,Feminine and delicate just very pretty. I love it even more than I expected.,1
5,Excellent,1
4,cute,1
5,As described. Nice price,1
4,This is a cute summer hat.  It fits great.  It has a slight give or stretch.  In the picture I pulled it down so it’s snug on my head.  The four parts of the black bow has a stich in the middle of it keep the bow in place.  It's sturdy and seems well made.<br /><br />What attracted me to this sun hat is that it’s easy to pack and can be rolled up easily and not harmed.,1
3,"It will serve it's purpose but the craftsmanship is a bit cheap. The pip posts must poke through your costume, and they pips attach like earrings do. If you look at the underside of the pip, you will see the earring clasp glued inside.",0
3,It's ok. A little small but not ridiculously small like some I have taken chances on. The colors seem brighter in person. Material is decent.,0
4,"Such cute earrings! Perfect for summer. My only complaint, the earrings are not as big as I expected. I was hoping for larger earrings but they are lightweight & cute!",1
2,Too expensive for the quality.,0
3,My only complaint is the fuzz spot which is also dark brown which made me upset bc it was suppose to be all black. The hat fits perfect.,0
3,"It fits me, but it would not fit you comfortably if you were larger than size S, and it's not adjustable. Quality seems ok for the price.<br /><br />I don't really like it. Someone said they curved the plate part and it looked better--maybe that's what I have to do. At the moment, the gold part pretty much spans across the whole front of my waist, and it looks funny to me.",0
1,I don't like the material!,0
5,Love this vest. I ordered it in size 12 and was too large reordered in size 10....,1
3,"I ordered this for my daughter who is 5, and on the smaller side, I ordered a 4-6 and it was way too snug. She wore it for a few dance lessons and now I have donated it. We ordered a 6-8 for her instead! Hope it fits well!",0
1,"They were difficult to line up and maintain when getting them in the ears due to the fact that they were not anchored in on either side. Less than 3 weeks later, they were broken off and in the trash.",0
5,Price and quality are great. It is a nylon braided belt.  Looks good paired with jeans. Bought 2. One for my daughter who wanted a plai belt that she could adjust for her small waist. My husband loves leather braided belts with jeans. Got him this to try. He likes it.,1
4,sturdy and seems to be high quality. but just a little bit smaller than the real one from the video.,1
5,"What a beautiful little shoe! Great quality, great fit! The flower is the perfect touch!!",1
1,Size doesn't match,0
1,Cheaply made,0
3,"The straps felt like they were cutting into my skin, and the cleavage area wasn't as I requested. THE DRESS WAS BEAUTIFUL  THOUGH.",0
3,The tie breaks but just singe it and you’ll be fine cool looking bracelet I’ve gotten 2 but the string breaks forsure,0
5,You know young mothers want to put on sneakers .........nooooo this is what they need to wear,1
5,The material is so super soft! My son is obsessed,1
5,"Didn't order or let alone received these, so Idk y it's in my review section",1
4,"I loved that these sport briefs sat higher on the hip. They also had a very appealing cut and styling to them that I admired.<br /><br />The downsides that I could see is that the waistband wasn't as elastic as I would have liked and the back on some of the pairs didn't stay in place and felt loose occasionally.<br /><br />I have a slim figure (118lbs, 5' 8&#34;) and these briefs really framed my body well with their taller cut. I am a fan!",1
1,It was broken when I opened it,0
5,"Good quality, but a little bit shorter than I expected for 34""",1
1,"Muy decepcionada ,Pedí esto para un regalo y  llego roto y con una pieza que no era de los lentes , rayado y gastado .",0
1,I really do not like these pants; the quality is quite poor. They are thin and shapeless.,0
4,"I have a relatively thin wrist and at first it seemed like this was too big on me and I would have to punch extra holes in it, but after playing around with different angles of wrapping it and having the strap cross over itself I managed to find a way to wear it comfortably as is.<br /><br />This isn't the highest quality leather or stitching(which is why it's not getting 5 stars), but for the look it's going for you don't really expect that.  I do think it will hold up well to regular wear though.",1
4,"The dress is great quality but runs a little small. Outstanding service with questions, and shipping!",1
1,These look nothing like what the package shows. Absolutely disappointed!!,0
5,Nice Watch,1
1,Recieved different colour and quality isnt great. Would not buy again.,0
4,Doing the job. Made my wallet neater. Will order more. Love the price.,1
1,Threw it away.  Terrible fit and awful material.,0
3,"Very flattering and for larger bust size, otherwise too much draping in bust. I had to return.",0
5,Very soft and premium feel,1
5,Great deal. This is my first feed back I never give feed back but very happy with the table for the money was a great buy and they fold up to put away.,1
3,Unfortunately arrived with a small hole in fabric I could not fix or cover which was even more disappointing  because I loved fit,0
3,"The pants themselves are of good quality, nice color. But the waist is way too small. Even after ordering a second pair in the XL, it was still too tight. This was for a man who is only 138 lbs, and short. It should have more give to it.  We gave it to someone else who said it probably will fit him.  I wish I would have known this fact before putting so much money into it ( them)",0
1,"Ad states,""natural turquoise "".Stone setting is so fake,I laugh with disgust,when I opened package.VERY DISAPPOINTED",0
5,It is cool looking and comfortable...worth it big time.,1
3,"Stylish, but pretty complicated to figure all functions out on this watch.  East coast (NY) time is inaccurate, and I have it on another country which matches what my time zone should be.",0
4,"I sized up so it wouldn't cling to my pear shaped bottom. It fit at my hips but then was looser than I would have liked at chest. Bustier women, not me, would fill out top a little better. Ultimately, size down if you are between sizes as it is stretchy.",1
5,"Most comfortable goggles I've ever used - I tried three different ones - all leaked water unless I had them really tight and uncomfortable.  I'm so glad I believed the reviews on this one.  Comfortable, never leaks, rarely fogs and allows me to swim longer as I don't have that pain under my eyes like I used to get. I highly recommend these.",1
5,"So cute! Perfect fit, obsessed! Fast shipping! Thank you!!",1
2,Online it looks really cute but once you see it in person is not as nice. It is way too big and not adjustable. I would not recommend this to any one.,0
1,"Way less than my expectations. Cannot set alarm from device- must use smartphone app. If your phone is out of battery- you can't set a new alarm on the device :( .  The metal battery directly touches your skin. There's no rubber protection- like you would expect. Makes it seem very cheap- I don't want a metallic battery touching my skin all night, every night. It's awkward- if it's cold, it's cold metal touching your wrist.<br /><br />There's 3 alarm functions: sound, vibration, shock. The vibration function is so weak- you can barely feel it. Definitely not going to wake up anybody who already has trouble waking up. The zap/shock feature is surprisingly strong- so strong I threw the watch across the room before it zapped me again. It feels like an electric shock. And this was at 50% voltage power. Realize the zap is directly from the metal battery, where the metal is touching you. There's no silicone inbetween. It'd be nice to wake up to the vibration function if it was much, much strong. It's not even close to strong enough to wake up anybody out of deep sleep. And the zap function is way too strong to realistically use.<br /><br />Overall- it's definitely a 1 star. Returning it immediately.",0
5,Perfect for tween to carry phone and goes with all her outfits. Snaps shut securely so she can carry her instrument and rolling backpack during school.,1

5,Very pretty birthday bead for a great price.,1
2,"I love the look of this, but the first time I wore it one of the outer stones fell out. Unfortunately it's very noticeable so I will no longer be wearing this.",0
1,I received them with a huge hole.  The piece of cardboard they put inside the stocking must of ripped them.,0
1,"This shirt is made of plastic, it’s not even close to clothing. Think dollar store Halloween costume quality and add a exorbitant price tag.",0
4,"Got this for my teenage son for Christmas, and he loved it. It's very attractive and seems well built. A bit thick for what it is IMO, but nice overall. Sadly, the one we got just would not keep time AT ALL. We're talking hours, not minutes,<br />each day. It started losing time at about the 3-week mark after Christmas, so we recently returned it. Also, if you've had analog watches before, this one is actually a chore to set - not like you might think (i.e. twist up or down to move the minute hand forward to back).<br /><br />Still, I'd give it 4.5 stars for the combination of price and looks, we're considering trying again given how many other people like the watch and don't seem to have the issue we did.",1
1,"This is only one piece, while it’s advertised as a 2 piece outfit",0
5,"I'm a Med/Lg so I got and X-Lg. because it said it ran small. I hung it dry and it fit just a little loose. Very nice, thin fabric. Looks just like the picture.",1
3,I wore the band daily for about 3 weeks and the connecting pin started popping out.,0
3,I actually bought these for my grandmother to walk on our wooden floors when she came to visit.  They fit a bit on the small side but over all gave her pretty decent grip while walking. Only bad thing is since the material is so thin one of the straps pulled off on one side of a pairs the first time using it. Other than that no complaints.,0
5,"This watch band and the system design to facilitate replacement of standard bands, was the solution for persons with challenged hands.  A plus was that it is in good style and should last for a long time.  Installing was a breeze with the supplied pins that had a "" no tools required"" method to lock onto the watch. Brilliant engineering.",1
1,Please don't buy these pins for trade at Disney parks. They are fake.  The colors are off and the quality is rough.  Disney should crack down on these because it degrades pin trading.  Who wants to trade their good stuff for junk? They sell great starter sets at Disney.  It's not this cheap but you get what you pay for.  We can obviously tell the lanyards that are full of this junk.,0
5,Quality and fit is nice!,1
5,I love my key chain.  It is very pretty and sturdy.,1

1,"These shoes were adorable. I ordered them in a size 8, which fits with no problem in any other shoes. With these, I couldn't even squeeze my feet all the way into them. The part that was supposed to go between my toes was at least an inch away from toes still.<br /><br />Sizing is way off and I'm really unhappy because I bought them to match a dress for a date I'm going on tomorrow. Now I have to scramble to find another pair, probably that I already own, that will work.",0
2,Cute but runs very small and thin,0
4,Purse was very cute and would have worked great for s themed event. Unfortunately the strap broke the first time I used it. The company however offered me a refund and I was pleased with the outcome.,1
5,Gave as a gift. Very well done,1
2,"was too small.. tried to order according to size chart.  had to give it away because shipping it back was frowned on by the seller, so i gave it away to someone else.  it is a nice shirt, but beware of sizing.",0
3,"Attention bucket-head people, Sarah Jessica Parker, and other people who just have big or long-a** heads!  These glasses are H U G E.  I think I have a large head (like I can't buy regular hats/helmets kinda big) and these glasses looked like a caricature on me.  If you're a cute girl and can get away with hater-blocker glasses, these might work for you.  But the Spicoli ""brahh"" guys are going to look like total D's wearing glasses this big.  LOL  Returned and got the standard size and FREAKIN' love em.  Great glasses, great price, just too daaaaamn big!",0

1,These arrived Broken.. So I sent them back.,0
5,great bracelets for the price,1
5,This unique shape is perfect for my personality.  I will enjoy wearing these.  The color is a lovely garnet.  They stick out from my ear lobe more that I anticipated but I still like them.,1

1,Not good quality,0
1,"This dress I received looks nothing like the dress advertised!  The material is super thin and flimsy. It appears to be a straight line, rather than the full and flowy as depicted in the ad.  Also, the dress on the model has very little to no white.  As you can see from my pic, the dress I received has a ton of white which I do not like. Very, very disappointed!",0
4,"To me, this had thick padding. I prefer a thinner padding. The cup runs larger than it should. Very pretty. I ordered a B size and this was at least a C.",1
1,Just got this today. It is cheap molded plastic. It is flat on the other side and not decorated. The product pictures do not show this.,0
3,Not nearly as cute as I imagined… the pockets for cards are difficult to access. No room for Keys :(,0
5,Seems to work fine and easy to use.  but on thin shirts there leaves the button loose next I plan to use on thick shirts.,1
2,"the dress was somewhat to small, and to young for me. unfortunately I will have to keep hunting for another outfit for my son's wedding.",0
5,These are super cute. THe color is true to the picture.<br />They look even better in person. They do not look cheap at all ( I was worried about this). The fit is true to size. Super comfy and sturdy feeling when walking.,1
1,This was for my granddaughter she loved them.  The problem is they are made horrible 1st time wearing them ripped all along g the seam.  DON'T WAIST YOUR MONET!!!!!!!,0

4,Fits great.  Flattering.  Material is nice.,1
5,"I LOVE these shoes!  Comfortable, super cute and well made. The price is great.  I am definitely ordering another pair. I'm generally an 8.5, after reading the reviews I ordered a 40 instead of a 39, but I probably could have ordered a 39.  Though they are just a little big, due to the cool heel that is raised, they don't slip and are super comfy.  I like a little room to move so I'll order a 40 again.",1
3,"They sent the wrong colors and the ear loops are not adjustable. Fortunately, my boys were okay with what was sent. We ordered the black combo and received silver, purple, and rose gold instead.",0
1,This is the cheap and plastic not worth it.,0
5,"Fun and original ring. I love the detail of the chains around. It is made of stainless steel resitente. It has an incredible brightness. It looks good and looks striking. As always the brand FIBO STEEL not disappoint me. It has become my favorite in jewelry for men. It comes in a black bag. Ready to give to that special man. It is definitely a good buy. It is as you see in the photo. And I promise you will not be disappointed. Definitely a very good buy. I recommend it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

1,this is so small and I order x large,0
4,Fits great. If I could change one thing I would like it to be not so flared out at the bottom makes it look funny.,1
5,What I like about this mask is my glasses does not get steamed up when I’m wearing it,1
5,Bought this as a birthday gift for a good friend and she loved it!  Nicely packaged and good quality. She liked that it was for healing as it’s been a hard year for her.  Love that you can layer different ways.,1
3,"I bought them for a play I was in. They definitely lasted through the four weekend run. They were a bit bulky, and would have impacted my speech negatively, so I just used the bottom, and it was fine.<br /><br />While I appreciate the inclusion of extra molding material, It's nearly impossible to remove once applied. So if I had messed up, I would NOT have put in the effort to replace it.",0
1,Kept breaking 😢,0
4,"I recently realized the importance of sleeping in 100%cotton, and the comfort it provides. So I got the tartan plaid, even though I wanted the red  plaid. The tartan was cheapest, and if I liked it I would buy the red next.<br /><br />Ok the robe does run large. I am a solid 1x or occasionally 2X, and the Xl size in this robe fits comfortably. The fabric is so soft, beautiful traditional colors, and light to medium weight flannel. The sleeves and collar are kinda more than needed, but I could care less.<br />I have not washed or dried, but I will be carefully as I have not room to shrink.<br /><br />So my cost came out to right at 20$, and I would say the robe is about worth 35$- simply due to the fact that most store don't sell 100% cotton robes. The major departments are mostly selling fleece or poly blend.",1
5,Super cute and comfortable,1
4,Positive:  The fabric is terrific.  Great weight and colors.<br />Negative:  No mid-size (33) available.  Belts are relatively useless.,1
1,"We have owned this for a year, and sadly now have to throw it out.<br />The whole thing is made out of paper and cardboard, and the paper<br />does not stay glued. The top inserts that hold the hanger rods are already coming apart, even though there was hardly any weight on them. The only way to fix this is to take it apart and reglue it using stronger glue. Unfortunately, while we were doing this, the whole insert structure ripped apart, since it is made from cardboard. Looks good from the outside, but beware, it will start to fall apart within a year, and you will have wasted your $90. Buy from another reputable company, not this one.",0
3,decent product.  But very fragile.,0
1,Poor quality,0
1,"Loved everything about the coat...but the zipper completely ruined it. It busted 2nd day I had it. Returned it, got a new one. Same exact thing happened. It's too bad, otherwise I loved it. The length & warmth was awesome.",0
5,"Amazing! So happy to find actual gorgeous, high-quality feminine face masks. I also notice my makeup rubs off less with these. Came in a cute little dust bag. Love the colors too!!!! So much better than any other mask I’ve purchased in this crazy year.",1

5,Very nice product. Meets my expectations.,1
5,"Nice comfy shirt, it can be worn on the shoulder as a scoop neck too!",1
1,"This product is complete junk.  It would not fit over my girl friend's head.  It would barely fit her 15 lbs pug.  Furthermore, it was more yellow than ivory.  I returned it 1 day after I received it.  Do not buy.",0
5,Love this dress . Very flattering and a beautiful color . I’m only 5 feet tall and the length is a little long but still flattering,1
1,"The wrist band broke the first time I put it on my watch. Unfortunately, it was too late for me to return it.",0
3,Great but the light only lasts as long as you hold the button and the strap started peeling my skin,0

4,"Good for traveling, and when you have your period, just throw it away at the end of the day",1
5,I love these shorts! I almost wear them every other day! I ordered a medium and might try a small next time. I’m 5’10” and 130 lbs. these are perfection! Order them! Super comfy!,1
5,Cómodos y buena protección del u.v.,1
3,a button came off on the first one it's just a glue on the snaps,0
5,"I like the appearance and the price was reasonable. I received them more quickly than I expected and they were nicely packaged. I wish they were also colored on their backs or that the two were mirror-image, but that's a very small issue. They look great.",1

1,thin & cheap--- with a liner???? skip this one in spite of the great price---,0
5,"Contrary to what it's normally used for, I use this polishing cloth on my silver trumpet and silver flute the day of a performance. I usually wipe down the instruments with a rag to get some of the dirt off, then use the blue side to buff it, and then the cream side to polish it.<br />Even with tarnish coming off onto the cloth, it still does a great job. Very good quality product for a reasonable price. Great for jewelry, but it's great for literally anything silver (including instruments), and doesn't do any damage to the item being polish. Would totally recommend this.",1
2,Runs small,0
1,Pretty but the pockets are thick and bulge out right by the hip adding &#34;10 lbs&#34; to your figure. Returned!,0
2,"Alert to other buyers: Pricing of $14.99 is on this product's tag, which I bought for over $20. Poor value.",0
5,Very pretty dress!  A bit full in the skirt so it will be for a little dressier occasions.,1
5,I love this dress. It is very comfortable and perfect for the warm days when you want to be cool without wearing shorts.,1
5,"This jumper is fabulous. It fit so well and was so comfy that I  put it on and wore it out the day it arrived. Normally when I buy clothing from Amazon I order one to two sizes up depending on the style. This one was no different. I typically wear a size large and I got this in an XL. It fit a little loose, but I wanted it that way for comfort. I am an hourglass shape, 5’4” and typically wear a size 12. I love the length of the shorts and the soft cotton/polyester blend of the fabric. It’s lightweight but also breathes. I love it so much, I hopped right back on Amazon the next day to tell you ladies how fabulous it is and to order another one in another color. So if you’ve made it this far in my review, I will summarize by saying: BUY IT!!!",1
1,Don’t purchase,0
5,"I love lightweight crew neck sweatshirts, and this one fits the bill perfectly! Perfect and highly recommended, and I am not even from California...just love the Bruins ;-)",1
4,Good quality and great fit.,1
5,Looks and fits great.,1
5,Nice pair of socks,1
5,Comfortable material and hasn’t faded with washing,1
2,As a North Face product I expected it to be warmer than this thin material.,0
3,For the price this is a good item.  I had to glue a few of the pearls back into place right after receiving.  Would probably work good on heavy scarfs.  I was planning to use on cardigans to help keep them closed (no buttons on sweater) but pin is way too heavy.,0
2,"Not a horrible shirt but it's NOT what I ordered. The material advertised is thicker, softer and more stretch. This one has a higher neck and the material is thinner and RIBBED. However, it does have some stretch. I'm disappointed, I ordered this item for a vacation next week. Not what I wanted and will likely return.",0
5,Good looking and functional,1
1,Broke first week. Not well made.,0
5,Very good!!!,1
4,"I bought the matching joggers and was disappointed when they ran small. So, when I saw this jacket I sized up, thinking it ran similar to the pants. I was wrong - this pullover is true to size so now I have joggers that are a little too tight and a pullover that’s a little too big but I’m going to wear them anyway because they’re just so cute and made of such a soft fabric! I love the color and the lightness of it all - this is definitely a spring pullover or something to wear as a warm up for workouts as it doesn’t have any fleece lining. I think it is extremely well made and looks much more expensive than it is but I wish I had ordered a Medium instead of a Large as I think it would look more flattering if it was a tad more fitted.",1
2,"They ran too small, couldn’t get them over my thighs",0
4,"It was better than I expected. I don't buy bags a lot, but I needed something bigger and this is just the right size. I love that it had two straps and then an extra strap to make the bag longer. The only problem I have is that one of the shoulder straps already broke and I've only had the bag less than two weeks.",1
2,Itchy,0
5,"For me, like the package said, DON'T RIDE UP YOUR LEG..",1
1,Broke within a week.,0

5,Amazing hat. Ears stand up perfectly!,1
1,"A. Birthday gift, the day is was supposed to arrive, I get a notice that it's been damaged? Never again thanks a bunch!",0
2,Design is good but the quality is bad,0
2,Disappointed in how thin and cheap this hat seems.  Can't imagine how something so thin would adequately protect the top of one's head from the sun.  My husband had a hat once that was thin like this one and he got sunburned through it.  I'm returning it.,0
5,"Perfect size, scale for Elf on the Shelf to leave short messages for kids. Durable and plenty of letters to leave real messages! SUPER quick shipping too!",1
5,"I like the fit of this dress! For reference I am 5'5&#34; and about 140lb. I got a medium amd it fits me perfectly! I get most dresses in size small or medium, and it's stretchy enough a small may have worked as well. It's about knee length with the bodice being fitted but not tight and I love the loose twirly bottom. The sleeves come down a bit below my elbow, 3/4 length. The material has a nice soft cotton like feel to it. If you are looking for a cute, affordable little black dress I don't think his one will disappoint you.",1
1,"*This review is for the solid color baby pink dress*<br /><br />I can't speak for the patterned dresses, but the solid color pink dress is absolutely hideous, for several reasons.<br /><br />1. The picture shows a very, very light baby pink color, almost white. The dress I got is a bubblegum/cotton candy pink - super tacky. Ew!<br /><br />2. This dress is not made for women with breasts. The smocked top is supposed to cover your chest, then the dress is flowy under your chest - like a babydoll. But this is not how it fits. The smocked area is just not long enough to cover medium or large chests. I think an A cup will fit, possibly a B. Anything larger and you'll be popping out either the top or the bottom.<br /><br />3. The fabric resembles a bed sheet.<br /><br />4. The sleeves are attached to the dress by a thin stitch. Honestly, they might as well not be attached at all.<br /><br />A huge disappointment. I expected more from a $40 dress.",0
2,Wasn't impressed. Glasses made little difference in reducing glare from lights and didn't improve on any clarity at night.,0
5,I love this top. I purchased this to take on vacation with me. I wished I had purchased more of them for my vacation. I will be purchasing more in the future for summer time. It fit so cute and covered all of my problem areas perfectly. I highly recommend this top.,1
5,Very comfortable. I love the adjustable tops. I have problems with foot swelling and the ability to loosen or tighten is wonderful. Foot bed comfortable. My new go to shoe for around the house.,1
5,Love love love these glasses! It was really hard to find Tortoise shell glasses where the lens are dark.,1
1,I tought it was a good product until it broke 2 months later,0
3,"Weird material won,t decrease after wash. Creases remain",0
3,"Was great for the first few wears but after that the buckle screw unhinged and hung down, didn't look good after that and was basically useless",0
2,"Watch broke after a month of normal usage!! The wristband just snapped off today... A shame too, because this was my favorite watch.  I loved it, and recommended the brand to people.  Definitely a disappointment!",0
5,The dress looks fabulous I love the pattern which  I usually don't wear pattern clothing. This pattern however is wonderful.,1
5,De muy buena calidad y queda muy linda . Recomendada !!!!,1
5,Adorable and affordable boots for littles. They ran small and have an incredibly strong smell,1
5,My fiancee love ❤️ it,1
3,"This chain, while nice and big and sturdy, is not my style. I thought there were three options in the order, a small medium and large.  But after receiving it and inspecting my order further, I actually ordered the wrong one. Such is the way of the Vine, but I digress.<br /><br />Preparing for a Christmas party, it occurred to me that I could really enhance my Christmas suit with a mock turtleneck and chain! In a flash, I was Philly and NYC rolled into one!<br /><br />I actually like the chain - for what it is. I would never wear something like this on a normal day so to have it in my arsenal of party going goofs and spoofs and gags - this fits right in!<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this chain to my friends and relatives who wanted one for a specific purpose, like a costume party, other than wanting a nice cuban link chain, and rate it three stars.",0
5,My terror of a toddler can’t wear these things out.  This is the second pair.  Will buy again and again until he is 30.,1
5,So pretty. Great length and doesn't look cheap. Gets tangled a little easy so just make sure to hang up when not wearing,1
3,I love the style though they are a bit heavy to wear all day for me.,0
3,"It's a little tight around the neck,Other than that I like It!",0
3,"A cute, very light earring.  Good for wearing all day or for casual occasions.  The finish is good.  Marked down some because posts bend easily and the backings are plastic.  Doubt they will last a long time but they are attractive as long as they last.",0
5,It’s a little more snug than I would like. Great other than that.,1
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you,1
2,"My 14 year old daughter purchased this bra. She wore it yesterday under a blouse. Unless you wear something super thick, the lace will be seen. The bra itself does not offer support. It's strictly for appearance. This is not an issue with her too much...yet but it's something I always notice since I have a large chest (34G) and she isn't exactly flat chested (32D). I would not recommend this bra for anyone who requires a supportive bra.",0
1,This outfit could be beautiful if you have a body like Megan Thee Stallion.  I'm 5'4 130pounds it was not for me. The pants were too long and the middle of the pants sag. The top was loose fitting and I have nice size breast. 36DD I ordered a size small and it definitely fit like a medium on me. So if you curves 😉 this outfit would fit you best.,0
5,This is a nice size and made well.  Would make a nice gift,1
5,This choker arrived earlier than the day usps predicted for it to arrive. This item came in quick! Which I like. :) The choker looks exactly like the one in the picture and it's comfortable to wear also. It was worth the money :) I can't wait to wear it for school! :D,1
2,The necklace chain turned black after a month,0
5,looks nice,1
5,"My first package was delivered with a hole in it so no product. I think on the resend, they sent the wrong colors (green and black but I LOVE the new bands. Super easy to get on and off, very light and comfortable, like you're not wearing anything.",1
5,"This outfit is really cute and perfect for the cooler weather! My son normally hates hats, but he doesn’t pull this one off and will actually take a nap in it. It fits as expected, and didn’t shrink much after washing and drying it. I love the little tag on the hat. The “I love you this much” on the wrong is so cute and makes me really happy when I see it. The snaps make diaper changes quick and easy, so that’s awesome for us parents!",1
5,Awesome,1
2,Too tight at the top.  Returned.,0
5,"Beautiful wallet, bought for a christmas present.",1
4,The corset is absolutely beautiful! The fabric is soft and silky. The embroidery is very detailed. Overall I would recommend this to anyone! The only issue is that the shoulders are really broad. I will have to add a hook and eye clasp to pull them up otherwise they hang and pull down on the corset.,1
1,This dress came in with the cheap thin material and laid flat as a pancake. Very unsatisfied,0
5,"These earrings look small in the hand, but they are a good size in the ear.  I was attracted to them because of their interesting shape.  Now that I see them in person, I can’t help but think how masculine they look. They remind me of bolts.  I can definitely envision these on a hot male.",1
5,Good product. Color was more (dusty pink) than it looked online.  Not a very pretty color but otherwise it was great!,1
1,The dress looks nothing like the picture I returned it.,0
1,Looks different from the picture and is awkward to put on.,0
1,Very cheap material. Feels like paper and potato sack.,0
1,"When I opened the package a very strong chemical smell came out. Even after soaking and washing it’s not gone. The colors bled during the cleaning process. Also, these are more like a cap than a snood. They are also made from some kind of sus string, not yarn. I had to throw them away. I should have known better, but the least I can do is to warn away other potential buyers.",0
5,"This was a gift for a very frequent traveler!  She love them!  Like she said, &#34; I feel very cosmopolatain wearing them!",1
5,Nice socks! They are breathable and comfortable. Would buy again.,1
3,Looks nice but the belt latch seems to slip at times.,0
1,I thought this year was going to be like the smaller sizes I got for my other son but they are nothing alike. The top of the shoe is completely mash and looks like a very cheap quality. Also the shoe was a full size too small. I would not recommend this product.,0
4,Very nice very soft,1
2,"When it came to band part of the hat (where the visor is), it fit so tight I felt like I was going to faint. Because it was so tight there, the baggy part of the hat (top part) it looked way too big.",0
4,I ordered a size up and it fit.,1
1,This is clearly made very badly and is the biggest shirt I have ever bought expecting it to fit me.  It's cheap as s*** but very comfortable.  It doesn't fit anything like the photo.  It's actually shaped like a big square.  It just hangs off of you.  I wouldn't waste my money unless you were planning on turning it into a pillow or something with the fabric.,0
5,am very pleased with this purchase!  GREAT PRICE !  Unique bamboo sides get quite a few compliments and very comfortable to wear.<br />Will buy more as gifts!,1
4,These earrings are beautiful and will go with any outfit. I'm glad I purchased.,1
1,The chain not secure.....,0
5,Very Nice and am pleased with product,1
5,"Very nice color, fits good, comfortable and well made. Would order again.",1
3,Very long!,0
4,It’s very cut but it’s small so I send it back,1
1,It didn’t work 🤨,0
1,I've had them for less than a year and the polorized coating is rubbing off of the lenses. I've never had another pair of sunglasses do that. Cheap materials and no warranty.,0
5,"I liked this one. This in ""musthave"" for every single blonde girl. Ladies be careful! If you are not that much lighter blond and by accident you got yellow color this mask exactly for you.  It kills yellowish tone and make your color look richer. BUT. If you are platinum blond and you got yellow color do not use it. You need to light up your yellow roots and after to use. Other way you will get yellow roots and blue hair. Hair after this mask silky, soft and shiny. I love it",1
2,There was a hole in the butt check. Not in a seam but randomly in the cheek,0
3,Only received two pairs of the socks in the package.,0
5,A bit pricey but well made and does not tarnish. These are regulation size.,1
5,Love the mask its for a wedding,1
3,Its pretty but it's not comfortable at all. It digs into my wrist. I cant even wear it. Not very easy to tighten and loosen with 1 hand.,0
3,These fit pretty small. The material is also thin meaning you can see underwear lines through them. Really pretty color though. In hindsight I wouldve ordered the Small not XS. I'm 5'2 and 113lbs,0
5,Love these glasses so cute & trendy!! Came fast in perfect condition wear them with everything!!! 🖤,1
5,"Fit well, look as described",1
2,"The colors of the shirt’s artwork are not even close to the brightness and quality shown in the product image. The artwork looks washed and faded, like the shirt printer was running out of ink. I expected better.",0
5,Love it,1
5,"I love it! Although, I haven't found a time to wear this yet, but I did try it on and it fits perfectly and I can't wait to wear it out in public.",1
1,Looks ugly and cheap! Don't buy is not even worth a dollar!,0
1,Tiene un orificio por la parte de atrás de donde trae la etiqueta  .,0
2,"Pro: Fit as expected, got print001 very pretty.<br />Con:  I thought the bottom area was a bit too big in terms of length.  But the biggest con:<br /><br />IT STUNK!  And, it smelled like  a very strong petroleum, I was scared it was cancerous!!!",0
5,Perfect!  I was worried that they (a) wouldn't sit flat on my nose; (b) would be too long and pop out of my nose and I'd constantly be pushing it back in; and (c) would be too large.  They're perfect.  It fits perfectly.  I'm so happy because I spend $6 on one of these in the mall!,1
3,"Super cute shirt, soft fabric. BUT it fits very small, order up at least a size.",0
4,The product is good. I was just a little upset because I didn’t get some charms pictured. Basically snowflakes were shown in every picture and I didn’t receive any.,1
5,Great fit,1
5,Was a little large for a size large because I wanted it to be oversized but it was a little to big but it had great quality and was worth the money,1
5,Arrived early... Correct color,1
5,Will order more,1
1,My daughter wore them once and crotch ripped out had to sew them up. Otherwise ok just a pain to deal with.,0
2,"The material is kind of like a bathing suit type of fabric. It's slick, thin, and a little stretchy. I really like it and the style was something I would wear often on these cool to warm days. The problem is that it's way too small. A medium was super tight on me. I was able to zip it up, but it felt like it was a glove or sausage casing. The picture shows something looser, and that was not what it looked like on me. It's too bad, cause its good quality and style. So I would recommend ordering a size up if you plan on buying this.",0
4,I love this ring! But... it is a little smaller than most. The ring its self is just a little bit smaller but other than that I love it. It's super cute. It's not quite as shiny as the picture.,1
3,I little difficult to use. Doesn't pull down over face so easily.,0
5,I love this dress I can't wait to wear it,1
5,"Fit perfect, strong real corduroy, classic color. I bought 4 different colors, glad I did. AV",1
1,Broke first day,0
3,Love. It,0
5,"Love this Top for casual wear, or dress it up with a pop of jewelry, easy care",1
1,"I was initially pleased with this gown--until I washed it.  It was a light pink, but after washing it, unfortunately with a load of whites, beiges, and light colors, it is now peach colored from bleeding dye.  I have NEVER had light pink to fade.  The rest of my laundry is also peach-colored.  I will be returning this instead of ordering additional gowns.  IT IS NOT COLORFAST.  DO NOT ORDER.",0
5,Love these sandals.  They go with everything.,1
1,Product did not meet expectations; material too thin to hold shape and low quality product.,0
2,"As other people mentioned, these sizes run small, but I decided to take a chance anyway. I am a small usually, and fit into a small for the PJs, but friends who were larger were not as lucky. The tops are easier fitting, the shorts are very tight and cut weird, got stuck in between your legs. Wanted to use these as bridesmaids gifts, had to return.",0
5,I love these shorts!,1
5,Bad ass wallet well made would buy another one.,1
1,"Cheap, don't bother.",0
2,"Fit really weird. VERY tight and very long in the sleeves and body. Not for me, I returned. I would not get a size larger.",0
5,Made well and looks beautiful.,1
5,Here in time for Christmas!,1
5,"I really like this design  because it is really helpful. Its polarized lenses helped me to see objects more clearly, and also helped reduce the harmful effects of UV light.<br /><br />I was able to have a fair amount of discount of this product in return of my honest and genuine review. I have nothing to do with any promotional activities doing by the Company of this product.",1
5,This top fits good n is very comfortable.  It’s washes up great.,1
5,As expected,1
5,I got this for my teenager son.  He really like that its very thin and serves a simple purpose.  It has held up for a while now and even managed to make it through a wash cycle.  Impressive.,1
5,Love this bag!,1
5,So pretty!! Soft feel and good quality,1
5,I have a very picky teenagered step daughter and she loves the color and the way it forms her body. I love it!,1
1,It was pretty however the cords were very stiff and broke the first time I wore it.,0
3,"This product was a little large around the bust, I'm a 38DD, and ordered an X-Large. I think it was mainly how the garment was sewn, the bust gaped at the sides even with the straps adjusted. If it had one more dart in the breast it would have solved the issue. Also the material was a little cheaper quality then I thought for a 60+ dollar dress, It was stiff and not as flowy as I imagined. Also as another reviewer wrote, my dress arrived with dog or cat hair all over the skirt. Very unappealing and gross. I would not order from this seller again.",0
2,ends of fingers are too large,0
5,It is really great it the pool it just takes some time getting use to it.,1
1,Power Cord doesn't work...stoped working after 1 day...very disappointing. ..,0
5,Perfect for the price,1
1,"It fit like a small, not a one size fits all. I usually love one size fits all because they are loose and big, this was far from loose and comfy. Very disappointed!!",0
1,"I was so excited about this belly ring. I'd been wearing a dangly one for months, and I really like it, but I'm trying to expand my collection. This item came rather quickly, HOWEVER. It did NOT come with the TOP BALL!!!!!  I am very disappointed.",0
1,Batman is DC comics not Marvel.,0
2,Fits tight,0
5,"Perfect fit on my prescription glasses, I love them!",1
5,Great,1
3,"Top fit fine - due to the other reviews that mentioned top was big, I ordered a large.  However - no way was I getting my butt into the bottoms! TOO small.  Please consider making an option to order different sizes for top & bottom.",0
1,I don't recommend buying  this.. soon as I went to put it on my ankle it broke in to pieces..  what a waste of money.. I  would prefer  that they send me a new one.. 'Considering this product was so cheap..,0
5,Sizing is perfect.  Very happy with quality,1
5,"So, I read it fit to small, I usually wear a medium so I ordered a large. It seemed a little to big. Had breathing room. Maybe order ahead of needing it so if it doesn't fit right you can exchange. Don't know what it would of been like if I ordered medium",1
1,I am always a medium. This is tighter fitting than it should be for a medium.,0
3,item still was a little too big,0
5,Seriously the best drool bibs made!! Under side of bib stays completely dry and keeps baby dry!! Really soaks up all the drool!,1
5,First time I’ve ever spoiled myself buying more than a $15 pair of sunglasses. You can feel the difference in quality right away and the copper lens really make the colors of a sunny day pop. 1 month into ownership and I love them. By far the most comfortable and sharp sunglasses I’ve ever worn.,1
1,Did not like it and had to be returned strap broke!,0
5,Ordered a Black and A brown one. Love them both! Great price!,1
2,I have owned several wind up pocket watches. This one has a weak main spring that broke after a couple days. T did not over wind it.,0
5,"It's beautiful, but the size is 2cm x 2cm, the whole cm less than in the description. Attached is a photo of pendant compared to a US quarter coin for your reference. Other than that it's very nice and of good quality.",1
4,Nice fabric,1
2,I bought this as my mother has lung cancer. The picture shows it as one connected bracelet.  Mine came in the mail separate and I can not get them together without breaking it.,0
5,"fit great, nice for the warm Florida weather",1
5,Used the hitch covers on both my cars. Looks awesome.,1
2,"It's a pretty necklace, but the heart rhythm on it is malignant. That is the heart beat of someone who is probably going to die soon. It's a nice piece for someone who doesn't mind wearing some poor sod's death rattle around their neck.",0
4,"Would buy again, only negative is they came in all smashed up and flat in some areas.  Update bought two more pairs get price for the quality just all 3 came in different sizes but bought same size for each ... 2 pretty much true to size and one larger.",1
3,"It was a little longer than I anticipated, but it fit and wore well.",0
1,Terrible and super small. No where near the fit. Buyer beware.,0
3,"The watch keeps good time so far, HOWEVER, I bought it mostly for the glow in the dark minute and hour hands but, no matter how much light you shine on them, they DO NOT glow. Just be aware. Q",0
3,"I did like the necklace but the packing was very disappointing I was thinking of giving it for a present and I had to go and by a really good case, I mean I don't expect fabulous packaging but at least I wood expect a little paper box were the necklace cud arrive.",0
4,"I like how this bag was the right size for what I needed.  I don't like to carry my purse at functions or leave my purse behind to mingle.  I loved that I could just put it on my shoulder and it wasn't in the way, and I was hands free.  Small, lightweight, and my cards, lipstick, money and phone fit in it perfectly.",1
2,Wasn’t a fan of this bra so I returned it. It wasn’t supportive enough for me.,0
3,Not sure if they were just too big for my feet but they were sliding off my toes.,0
5,Great product,1
5,"This is a very nice wallet at a very attractive price.  I have not tested its RFID-shielding, yet,  This is attractive, functional, and matches the Amazon ad.  With the window pockets in the center, it is a little thicker than my previous wallet.  It is intended to replace a black wallet of a different design, that is very thin and unobtrusive.  But that one cost more than twice the price.",1
3,weird fit but very soft,0
4,Bathsuit is very cute the colors are beautiful the only problem is no wire support and it runs big,1
5,These are just as pictured. Very sparkly and good sized. Took a bit to arrive but I am pleased with this purchase!,1
5,Matched great to my husband tie for a wedding he preformed.  Our sons wore these.,1
3,"Good color. Much flimsier than expected. The description said ""linen,"" which I knew it wasn't, because it's cotton; but I figured that referred to the feel/durability of the fabric. But no, it's flimsy and I'm sure after washing the sizing out of it, it would be flimsier still, and it hasn't got much shape, so would not add anything to my life.",0
3,I like the bracelet and for the price it is pretty good my only complaint is that the closure does not stat closed but I chnged the closure myself so it's ok.,0
1,Too large bigger than what I expected,0
2,Bought a large based on the sizing grid but it was way to large in the arm holes.  Good length but material was really thin.  Wish it had been lined also b/c it definitely would have needed a slip or something if i'd worn it instead of returned it. Very sad to return b/c i was otherwise in love with this dress.,0
5,"I haven't gotten them wet, so I can't speak on behalf of them being waterproof but they are so comfortable!! True to size.",1
3,Blue not as bright as picture.,0
5,"execelente, the size is what I expected, super comfortable, my daughter is happy ....",1
5,"Very comfortable, size was perfect !",1
1,This shirt is awful. It's poorly constructed; the side seams twisted on the first wash. There was a horrible smell when I first took it out of the package. Another reviewer has a picture of the front design where it's not sewn together. Weird. Check it out. The only thing I like is the color (light green) but i regret spending money on this.,0
3,very big not good form me size should small that is fine no worry ok thanks,0
1,Don't buy,0
3,"It's a good shirt, but the buttons are to big.  They make weird clink sounds when I walk, and they just get in the way.  I ended up removing the buttons and I like the shirt a lot better.",0
5,"Love these leggings, they're great",1
3,I like it.  For the price it is great!,0
1,Wrinkled jacket in a plastic bag. NO PANTS! What a waste of time..,0
4,Once I adjust the top part it will be very nice,1
1,Way to large,0
3,My son saw this in a catalog & wanted it badly for Christmas. I don't see him getting two winters out if this thing but he loves it & that makes me happy.,0
1,Into the garbage within a couple minutes of receipt.  Way too short to do anything with it.,0
3,Dress is beautiful but runs small. Should've ordered a size larger than usual,0
2,Too big.,0
1,Bought like 7 and it’s bad fabric and buttons all fall. The waist stretch is awful. The pants are ready to be put in the garbage,0
1,I like the polka dots however they run really small. Panties cut into my thighs and hit just above my butt. Design is not good. I do not recommend,0
5,I bought as an additional face cover due to the coronavirus. It is comfortable and fits well.,1
5,I have flat feet and they are narrow...so wearing heals is not fun for me.  I've had to suck it up and realize that I need to spend the extra money on shoes to be comfortable.  These look great with a dress and with jeans and I can walk forever in them.  Perfect sandal for me!,1
5,So pretty and great price! You can't go wrong with this!,1
3,It’s not made out of pima cotton at all. Just a regular cotton which is not as smooth as it should be. Over priced,0
5,"I bought this to use on my Cloth face mask. I hate touching it because it’s slipping, or because it fogs up my glasses. This tape works great, and it doesn’t damage my skin when I take it off.",1
5,"Good quality watch band. Fit well, and the length adjusting tools were very nice to have included.<br />No complaints here as I got what I hoped for.",1
1,Way bigger than that look. Not really a fan.,0
1,"Crotch is way low, can't kick above mid thigh level. Washed them hoping shrinkage would take care of issue, but no. Past return window, have no use for these.",0
4,"These work well, but seem to be a bit too small to handle easily when trying to get them into the button hole. Once they are in, it's all good.",1
1,"Wow, just terrible.  Runs small, has a short waist, and the white is sheer.  There are seams near the bust, and they’re just awful.  Returned promptly to the nearest drop off location the day I got them.",0
1,These are not crew socks. They are shorter than the picture.,0
1,Great product just very small.,0
1,"Way to flimsy for most masks. Kind of works okay for the disposable surgical masks, but even then the elastic some still pops off the grips.",0
3,Was not the material i thought it was going to be made out of its not soft at all (that i can live with it thos stupid wire in the center it wont stay in place and its sharp,0
3,A little flimsy.,0
1,Ripped the first time I wore them,0
5,Helps with breast pain following chest surgery.,1
1,Not flattering.,0
2,"This is advertised as an African dress but, it looks Indian.  The material seems orgins are in India. If this is African, what tribe designs dresses using this type of material and style of dress?  Its too tight across the chest therefore, I was unable to pull it over my head and down. The head scarf is sheer, very unusual for African attire and traditionally it is used to wrap your hair.",0
5,Great,1
3,Thin.,0
2,Very cute but they sent me the wrong color pattern and the material is tight. Definitely size up,0
5,My son is very pleased with his backpack. The material seems durable so far!,1
1,"I love the pattern, but the fit was very strange. So wish it would have worked",0
1,"Careful when buying this!  Got it for my little girl for Christmas, put keys chain on my keys NYE and it has already broke off-kind if cheap!",0
4,"I love the look, the style, the flow, but it definitely runs small. I also thought this was fading into black, but it is white and blue.",1
1,Tacky  Too thin,0
5,This is a really cute &#34;dress&#34; when I add leggings. I'm too tall and it's made for smaller framed women. I read the sellers' size guides so I knew what I was getting.,1
5,It makes great bookmarks,1
1,"I had to rewrite my review. I love my original pair of the grey seamless leggings however when I purchased another color/ style I don’t like them at all. The color is pretty, but they are not squat proof like my Grey ones. They seem to be also defective with the color. These are not seamless and mark everything!!!!!!!! The defective color has some parts that are darker then others around the waist seam. Unhappy with this purchase.",0
1,"I have a small frame, I’m 5’4” 106 Lbs and the sleeves didn’t reach my wrist, couldn’t even zip it up, I’m a 32C breast. Had to return, the material was whatever so I didn’t even up a size, just went with something else.",0
5,"My grandson, age 8, was absolutely positively thrilled with this costume!  He wore it for his 8 year old ‘pirate’ birthday party, but a number of times since. He feels very proud and important when he is Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />I also purchased a sword, boot covers, but most importantly, the Jack Sparrow hat with attached wig. It really completed the costume. He didn’t care for the boot covers, and the (admittedly cheap) sword, but definitely buy the costume and hat. Great quality, thrilled grandson 😊",1
5,Fit perfect.  Soft a fuzzy.  Good looking coat,1
1,Stretched out after 1 wear. Waste of money.,0
5,Great fit for kids! My 1st grader is 4’6” at 51lbs she wears 7/8 close and this fits her perfect.,1
3,"Received watch 1 as promised. It lost 20 minutes the first week. Seller responded referring to &#34;chains&#34;. I replied that I was writing about watch that didn't keep accurate time. Seller replied requesting picture to verify that wrong model was received. I sent picture. Seller sent reply about &#34;wood&#34; somethings. I requested replacement or refund for watch that doesn't keep accurate time again. Seller agreed and sent replacement that works fine. Price was good. Watch is thin and nice looking as described. Lucky I ordered watch well before my husband's birthday. If you have time, patience and like bargains this seller is right for you.",0
1,"did not like the print, fabric",0
1,Came with a broken necklace,0
3,It's a nice shirt but does not fit like in the picture. The straps go a little funky the cross straps indicate they are the back. I did get confused lol had to check the picture to make sure which side was the back.,0
5,This was for my bridesmaids and it looks so great for bohemian style!,1
1,"They are smaller than I thought and flimsy.  I lost one the first time I wore them.  The back just fell off and since I was at the grocery store, I never found it.  I didn’t notice it was gone until I was leaving.  If these were bigger and sturdier, they would be better.",0
3,"Being a plus sized girl as I am, I was excited to receive the dress in the mail. However the x-large barely fit my rib cage. I'm usually a 16-18 but it barely fit. Also the zipper is thin with the fabric and at first I thought it was going to break when I was trying to zip myself into it. It only went up half my back before I had help. So if you are looking for a dress for a large rib cage or just plus size in general, this x-large will barely fit. But if your smaller it will be a great dress for the price. :)",0
5,Love it,1
2,The ring itself is really pretty but it broke after wearing it for about 2 days. Typical poorly made belly button ring.,0
5,I love it and it soft I bought it for myself,1
1,My son was so excited about getting this mask.  When he opened the package the mask was cracked and bent. It was shipped in a polymailer envelope it's a super thin plastic mask it should have been sent in a box to prevent it from breaking.,0
1,"I purchased the correct size. Shoes were a size too small and cheaply made. This is one item Amazon could drop.<br />DONT BUY, KEEP LOOKING",0
5,"these are the perfect little bootie! the fit is great and they are comfy. it is weird that the zipper is on the outside of the boot rather than the inside, but I still love them",1
2,Has ruined all my clothes but I still love it,0
3,"They are pretty comfy, but there doesn’t seem to be much stretch in them. Just make sure you get the right size. I honestly wish I sized up when I got them, but they work. Just pay attention to sizing",0
5,"Super cute, and comfortable! I had a previous one that I ordered that was uncomfortable and didn't last long. This one on the other hand made my idea of maternity navel rings go back to the better side!<br />Will be getting more!",1
3,Cheap looking.,0
4,"Showed up with one arm not attached, or at least not attached correctly because it fell off as I picked them up. Snapped it back in place and they seem fine.<br /><br />Nice, light, polarized glasses. Good value.",1
3,Not for TRI's. Great for cycling however don't try and run in them. Definitely going to get sag and burns...,0
1,"Noone contacted me when i tried to ask for either a refund or a bigger size, great shoes, bad helping. Buy a size bigger then what you think. i got a size 11 but it was to small for him. Get it right the first time or your money will be wasted.",0
5,Very comfortable. Sof,1
5,Super quality for the price,1
5,"I love this! I did have to change the chain, because stuff like this turns my skin green. That's my problem/preference and not the product's fault.",1
3,"Really liked look and feel of vest on arrival. Unfortunately, when I put on, I dsicovered the main front zipper was 'reversed.' By that, I mean the zipper pull was on the left like a traditional female garment. I contacted the company and was told they had a 'batch' mistakenly made in the 'European' style. I have no idea how large a batch is or how long before you get one with a traditional style zipper. It may not be an issue to you but I wouldn't have bought had I known so wanted to share. Otherwise seems like a nice vest but I personally don't want to adapt every time I put on so will be returning.",0
5,Give it to a friend as a gift. She loved it!,1
1,"I got the pink ones, they came in kind of flat and not ball-like.",0
3,Some of the prints were blurry,0
5,Love this watch. Can't go wrong with this product,1
5,Very beautiful tie. Great quality!!!!,1
5,Super cute and a great price was exactly what I was looking for very comfortable. I'm 5'6 wear a size 8 pants and a large fit perfect and has stretch too.,1
5,Love this watch. Lots of compliments,1
3,I loved the way these fit. They were super cool and held in all the right places. What I could not get used to was the lack of an opening in the front. It was a drag to have to undress every time I went to the bathroom.,0
5,I can wear this bracelet 24/7 without any problem.  In the sun it sparkles like diamonds.  Glad I made this prchase.,1
3,These socks are really cute and warm. They have a weird seam though so you have to fold the top of the sock down.,0
1,The nose lit up exactly one time before dying. Very disappointing!,0
5,"I received the watch today and couldn't be happier.<br />I purchased this as a gift and it will be perfect.  No one will ever have another watch exactly like this one.<br />I got the Sqwatch and it is a beautiful black with the wood grain showing through.  This can be worn for both casual and business occasions.<br /><br />Besides looking good and being a quality watch, I like principles of this company. Visit their website at [...]<br /><br />I now want an original for myself.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  This discount had no influence on my honest opinion.  If I give a good review it is because I really like the product.<br />I very seldom give a five star rating, however I really like this watch.",1
1,Like the style but not the material... I ordered a blue and from what I'm seeing it's straighLike the style but not the material... I ordered a blue and from what I'm seeing it's straight jet black. Not satisfied at all.  I really needed the blue :(,0
1,"I wore this shirt a few times. It was a little tight for a large.  A hole appeared at the seams of one armpit.  The width of the fabric forming the seam was not wide enough and getting narrower toward the hole that formed. The width of the seam at the failure is 3 mm for two of the seams, the central and right of the 'T' that the 3 seams form.  The width of the two other seams away from the T are 5 mm.  The intact armpit on the other side has a long thread hanging loose about one inch away from the T.  I would not want to replace it as the design or fabrication seems questionable and does not look as reliable my other similar shirts.",0
1,It is not a flowy dress as pictured. Very heavy bulky material and not flattering. Looked like I was wearing a sack,0
2,"Washed a few times, lost its shape and faded.",0
3,Slightly loose in the top and waist area,0
5,Perfect costume for the Live Encanto Sing along Concert,1
1,It was a little small,0
1,"There was a lot of extra material in the crotch area. If you have a super long torso, it would probably fit true to size- however if you don’t, it’s going to be too baggy",0
4,"Ordered up with a large (I am s/m, 5'4 and B cup) and it fit just right. I like this shirt, however, the Ivory color is SHEER..making one's bra visible. I hate this and will not order more colors due to unknown sheerness in other colors. Good quality shirt but not a practical winter shirt.",1
3,Awesome quality shoe trees! But sadly they were much to big for my shoes. I bought these for a pair of Allen Edmonds Rogue size 8.5. I ordered the 41/42 which should have matched perfectly. These however were substantially to large. I was able to get them into the shoes but they were fully compressed and very difficult to get in and out.<br /><br />Maybe the title is right on these and they are shoe supposed to shoe stretchers? The details clearly state NOT for stretching so...I don't know.<br /><br />Either way these are really good quality so maybe just order a size smaller.,0
2,It was thinner than expected and a lot smaller in size.,0
2,después de un uso las telas comenzaron a ceder y se empezó a deshilachar,0
1,Runs very very small,0
5,"I'm 5'8"" 225 lbs ordered a large and they fit really good . They are just a little bigger than I want but they feel amazing! The ruching on the butt doesn't do too much but if it was a med I think it would have fit better. Definitely recommend",1
2,"Its nice when you first get it, but after about 4 days, the lock on the back had broken and a few days following the chain had broke, but the chain was fix able, and the lock still makes it useable. Its also kinda awkward, for me due to the fact it had folded up awkwardly and didn't fall right on my collar bone/ neck.",0
5,This bracelet is beautiful and I like that it doesn't appear to flashy .,1
5,Nice fit / very pretty,1
3,The sleeves are VERY long.,0
1,not recommended for sensitive ears. Hurt my ear very bad and had to basically rip it out to get it out.,0
3,"This is a beautiful bracelet - not so sure about the ""healing"" qualities. The biggest problem is that the blue from the beads came off onto my arm and it took a couple of days to wash it off.  Because of this I am not sure that I will wear it again.",0
4,I love this phone case but it is not quite deep enough to put the magnetic closure over an iPhone 6. I have to put the cellphone in the<br />open slide space on the other side.  It would be good if the case could be made deeper. It's very pretty and nice to carry around<br />instead of a rubber or canvas phone case.,1
5,Love love love! Super comfy and very flattering. Definitely recommend!,1
5,This dress is so cute!! Highly recommend,1
3,Not red it’s orange.,0
5,"Fast delivery and quality product. Looks just as the picture showed, want to buy more colors!",1
2,"Oh man it was huge!!  I purchased the size &#34;L&#34; which is supposed to fit 14-16.  I won't return because of postage cost, but will most likely give it away.",0
4,I love these as the do stay on and hide under my converse but the length is a bit short for my size 8 feet,1
5,Quality shirt. Sizing it accurate and has a nice tapered feel.,1
4,product filled the need and delivery was good,1
5,Looks amazing on.  Easy to put on.,1
5,"LOVED this for a Christmas party. I am 5'4&#34; and 125 lbs and it fit almost perfect. There was a little extra room in the waist, but not too much.",1
5,Great replacement. Use daily.,1
5,Beautiful and good fabric quality. I bought two sizes up after reading the reviews and it went very well.,1
5,This top is so soft and super comfortable. I live it and for a nice lityle workout top its great!,1
5,this mask is great fits perfect and im a small guy only 5 7 and it looks amazing,1
3,"I like how they look, not sure about the fit i want to say they feel loose around the ankles. They are comfortable though.",0
3,"Not very durable, didn’t last",0
1,"Bought these as a party favor for my son’s Nerf battle party. I thought these would be a canvas material but they were a very thin shiny polyester I would say. I don’t think I would use these in a restaurant service situation, and they certainly weren’t right for a kids birthday party.",0
5,It is absolutely beautiful! My daughter loved it! It is eye catching without it being gaudy.  Details on Christ figure are visible.,1
3,The shirt is not the best quality. Multiple seams  are not straight. In general for what I paid I still wear it. Just be prepared for some flaws in the shirt.,0
2,It was good for like a week before the buckle wouldn't clasp into the hole and would keep popping off.  Also this belt was more for aesthetics than function.  My stomach does not burst at the seams.  It was just designed poorly. Don't waste your money.,0
2,"Pictures are misleading. The split actually starts right at the collar, not lower like in the pictures so ALL of your back is exposed. Which is not what I was looking for. Other than that it would have been a great purchase as I like the basic idea but this shirt is just not for me.",0
5,"I wear a 12-14 and ordered an XL based on the size chart. Fits perfectly and is super comfortable.  I bought two pair in different patterns and love them.  Also have washed them (cold water, gentle and line dry) and they are holding up beautifully so far.",1
3,One pair broke at the stud after one wear and I got 2 sets of duplicate earrings. But for the price it will be nice to have this selection,0
5,Great cheap sunnies!! I think they are very cute and I absolutely love that they don’t have the rubber piece on the nose!!,1
1,"I initially liked it, but it hasn't been a week, and one already broke. It has been falling apart since Day 2. Now the net has opened up. I haven't used the second one, so that one is still fine, but I doubt it will last too long.",0
5,Love the fit n the look,1
5,"I LOVE this blouse! I reordered it and have it in 3 colors. I'm 5'8&#34;, 36D, a size 8, and the Large fits like a glove. It's colors are just as pictured. You'll love it too.",1
4,Great for crafting. By itself it’s literally a boring blob. It’s also so big that it fell over my eyes so I glued the front up and added a ribbon and bow. Now I’m happy with it. You could do a lot with it or just use it as a beach hat. Just too big is all. It’s breathable tho.,1
4,"The small hoops are a perfect size and fit snuggly without squeezing the earlobe.  The stainless steel is great since I cannot tolerate nickel that is contained in some silver jewelry.  The bar is somewhat difficult to insert in the hole, but once done, stays securely placed.",1
5,They do their job. Easy to use and haven't had any problems with them. My only advice to people would be don't wear them for more than 2hrs (at least for me)  because they will hurt your ears.,1
3,Very very cheap cracks and falls apart easily. We bought this as a prank ring and it served its purpose but do not buy for a really gift.,0
4,"This is a beautiful little organizer for a backpack with lots of pockets and zippers, but.....this does not fit your standard Loungefly mini-backpack.",1
1,"This umbrell a was a Easter gift for my daughter who is 6.  It did not survive the day.  It looked as though the top rivets were not even connected, so once you unfolded and refolded it, you had all these loose wires going every which way.  Total garbage.  I could not repair it although &#34;repair&#34; is a stretch, more like I could not assemble-what-was-never-properly-assembled-to-begin-with.....",0
5,Grandson loves,1
3,"It came on time, I normally wear a medium but ordered a small, it was still too big, the fabric is too stretchy, i felt like i was wearing a child’s dress. I gave it to a friend.",0
1,"Sizing is Chinese so order 5 sizes larger than normal, do not follow sizing in description. I normally wear a sz18 but the 5xl would barely fit my sz8 sister.  If I had known it was from China, I never would have ordered it.",0
2,"I wanted to love this dress, it’s long , stretchy!!  but the blue dye they used came off all over my nails by just trying it on. . Not so great of quality for the price .",0
2,"The shoes are cute but way to narrow. My son couldnt not even wear them bc it was hurting his foot. I suggest ro go to a sporting good stoe like Dick, the prices are the same.",0
3,"RED SIZE 11 1) I recommend buying a whole size larger.  I usually wear a 10 or 11 depending on the style so I initially purchased size 10.5. I figured that would allow enough length at the toe. It did not. The size 11 that  I exchanged the first size for is long enough.  2) These shoes are a great color, but offer very little support, definitely not a pair for athletic activity or walking around long periods. The size 11 does allow enough room to add arch supports to offset the problem.",0
5,"Its hockey, and socks, can't go wrong",1
2,Originally ordered a  Large and sent it back as it was way to small.  Ordered a XL and I don't think the size changed.  Runs way small order 2sizes up...,0
3,"This dress is not what I was actually expecting looks more like a nurse uniform then a dress,it is too thick and loose and boxy, the size is right.",0
5,Nice and sturdy with plenty of room,1
2,"I love this bra and I wish it had better support. It is like low on my back so there isn’t enough actual boob support. I wear 36 D- 36 DD, needless to say my boobs are heavy. This is misleading because it’s called “medium impact” not sure where that comes from because nowhere on the tag does it say that, I have no idea how that could be possible because it is very light weight and not too tight like some sports bras. Right On the bra itself is a tag that says light support... misleading however I love this bra, material, design. Upsetting.",0
2,"It's a good tie, but I needed navy & pink & this is definitely not navy.....It's purple!",0
1,I wear a medium. This fit like a 4x.  It was way to big,0
2,runs small. im a 36dd and should have ordered a bigger size,0
4,NIce,1
3,"The hat would be a lot nicer if they didn't crunch it into a plastic bag to ship it to me causing awkward creases in it so it won't fit right and looks like I sat on it for a month. It can't even be worn when it arrives because you have to spend forever ironing out the folds they make, reshaping the crushed flower and re shaping the hat to fit properly. Once you go through all that, if you get it to look right you’ll have yourself a decent hat. Why these sellers don’t just use a proper box to ship these is unbelievably ridiculous and cheap of them.",0
1,I wasn't satisfied with this product . It had no support at all.,0
5,So beautiful. Can't wait to give to my sister for Christmas.,1
5,"This mask is durable & breathable. I've hand washed them many times. The fabric is not stretchy, so it's not a tight seal. But the metal noseband inside makes it tight enough, but still allows you to breath. The cotton woven fabric allows more breathability in hot, humid conditions. I just bought a second pack. Hopefully, we won't need them much, if at all, very soon!",1
5,Great wig,1
1,"It's orange, not beige. Pictures don't show you the real color.",0
1,material is not seem to be as describe,0
3,"These earrings are heavier (coarser) than the image showed. DOn't get them if you want something dainty. I just can't wear cuffs, so can't judge as to their worthiness, they seem pretty cheap. Good enough to keep and wear occasionally, but I wouldn't purchase them again.",0
3,Not as shiny as in tbe picture shown,0
2,Very warm in hot weather: doesn’t breath much,0
5,Price is right and fabric is nice.,1
5,I've tried many bands but I love these the most. There are various colors to choose from and they are very comfortable on my wrist. Easy off and on and very durable.,1
1,Run really small,0
5,This piece this very nice,1
1,Returned them. Gems were out in the package and these earrings were very heavy.,0
2,Stopped working after a few days which wasn't all that bad because I saw it more as a bracelet then a time keeping piece. The minutes aren't the clearest to see and the skull design could probably stand out more as it kind of blends in. I don't wear it anymore but it's ok to keep as bracelet if it happens to match what I may be wearing.,0
5,"Amazing, exactly as on the image. This is a great find for the money and I highly recommend it. I had a really hard time finding high waist denim shorts without stretch (that fits). This one doesn't have any stretch so not sure about the other reviews saying otherwise. I'm 5'9"" and 165 pounds, I gained extra 10 punds after having a baby and this was sort of gambling with the size. I ordered size L and it fits perfectly. Denim is nice, great color and of good quality. I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
3,Very nice watch for our daughter. Keeps time well. Only issue is some condensation...even after placing the watch in rice for several days.,0
5,Good quality.,1
2,I have a huge head and face and even I have trouble keeping these up without help. The hemmed ends are nice but the printing is low-quality and the fit is disappointing.,0
1,"This looked great, but started to fall apart the first day I wore it.",0
3,"If you’re looking for comfort, get 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear. That’s what the model is doing.<br />I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear because 1 I’m losing weight fast, and 2 as a fashion statement.<br />It’s a nice jacket, the sleeves are that material that almost all winter sweaters have but it’s not as hard as Walmart winter sweaters, more like expensive Target sleeve winter sweater.",0
1,"Terrible fakes, gave one start only because I had to..",0
5,Good product for both sexes.,1
5,as we expected! tks,1
3,"This earring is super cute. However, it’s listed as being a 16G and is most definitely an 18G. I wanted it for my daith but since it’s so small and I don’t want to go down a size to later have to gauge it l, I found another ear hole to try it out in instead :(",0
5,Love them,1
4,Really completed my outfit. I liked it,1
3,"This worked for spirit week for elementary school, but not best quality. If you just need something simple it works though.",0
5,Soft and cute,1
5,I really like this top!  Fits great and very comfortable!  Great buy.,1
5,"This thing is brilliant!  I seriously can't believe that somebody didn't come up with this before.  I am a SCUBA diver, and as soon as I saw this I knew I had to have one.  And fortunately I got a nice discount in exchange for my honest review.  I had an instant flashback of my last beach dive:  Getting out of the water with a wet suit on and then having no place to change has me trying to be a contortionist while struggling to get out of a wet suit in the car while getting the seat wet in the process.  Or, the other option is to drag my stuff across the beach or parking lot (while dripping wet and cold) to somewhere private or the public bathroom if you are lucky enough to have them be open at the time.  This towel robe thing ends all that.  Just unzip the top half of the wetsuit and throw the towel robe over your head, then comfortably drop your suit right where you are.  It's like having a portable changing room made out of a towel.  I will never go on another scuba trip without this thing, it makes it SO easy to change and stay warm when drying off.  Then, just slip on your regular clothes underneath and head straight to the pub!<br />The material is like a soft bath towel, very absorbent, not too heavy and yet thick enough to be warm and cozy.  It's like a cross between a nice beach towel and a robe; I'd say it is the perfect material.<br />PROS:<br />* Very absorbent<br />* Nice quality material<br />* Super comfortable<br />* Large size with enough room inside to change (I'm 6' tall and it hangs 4&#34; below my knees; my wife in photo here is 5' 7&#34;)<br />* Doubles as a regular towel, 2 in 1 use is ideal for trips<br />* Great for the beach, lake, surfing, SCUBA diving, or even at the hotel pool in Vegas!<br />CONS:<br />* This thing is so cool that my wife stole mine, so if you're married you'll probably need to order 2.<br /><br />While I intended for this to be permanently part of my Scuba gear bag, my wife promptly snagged this and claimed it for herself!  She loves how soft it is, and has this annoying habit of going straight from the shower to the bed without totally drying off - Now she puts this on after her shower and likes to sleep in it too.  Now I have to buy a second one!  And this time, I'm hiding it so it doesn't get hijacked again!",1
1,😪,0
1,Don’t work,0
5,Runs small but very cute prints. Love for my yoga practice,1
4,I received this ring on time and as the picture its a great fit and very comfortable looking forward to showing it off at work I will be looking forward to see what else this company has to offer!!!!!!!!!!,1
5,"OMG, OMG, OMG - This bag is stunning!!!  It is very well-made. Very unique red rose,roomy and very high quality real leather with lots of organization,one back zipper pocket, zip close middle pocket, two open pockets and a zipper pocket.I absolute!ly LOVE items that are unique and this purse is just like picture, actually even better than in picture. Definitely a statement bag! This comes very well packaged in a dust bag and wrapped in plastic. It arrived super fast by Amazon Prime. I bought this for my sister (and a different bag for myself). I'm so excited and cannot wait to giver her this beautiful purse. I highly recommend Aphison bags!",1
5,"These pasties come stacked in a cute little container to keep them all in one place or for you to grab if you happen to (oops) loose one. Luckily, the adhesive on these pasties are quite secure so if you lost it, you probably weren't wearing it at the time. It's the perfect size and thickness for that natural look that curves to your body that look great for the slinkiest blouses. I especially like how they have extra nipple coverage so you can feel extra confident if they pump up the air conditioning. I live in tropical climate so I wear these quite often because we all know that most of the cute tops & dresses are not bra friendly! So happy that it comes in a pack of four for the price and quality.",1
3,This shirt is not very well made. Is kind of awkward to wear and put on. Size was a bit large. If I bought this again I would buy a size smaller. I purchased a M and I am 5'4 and weigh 135lbs with a 36in bust.,0
4,"I purchased this for Opening Day at the Del Mar races. It looks great with my dress. It's a great size, too. I like that the little lace veil can be pushed forward for more coverage over the right eye, or pushed back so that it's just integrated with the design. Be aware that the hat is designed to be a fascinator on the right side of the head -- in the picture it looks like the left. Not a big deal, but something to note!",1
5,Excellent band style that allows for any desired tightness.  And the magnet grips the band tight so it stays. Only quibble is I wish this was available in black.,1
1,"Where are the teeth, where are the horns, everything is wrong. The picture is misleading, the thing doesn't look at all like the picture.",0
4,"Looks cute, both of them I got opened from the bottom. I wish one of them would at least open from the front so it's easier to put it in your ear.",1
3,I ordered ‘jade green’ color. But received color jade or like blue.,0
2,Cheap and very short....didn't fit st allQQ,0
4,"I received this product quicker than it stated. The costume itself is a bit thin (just like th company Paper Magic, it is paper thin), but it's really cute. Just try not to pull and tug too much. The only downfall is that the title states it's a XXL but when the package arrived it was an XL. Luckily it fit. I typically wear an Xl, but I ordered it a size big to have extra room to move. Make sure you double check the size with the company, because even still in my order history, it states that it is and XXL. I would recommend this costume.",1
5,The most comfortable dress! I got it in blue too!,1
1,Product received is Not like the photo. Just looks like an oversized piece of fabric. I ended up making 2 large head wraps from the product.  I don’t recommend.,0
3,I gave it to my sister.  It was way too small for me and I was really looking forward to wearing it is so flattering.it fits my sister fine.  She is a size 12.,0
5,"I am allergic to so many different things, but titanium is one thing I am not allergic to. Also, I do not think I am allergic to leather. It came with the bars, which was awesome.<br /><br />The price is kindof high on this, I personally think, but it was well made, and I am wearing it 24/7 so I am hoping it will last. Thanks for making this!",1
5,"Fantastic, love these things!!!!",1
5,"Really like the fit and feel, will be ordering a couple more pairs in different colors.",1
3,"Inexpensive and mostly reliable. Case material appears to be of poor quality. Runs very fast, + 1 minute per day. Their Amphibia model is far superior, but double the price.",0
5,"Better than expected for the price. Looks to be well made, the watchstrap is soft and appears durable.  Well packaged.  Overall rather pleased with the purchase. My only negative observation is that it did not come with the little plastic piece that prevents the battery from draining ... otherwise it's two thumbs up.",1
5,"Great umbrella, reasonable price",1
4,This dress is beautiful and comfortable. It fits as expected giving a bit of compliment to the bust and waist area because of it's design. My only issue is it's a bit of a lint collector so make sure you have a lint brush handy.,1
2,"I'm 5'2"", and 112 pounds, and as much as I wanted it to fit, it was just too loose. The hubby took a look and said 'uh uh' while shaking his head vigorously back and forth. Unfortunate, it's too cute.",0
2,It's a really small top. I wore it but was really tight for XL. Using XL is really baggy the fit was quite tight.,0
5,"Comfortable, good quality",1
3,I was disappointed it isn’t a cotton feel. Slick and polyester feeling.,0
5,The colors and image on this hat is beyond me. I did not think it would be so crisp and bright. My husband loved it!,1
1,I'm returning the item to tight cutting off my circulation.,0
1,"these suck , soooo thin , thinner then a piece of paper , and no push putton drawtring .<br />know wonder there the cheapest on here",0
5,Great item holds the glasses very well.,1
3,The glasses fit my 7 year old pretty well. He uses them for baseball.  They just don't work underneath a batting helmet or a catchers helmet due to the arms of the glasses sticking out.  They work underneath a ball cap just fine.,0
5,"This bag was perfect! Held my entire long wallet, phone, keys, lipgloss, hand sanitizer and tissues for an NFL game. I love that I can be hands free and not weighed down in pockets. Breezed through security showing them front and back. Would recommend and buy again.",1
1,Packaging of the item was horrible. Used a gigantic box to pack three small filters and one of them was already open! Very disappointed.,0
1,"I’d give this 0 stars if I could. Came crumpled in the bottom of a bag, deodorant stains in the armpits & reeking of perfume (almost gagged when I opened the bag). Immediately returned.",0
5,"great for a dday bag or an overnite bag, sturdy, greaaat quality",1
5,absolutely love it.  Keeps perfect time and a nice looking watch on the wrist. durable with a classy look to it.  only minor complaint is that I wish the date window had a maginfyer on the crystal.  its hard to read.,1
5,Great sunglasses for a great price. Win/win!,1
3,more purple than grey,0
5,"Two big plusses from Minnesota for these clip-ons.  1) They are great for driving when there is snow.  They not only cut the glare well, but improve snow contour visibility--so you can discern subtle changes in snow on and beside roads and parking lots.  2) If you keep them in the car, they don't fog as much as straight sunglasses when you first get in a cold car.  So far they have also resisted scratches and smudging.  Would buy again,",1
1,They were defected. I threw them away as soon as I was finished with my walk. Only reason I wore them was because it was all I had,0
3,"This necklace is a glass dome with a photo inside, not gears. It is fine, but not what I thought I was getting.",0
5,Beautiful!  Just like the picture.,1
3,The little piece in the middle pops out easily. Pointless to have it. Doesn’t change their effectiveness but kind of looks dumb.,0
5,Running shorts,1
5,"Very nice, so far so good. I received compliments and look forward to using it often.",1
5,Got it as a gift for a cat lover. She said it was purrrfect.,1
1,These literally fell apart my first time using them. Honestly just laughed at how cheap they are.,0
5,Love it!! Fits perfectly and goes on easy,1
5,"Exactly what I expected. Great style. I don't actually wear glasses (prescription) so I just wear them for the look. Not too much protection from the sun tho, so I suggest not looking up 😂",1
3,feel good fit good but after used for a week starting fogging,0
2,"Always thought I had average size ears but this product is too short (?) to reach the top of my ear, once inserted into my earlobe.<br /><br />And, shipping took forever!",0
3,The shirt was advertised as a sweatshirt. It does not have the fleece inside the shirt like most sweatshirts do. The size was accurate and the pattern was spot on. Just not what I expected as a sweatshirt.,0
5,Love them !,1
4,"I was looking for an easy way to keep track of my keys when I don't carry a purse. I received the item quickly,  and it's exactly what I needed.",1
1,Hat was too small,0
5,"Fantastic watch, sure deserves 5 stars.<br />I love watches, this is my first unkown brand I had, I love issot, swatch, ck, certaina. Which they are more expensive (except swatch) this watch is not different than all of them.<br />The most thing I like is the finishing, it looks much more expensive than it is. The strap can be better, but still deserves 5 stars.",1
2,The fabric of this dress is dreadful,0
1,Color is slightly off still nice. The main disappointment is that it was folded into fourths damaging the brim and leaving creases that are so awful that no amount of shaping will fix it. The hat is adorable but completely unwearable!,0
4,"Very nice jacket. Only problem - I ordered gray, but I received a blue jacket. Unfortunately this is not the color we wanted. However, as far as the jacket itself goes, the thickness is nice and the jacket feels soft and comfortable. It is not traditional fleece. It has a thicker weave of some kind. Overall, it is a lovely jacket, just not the color we ordered.",1
4,"These are really cheap in price, so don’t have high expectations. They are very light, comfortable, reasonably stylish and do the job. The extended nose pads are a bit larger than on my older glasses, so they are more comfortable, and they are adjustable. The glasses may not sit perfectly straight or have perfect lenses, but that’s OK. I now have enough readers throughout my house and am glad to have them.",1
2,"Very streatchy, not compression like at all.",0
2,These are hard to adjust and really big not suitable for super small fingers,0
2,The small ball earrings are a very opaque (dark) silver compare to picture and other fashion earrings included in package.,0
5,"I loved 2 pins in this set and the price was cheaper than buying two separate pins, so I bough the whole set. Accurate description. Fast shipping. Good quality. Great message. Pins held up well wearing them a month straight on my work badge. I did however have locked backings(from Disneyland) on my pins. I’m not sure how the ones that came with it would hold up. I’ve lost too many pins(not this set) to regular backings. I love the price and the message and would buy again if they offer other sets. I totally recommend this set of pins and also locked backings for anyone who wears pins on a regular basis.",1
5,The socks didn't slide down my leg.... I recommend these socks.,1
5,Great shirt,1
5,Perfect for a first Easter bonnet.  Thanks,1
5,Got the size '4' for my 2 year old boy.  They are a little large now but he wears them and will grow into them.  They are super easy to put on and take off due to the large Velcro opening and are great protection to have for little hands learning to ride bikes!,1
5,Kind of thin and short but still worked out perfect for my daughter’s birthday party!!,1
3,Product concept is interesting. Essentially attaches to your head and presses against your head to flatten the hair on your sides. The instructions suggest leaving it on for 10 minutes. I do notice a mild difference in the poofiness of my hair on the sides but don't expect anything too magical. Product seems way overpriced for what it is but somewhat understandable as it seems to be an import product. You could probably get similar/better results using a headband but it would lack the cut outs for your ears and extended part for your sideburns. Wouldn't recommend the product to everyone but worth a try for those who are frustrated with the spikiness of their under hair. One noteworthy thing is that since the material is perforated it is possible to blow dry it to heat it up which helps more with keeping the hair underneath flat.,0
5,I love the classic 80s vibe of a good Casio watch and the low price point can’t be beat! Easily a great “wear it and wreck it watch” for when I’m out working.,1
3,I usually what a Lg (10-12) and this top in a 12 was like wearing a tent.  It has a lot of pleating in the back.  The khaki is a nice &#34;dressy&#34; color and the material was not too sheer.  I may try a smaller size.,0
3,"Like the color of the shirts and the size , I just have to say I should have went larger  going by the description I have to say not completely sure. 😍😯🙄",0
3,"Somewhat big, but otherwise fine.",0
1,The material is thinner than my 10 year old pajamas. It is also an international vendor so it has to be picked up at the post office.,0
5,Absolutely beautiful dress. Fits very nicely and of good quality.,1
5,Perfect skirt for the fall. Fit is snug so be sure of your size.,1
1,"Super cheap, thin and surprisingly sticky but not to my legs. It sticks to each other. Wore them for 3 hours and tore a whole in the toe. 1/10, wouldn’t recommend",0
5,"I usually wear a medium, ordered an XL = fit great. Will prob order a L next time for more of a compression fit.",1
1,"This thing is tiny. It will work for toddler clothes. My daughter is 8 and just one costume wouldn’t fit in here, and it’s short. Not what I was expecting.",0
5,fit perfectly!  loved this item,1
1,This is a great concept unfortunately it's painfully executed literally. The spring creates a painful pressure point wherever you place these. And the metal is so cheap it bends at the slightest adjustment when putting it in. I would not recommend this for more than a few minutes of wear.,0
3,"This is another dress that suffers from vanity sizing. Rather than being completely honest about sizing, so that women can find what they need, they slightly change the numbers. She said it was larger than it should be, at this size, with the labeled measurements. They got the measurements wrong by a couple of inches, so the dress is a little loose on her. Additionally, it isn't a wrap dress, at all. I have no idea why they would call this a wrap dress. It is a pull-on dress, that you pull on over your head. It doesn't wrap, so you can't adjust the size to be larger or smaller, as you can with a wrap dress. Consequently, she is the only person who can wear this dress. She can't share it, and we all love to share clothing. The fabric is not stretchy, so, it is also not a shrinkable fabric, moving with the body. As a result, it sort of hangs there, off of the body. If you get one that is the perfect size, it will look very nice. However, if it is too loose, it will look a bit cheap. I am tailoring this for her, so it will look nice. Overall, it is a nice dress, but it is not a wrap dress and the sizing is a little off, so I took off two stars.",0
5,Absolutely striking.  Love the matching pocket square.,1
1,"Disappointed since the color started to wear off, with just one time worn.",0
5,"These socks are great: all cotton (hard to find), soft, light thickness but strong.  A great find, especially at the low price!",1
5,Great assortment.,1
5,"It's so cute, great quality!",1
3,"The neck is too small for the look they want. the fabric is a little itchy. it looks ok though, but nothing special about it. still, it is confy and I use it at home.",0
4,"I probably needed a sixe XS, which they don't have, but this is a super cute choice! I just wish mine fit and I didn't have to return. Good quality and super comfortable material.",1
3,Runs small,0
5,Great value. 200 miles in and still going strong.,1
2,"Very upset.<br />This dress is not as pictured. It's got the shiny wine colored taffeta and pretty lace overlay, but the skirt is NOWHERE near as full as pictured, which is what would give it the vintage feel I was looking for. Useless for what I needed it for. Very upset as this was for a special occasion and an authentic vintage look is required. I am attaching a photo to show the difference. The stock image shows a full skirt, the skirt is not full at all.",0
5,"Excellent fit on my Seamaster and the color matches the green in the dial very well.  Band has a good feel and fits nicely on my wrist, which is typically a 7.25”. The band also has two tabs that hold the first band loop in place near the buckle.",1
5,I bought matching pairs for my husband and I and I can't wait to wear them. They are the perfect summer sneaker I was looking for. I usually wear between 9-9/5 women's so I went with the 9 or 7men and it was a good move. I also got my husband a half size smaller and he said they fit good too. Im in love with my chucks!,1
1,Size is stated as five by five and a half but it is smaller than that.  Passport can be put in it by stretching the material but there is little room for anything else.  You have to put the narrow side of the passport in first and then twist the passport around to get it in the leg wallet.  The second pocket is so small as to be almost unusable for anything but a key or a small amount of rolled up cash.  For me it was just tooooo small.,0
3,"These are very pretty but extremely large, too large for me.",0
2,it stunk so bad it took 2 days of spraying and soaking in vinegar to get rid of the musty odor. seems fine now,0
3,"Pretty dress, just didn't fit right so I had to return it.",0
4,This was a surprisingly good suit for the money! I bought this for a last minute trip and it was really cute. I'm 5'4&#34; 130lbs and the medium fit fine. Only issue is the grey middle fabric was a little baggy but well worth the $20,1
5,I’m an adult I wear a 7 in women’s. I ordered a 6 and they fit perfectly,1
1,ordered sizes 8 and 12.  As you can see in picture both are the exact Same size but labeled 8 and 12!  Also the colors are way off each other!,0
5,"I LOVE this cardigan. Over the years, I've been buying them at Target and the price has gradually increased, for sweaters of the same quality. I usually wear 6-8, the medium fits perfectly. It is thick material (not too warm, I wear it in my chilly office most of the day) but not thin, cheap material either. This is the only cardigan I'll buy again, can't wait to get more in different colors.",1
1,0 just for the price ring looks super super cheap lmao,0
1,"These glasses are pretty dark, but since they are so flat, they let in a lot of light from the back and sides which then reflect off the inside of the glasses.  This causes a glare that you never really get used to.  Also, I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but the picture shows (2) sunglasses.  Most of the &#34;Dark OG&#34; sunglasses come in a pack of two for about the same price.  When they arrived I thought I was short changed, but I realized I was tricked by the picture.  As I was writing this, I went from a 3-star, to a 2-star, and now down to a 1-star.  I wont be buying these again.",0
2,"This to is not long at all!  The length stopped at my waist and order an X-large, not wrinkle free by no means.",0
5,"Brought this shirt for my son, it fit perfectly. He looked so handsome wearing his VLone",1
2,I got this for a Christmas present for my daughter who loves h2o and I was very disappointed. If you look at the pictures you can tell how cheep the stone is and how one side has been painted out so light can't pass threw it. I just expected a little more for official licensed merchandise.  I feel like if I would have grabbed a blue stone and wrapped it in a leather cord I could have made something better looking and I have zero jewelry making skills.,0
5,"as comfy as everyone says, if I were more daring id wear them all the time. but I'm not that bold",1
5,"Pockets are a little to forward and center compared to what I used to but everything else, imo is really very great! 👍 I’m a big guy and this leaves me some space so I am super happy.",1
4,Loved this little top and appreciated the V cutout in the center to show off a little stomach.  Gave the illusion of being thinner.  It ran a bit too tight for me through the chest / arm area so I opted to go up a size.,1
5,"I sent this to a BFF to perk her up, and she loves it. She hasn't taken it off except for showers. I am thrilled.",1
5,"Good quality, color true to pic.",1
3,Tight in the armpits and super long. Bought the size I would normally wear based on measurements and should have bought a size or two up. Super cute and realistic though!,0
3,"These do the job for a cheap pair of sunglassses.  They are a little wide, so you won't win any beauty pageants, but if you're just looking for something to block out the sun these will get the job done.  They're also surprisingly comfortable for something so cheap, and manage to stay relatively fog-free in athletic conditions.",0
4,Great,1
5,The mask is durable. Its been washed countless times and is still in perfect condition. I like that I can add a filter to it. My son was so excited to wear these he loves the designs :),1
3,"I loved the color, size and price , but the rock keeps falling off the metal ring. It needs to be attached more securely.",0
4,It was actually very beautiful n super sexy. However I am a curvy woman with a nice size butt so shorts where snug. Would definitely buy but up size.<br />I'm 5'2 145 lbd n I think it was a medium I ordered,1
1,very glamrous but startwd losing beads on first wearing,0
5,Well made Beautiful worth every penny.,1
3,I normally order a medium but I wanted this to fit a bit snug so I ordered a small. The small was insanely large. I thought maybe I was just sent the wrong size on accident but the tag had an S. Definitely size down.,0
3,beat up and out of shape.,0
1,The package just came and it's missing a stone. super disappointed,0
1,The hat is cute.  But it was all folded up in a mailing envelope. I have been steaming it to get its shape back. That's why I gave it 1 star.<br />.,0
1,"This is the very worst thing I have ever obtained;there is absolutely no for this eyeglasses strap;it rips apart,with little or not stretching or pulling and there is literally no way to use it!!!!",0
5,Pretty happy with the size of these. Haven't used them but they look cute.,1
5,Took it to the Bahamas and stayed healthy and happy!!,1
4,"Finally got it today!! Wishing it would have been here sooner though. The sleeves could be a little longer, but it fits perfectly!!",1
5,"It is so cute. There is the rubber smell when you open the box, I let it vent a bit in my closet and the smell don't bother me no more.",1
3,It is very beautiful and elegant. it looks like pic but it have a defect the zipper does not work correctly.. :-(,0
1,Demaciado pequeña pedi small y no le  entro a mi hijo deberian ser mas expesificados con las tallas pero buen material,0
5,Great suit! This is a great Gwenom suit! Comfortable and easy to put on/take off. The mask came with it and does fit a little funny around the eyes. Overall great buy. I received many compliments on it at Comic Con and at the movie theatre.,1
1,Threads on the top aren’t correct.. when you try to screw on the top gem it’s threaded backwards....,0
1,"Wasn't real happy with this one. And, gave it away as I didn't feel like sending it back.",0
2,I like these sandals but they don't have enough arch support.,0
5,"This is the first watch band I have bought, that didn't come with my watch. It was very easy to install (I have never tried before and it took me all of a minute to replace). I bought this leather band to switch out with my sports band. I wanted a band which I could wear to professional occasions or on a night out. I am very pleased with how the band fits and feels. It is very comfortable to wear, it does not pinch or slide around. I was very pleased with the easy installation as well. The color is darker than the picture in my opinion, however I was pleased it was darker. The picture makes it look cheap, however I think in person it looks much better and more classy. I will be happy to wear this to dinner tonight and when attending professional functions. It does not feel any different compared to my sport band so I am pleased with that as well. All in all I would recommend purchasing this brand it is much prettier and comfier than expected. I am even considering buying their other colors (I purchased the brown leather band)<br /><br />I received this product in exchanged for an honest review. This review is my honest opinion and is in no way effected by the seller.",1
5,"Exceptional product, great value",1
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could,0
4,It isn't a tight fit watch. It's pretty.,1
3,It's a cute dress but the top light pink part is on the thinner side. You could see my beige bra pretty easily. Returned for that reason.,0
2,"Runs very small, short torso.",0
4,Very soft my granddaughter wool love it.,1
1,Was very interested in this product and really liked it until I was disappointed when the coin itself not the chain broke within 2 days.,0
5,I love this tee. 5'1 118lbs &the medium fits perfect. I was hoping it would be a little looser like a unisex tee shirt so I could've sized up. But I still love it.,1
1,"ITHOUGHT THESE BRAS WOULD WORK FOR ME, BUT AFTER ONE WSEARING A SEAM SPLIT SINCE IT WASN'T SEWN PROEPRLY.",0
1,"Posts are too short, delicate and easily bent.  I've ruined one already trying to get it in my ear.  Loss.  The backs<br />are tiny/itsybitsy/tiny/tiny.  NOT for anyone with arthritis.  This purchase was a disappointment.",0
1,Poor quality didn't even last the night. if i knew it was made out of two headbands stapled to card board and half a package of feathers  glued on I would have made it myself.,0
4,"Beautiful and so stunning that I will wear them on special occasions only.  I was planning to wear them to work, but they are just so spectacular that I wear other earrings that are not so &#34;blingy.&#34;  I would have given them 5 stars, but the backs of the earrings are a bit bent.  Otherwise, I am thrilled with my purchase and would recommend them just for the fact that the stones are beautifully cut and facetted.",1
5,"Replacement watch band feels better than the original band.....softer.  It was not hard to put on my watch, however it should include new spring pins.",1
3,"It's cute and all, but it's not very bustle-y. It's pretty flat. I think the ribbon trim looks nice, however.<br /><br />I've been trying to find something that has the dimension of a bustle, though, and this isn't it--it's really only a bustle in the sense of being only the upper back part of a skirt.",0
5,love it!!!,1
5,Really like this top.  I use it to wear to the gym.  Its loose enough that it doesn't show the belly bulge.,1
2,This shirt is 1-2 size smaller!!! I had to return,0
3,"Personally, I didn't find the yellow tint to be particularly helpful with night driving",0
5,I love this on my granddaughter,1
5,"These are thick,comfortable,and well made.  Perfect for hiking and winter weather.  Did I mention that they’re cute?  I really like these.",1
2,Product is nice but the pictures are so streched out they look crappy,0
3,The pendants are nice. Cute his and hers set. Both chains broke almost immediately so plan on having to get other chains when purchasing this.,0
1,"The price was really good for this, however, it fits a bit on the small size. Also, I washed it per the instructions before I wore it using the Woolite Dark detergent and it still faded.",0
5,"Worked great and had no issues traveling the U.K.  There is an odd odor from the wallet when it arrives, but it wears off after use.",1
2,Runs small.,0
2,"It's a great shirt, but before it was worn I washed it. After washing it I noticed that the letters are starting to lift. I'm afraid to wash it again. Because I fear the letters will start lifting and peeling more.",0
5,"Comfy material, beautiful color and great buy!",1
1,https://www.amazon.com/Beautife/b/ref=w_bl_sl_ap_ap_web_17416418011?ie=UTF8&node=17416418011&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Beautife<br /><br />This sweater is poorly made in CHINA.  I ended up waiting about a month for it and when I received I gave it to goodwill.  It is not worth $5.00.,0
1,I returned this item because a stay on the sides of the bra stuck out.  It was pretty but poor fitting,0
5,Warmest hat I have ever owned!,1
1,I purchased this but will be returning based on its size,0
5,This tank is very comfortable and flattering on my larger chested body. The fabric is perfect for a warm Midwest Summer.,1
2,"Color was totally off, and the elbow part is off as well",0
5,This was the perfect size to carry just the few things I needed into the football game stadium. Zippers and straps all work perfectly.,1
3,Tight and shorter than expected,0
5,I love this charm so much! The necklace gave me dermatitis but I just put the charm on another necklace and it worked fine. Unfortunately the loop at the top broke off after about eight months because it's so thin. Would purchase again.,1
2,Buyer beware. They say they are for baby girl/newborn but unless you have a baby that has an abnormally large head they will NOT fit. Them seem to be good quality but I will not know how they hold up for about a year since they are way to big for my 9 month old.,0
3,It's larger than expected but at the moment I'm pregnant with my second child so it works lol but I won't be able to wear it once the baby is born cause it will be too big. I'm usually a xs or s,0
5,I bought this for my 6 year old son and it is adorable!!! It looks wonderful in his new sports room. The quality is amazing and my son is so excited to have this in his room. I am going to recommend this product to all my friends. I’m so happy with this purchase.,1
1,"Really, really cheaply made.  I also purchased some made by Zhuzhulaoyinshi and they are GORGEOUS (and cost less!).  Search for them on Amazon.",0
5,My son (the 5th) loved getting this for his backpack.  It’s not bulky and low risk of accidentally getting pulled off his backpack.,1
5,"This shirt has a surprisingly modern look and it fits accordingly. It's more Kenneth Cole than Carhartt, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.",1
3,Cheap turned my daughter  green in one wear,0
5,"Fits my 13 yr old granddaughter perfectly, like a glove! She's wearing it to her 8th grade dance. Modest, nice length, not too much skin showing, just her shoulders. It's as beautiful as she is! She'll be wearing a strapless bra with it. She LOVES it because it's modest & beautiful! Thanks AMAZON PRIME!!",1
4,Nice earrings but were too heavy and large for the person they were intended for.  I ended up returning them.,1
2,"it is smaller then it says and there are a lot of little strings sticking out off it to snag,, not gonna last very long if worn.",0
4,Love this product is super cute I want it more colors and to have a tiny bit bigger in the neck part. I didn't realized they are attached,1
2,"Both the chain and letters are pretty thin. Not like the picture, but I guess u get what you pay for.",0
2,"Globe was upside down on the axis, and binocular charm fell off pretty quickly after receiving the product. The chain also broke off ~1week later. Cute in photos, cheap as expected IRL.",0
3,"Expected better quality coming from Germany,I can see the iron on pattern,ironed over other parts of it.. not very happy that I waited this long for something so basic my kid could have done",0
4,Love it,1
4,The material on the bottom feels different that the top which was unexpected but ok<br /><br />Update edit. After 2 washings the bottom black is now gray.  The top is still black,1
3,This product was sold at a convention for i think 20-40 bucks the tail is ok however the ears ruined the look from how freely the hairs want to move and they arent even the right size or shape it come in ssideways where as neko ears are forward like ears should be maybe ill cut it and try rounding the hair and finding out a way to get the ears to be straight,0
3,Cute but too big,0
5,"I love these cute little berets, I've bought several. Fun and just as advertised. They are for children, but I am an adult and they fit me--though snugly, which I like.",1
1,"Quality of fabric is very thin and the fashion 'rip' is too large, no response from the seller on the return. Will never but from this company again",0
5,This was a purchase for my granddaughter. She loves to bake and will enjoy wearing this necklace.,1
1,"Awkward fit.. would be super cute but the back where it is supposed to be stretchy, hangs down and sags. I wanted to like it but it just doesn't fit right. I bought a medium and am 36ddd and it was too big.",0
2,I loved it on the Today show and they said it would work for any body type. I am 5’2” and 135lb. I looked like the good year blimp. It would be adorable on anybody thin.,0
3,"5 stars for shirt, old school fit so size down if you want it tighter - I’m 6 feet and 180, large is perfect. Customer service is reason for 3 stars, original order never came and now trying to get them to not double bill me. These shirts though, are sweet.",0
5,"Really loved this outfit, fit perfectly but I did buy in larger size to be on safe side.<br />Wear this somewhere that has A/C if in the summer, very thick material. I was sweating in the<br />summer trying to wear this.",1
3,I've always worn one of these but this one has an odd fit...really can't put my finger on the problem but it simply doesn't lay the way it should. Quality of the construction is good but the fit is a bit off.,0
3,It looks cheap. Maybe it's ok for the price but I didn't like it or would recommended it. Also I was looking for a &#34;slim&#34; wallet and this one isa bit bulky,0
1,Wrong size.,0
1,The product I received had holes in the lace overlay and crooked hemlines at the top and bottom of the dress. It was unwearable. I purchased the sky blue dress - don’t make the same mistake I did.,0
5,Bought these as a early Father's Day gift for my husband and father In law and they love them! They use it for their work keys and they say it makes it easier for them to use.,1
2,I thought this dress was going to be amazing. It looks so pretty in the pictures and it actually looked really good in person too. It was good quality and heavy material. But the fit was just off somehow. I think the bodice part needs to be more fitted and the waistband needs to be higher maybe? It just was not flattering at all. I got a size S and I usually wear a size 4/6. Yet it somehow made me look fat. I had to return it sadly.,0
3,Flimsy design.,0
5,"I loved them so much, it's the right size for my face as it is not big. The lenses are very comfortable, the frame is so classy and the colors of lenses and frame are so matching together you would love and appreciate them, also customer service are so kind a helpful. I recommend it for round and small faces with a thumbs up!",1
1,The back is broken off one of the earrings,0
2,The eye holes were too close. I could only see out of one side at a time. I had to cut the holes bigger.,0
1,"Not like the photo. Yes, the graphic is similar, but what you get is a washed out screen print. I took a photo of it but it looked similar to what is posted on Amazon and didn’t want to provide a false representation. The photo came out looking as though actual glitter was used. And Nope, it is all in the print. This is so disappointing!",0
1,Returned. Very poor quality.,0
1,Didnt even cover half my Boob ordered my size just way to small.,0
5,So cute. My daughter loves it!,1
1,Crap.,0
5,Love them,1
2,Too big for me and the print wasn’t flatter for me,0
5,these are AWESOME!  i can wear these with my sandals to give them a whole new look!,1
4,"Initially had a really strong chemical smell that took about a week to go away (hence -1 star). So far loving it. I like the little metal feet at the bottom that keeps it from getting worn out. Have gotten compliments from people who notice it's a kitty. Pretty roomy- I can fit a plastic water bottle, phone, wallet and some other items. Seems well made so far.",1
2,"Very thin material, not at all slimming or control type material. Too thin to wear as swim shorts!",0
3,This is such a cute ring but unfortunately very small. I wear a size 7 on my middle finger but I could not even get this ring past my finger knuckle.,0
1,if i could give this a zero i would dress was just badly made your a hair line of a nipple slip,0
1,probably one of the worst items i’ve bought on here? like actually nasty feeling. you know those thin raggedy washcloths at your uncles house that are a brown color and are like 15 years old? that’s actually just this shirt.,0
1,I actually bought this for my 11 yr old who thinks she's the most fashionable kid alive. The mold didn't work. I had to do a lot of bending and shaping without the mold. She actually took chewing gum and stuck it inside and that helped it stay while her achieved her look for a few pictures. Lol,0
4,Love them,1
5,"Although the suit was a bit loose, I would buy it again. So comfortable, long enough for my longish torso, and my husband said it looked good. The colors were a bit dull, but that's okay; I don't need to stand out like a red tomato or a brilliant blue balloon on the beach.",1
1,"Nothing! too long, too big and not soft. Had no idea I would have to pay return shipping fee and re-stocking fee. Will not buy from this seller again!",0
3,It was a gift.,0
5,"So cute, comes in a cute velvet box just like the picture shows. My granddaughter loves it, I would recommend",1
3,This is very soft and fits well. But I really don’t like the knit fabric. It is actually hard to breathe with or talk a lot while wearing this because it sort of gets sucked into your nose when you inhale.<br />Disappointed,0
5,Beautiful designer watch for way less than retail price!,1
1,it broke off the chain the first day i got it.,0
5,I loved this product. It came with a lot of beads and everything I needed. It satisfying to make. Now to test to see how strong it will be. Loved it so far!,1
4,Very nice looks good have received many compliments on them.. Thanks,1
5,"I JUST LOVE CAPTAIN MARVEL!!! HOLY MOLEY! Nice shirt, hope it don't shrink much! SHAZAM!",1
3,it took 4 weeks or more to actually get it but it eventually came i had already returned it by then and they gave me the return and let me keep the shirt they were very kind good customer service but i wouldnt recommend it,0
1,"This was really terrible quality. It smelled like chemicals and the material was so stiff and uncomfortable that son didn’t even want to try it on. I wouldn’t recommend it. (The costume we bought was great, but skip the wig.)",0
3,They are okay for their price but fall apart fairly easily and not as tight as expected. I gave it 3 stars because I got 3 for $20 so the above complaints were to be expected.,0
4,Overall good hat and gloves,1
2,"What can I say. Three washes and they are falling apart. I liked them so much,  I ordered a second pair. Afraid to wear any longer since the stitching is coming off.  Will change my review of seller replaces.",0
5,Awesome!,1
5,"It's a tad long and a tad loose, but it will be super comfy to sleep in!  I cannot believe how soft the material is. I am very happy with this purchase I'm probably going to get one in a couple of more colors. I need something that I wouldn't sweat in, but would still keep me warm and this is like a T-shirt Jersey material. It's great!",1
5,Christmas gift,1
2,look cheap and fall down easily,0
2,Product is labeled a briefcase/messenger bag. It is to small to even hold my tablet and would not work as a briefcase at all.,0
1,Very cheap thin fabric. It also has a lot of lint which ruined a black sweater when I wore the scarf around my neck.,0
3,Great price and look good.  Took so long to receive I forgot I ordered them,0
5,Simple and fun outfit. Love wearing them. Great price too,1
5,Bought this for my dad. He loves it.,1
5,Amazing quality!  I only wish there was an option to convert it to a cross body.,1
4,"I was hesitant to venture into the land of unreviewed product purchasing, but I took the chance. Glad I did! I know it kinda looks like the American flag patched together to make a dress, but it looks lovely in person! The only thing is, it is very long (for reference, I'm 5'7&#34;, ordered a small) and made of soft yet quite thin material, which doesn't really bother me. However, short ladies beware! Unless you want to alter the dress, you'll have a whole lot of extra material gathered on the floor. The hem of this dress is designed to be uneven and the sides are the longest parts of it, which looks so beautiful! The v-neck buttoned style makes up the front of the dress, not the back. I'm small chested (32a), so I have to either knot the shoulder straps or cut and resew them if I don't want the front to hang too low for my taste. I truly think it would look just lovely on a gal with even a slightly bigger chest, so no worries! I really do love and feel beautiful in this dress and can't wait to wear it somewhere. 😊",1
4,Not as small as I thought but still worked great,1
1,"A couple of the gloves had holes in them straight from the package.  The stitching is very poor and in a different shade than the fabric.  Also, the dye in the gloves stained the gel polish on my nails.",0
1,Had 2 of these. Each one stopped working in about 13 to 14 months.,0
1,Muy frágil parese cáscara de huevo !,0
2,"I don't know if mine was defective, but even though it felt very sticky one side would not stay stuck for more than 5 minutes. I wear these types of bras all the time but this was my first time trying this brand and this is the only one I've ever had an issue with. I had to send it back.<br /><br />Update 8/25/16: After Komene saw my review they sent me another bra free of charge, even though I had already returned and been refunded for the other one. The second one works slightly better but still won't stay on all day. Because it's slightly better I increased my review to 2 stars from 1. The case it comes in, however would get a 5 star rating. It's very nice.",0
5,Ordered for my 5 year old son.Fast shipping. Item as described. Measurements are accurate.  Great quality.Will definitely buy again.,1
5,Great fit,1
3,Because the paint come off the one the chain,0
2,"Was too small for my use, sent it back",0
4,"Great product, sturdy frames. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is they just didn't look right on me.",1
1,"The quality was terrible. The images printed on the hoodie are really faded and look bad. The hoodie is a gildan hoodie, so it won’t last long. For the price, you’re basically getting scammed. I don’t recommend this at all.",0
3,"Very odd piece of clothing. It fit everywhere except for where the seam sits under the arm pits. It was too big there. I don't have a lot in the chest area so that may be what it was, I purchased a medium and am usually a medium or small in shirt sizes.",0
4,Really nice material. GOOD QUALITY for price. Nice modest fit.,1
3,"Returned product can't remember why at the moment, probably to large.",0
5,"Well Ladies, let me tell you that these bum around denim shorts are made of THICK denim & will probably last me a life time. So HAPPY about that because I Love them! The extra large pockets are spacious & handy. I was surprised the care instructions said do not tumble dry, don't know why. I threw them in my dryer along with everything else & they came out PERFECT, actually a lot softer with no wrinkles & no shrinkage to detect . Needless to say they are my go to comfy shorts, need to buy another pair they are always in the wash :)",1
5,Very cute! A little big but works great as a coverup!,1
1,"The sleeves are HORRIBLE!!!!! I literally cut the off, and took the dress to the tailor and made it into a one strap dress. The glitter constantly falls off. But again your get what you pay for. Also it arrived 3 weeks after the initial delivery date 0/10 don’t recommend",0
3,DISSAPOINTMENT. I LOVE THIS PRINT. BOTTOMS FIT GREAT XL. BUT THE TOP IS TOO TIGHT.,0
4,"Gloves were great. Kept hands warm. Used gloves for the snow.  The only problem with gloves is that once the gloves get wet, they take a long time to dry.",1
5,"Love it! Perfect fit, easy to clean, and comfortable!",1
3,"Weren’t all that, didn’t think they were worth almost 100 bucks.",0
5,"Very satisfied with the quality of this product, I'm a future customer.",1
5,"Great shirt! I did have to exchange the L for an XL, only because it was too tight across the bust. Even with the XL, I had to put a safety pin between two of the buttons so it wouldn’t gap open. I do usually wear a L shirt, just for reference.<br />But the shirt itself is beautiful, I feel very comfortable in it, and I want to buy one in all the colors offered.",1
5,"Bigger diameter than expected, so I will have to look at how to shorten it. But this is actually very beautiful.<br /><br />I am also curious on the sustainability. I’m a little frustrated in myself for not confirming prior to purchase.",1
1,Wide and looks sloppy,0
4,I like them but they slip off with a slight tug.,1
3,Too small to put on a normal size man’s finger. He will have to have the skinniest fingers ever,0
2,Not the color I thought it was. More of a mustard yellow not light yellow.,0
4,"The material is nice, soft, not too bulky. The waist though is quite snug for sweatpants. It is elasticated but not as roomy as regular sweat pants.",1
1,this XL is about a M can not even sip up.,0
3,Can I please still return this item? It doesn't fit and I have no use for it.,0
4,"I ordered the orange cardigan for fall. The color is bright orange, not a coral or burnt orange. Even though I’m a medium I ordered a size small because I knew a boyfriend fit would run large. The small fits like a typical US size large. This may not be small enough for a size 4 and under, but is good for size 8 and up. It is open so it’s versitile for a wide range of sizes. I gave this to my sister who is pregnant since it’s open she can wear it over anything.",1
2,Not flattering on my daughter and the material was weird,0
5,"hi, really nice shirt, I asked for a medium size and fitted very well, the quality of the cloth, by the price it's regular.<br /><br />anyways, I love it and I'll order more in a few days",1
2,Disappointed in the material and it was too tight in the arms.,0
5,Good,1
5,"This robe is warm, soft, and fits well.",1
5,Last weekend it was -8. These kept me warm while I took care of the horses. The heating elements are in the right place for me. They cover where i had surgery on my thigh so it did not feel the cold at all.,1
5,"I've been wearing THE SAME 18g nose screw in my nose piercing for over 13 years... a white gold screw that when it is in, the crystal actually lies flat against my nose, making it less gaudy which is why I fell in love with it.  (It was hard to find at the time, clearly after being on Amazon I was either looking in the wrong places or they're much more abundant noe haha!) YES, I know it's an actual miracle that I've managed to hold on to the tiny thing for 13 years and every time it was lost it was then found, but I decided it was time to buy some extra surgical steel backups.  And in addition to the 16 PIECE nose strew multi back I found here, I decided to get a hoop too, just to try it out for a once in a while different look when I'm not at work or anywhere conservative (accountant here, *eye roll*) I think it's SO cute! It looks well-made, love that it comes with 2.  The clicker clasping which I am not accustomed to at all is almost seamless and it took a while for me to find where it actually opens up.  I managed to finale it in.  The only issue for me personally is it is a little bit tight in diameter, which I should have known might be the case since my nose piercing is up higher on my nostril than I would say is average, however that it not in any way their fault.. I made an error in my estimating.  I will be buying one in a slightly larger diameter.  A+ from me! I'm saving this seller for future body jewelry purchases! This hoop is super cute, easy for a newbie to put in, seems like a solid quality clasping mechanism, and soo inexpensive!  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND PURCHASING!!!",1
1,I was looking for some black stud earrings that were subtle yet nice. These however are so small that they do not show your wearing earrings. I was very disappointed in them for the money I could have gotten much better stud earrings.,0
5,The kids love them and they work well,1
3,"These earrings have very short posts, meant for children's slender earlobes, not adults' pudgy ones.  The backs screw on and completely cover the posts, such as you would wish for a child or baby with pierced ears.  The quality is fine, but buyer beware.",0
1,"i dont like it,i i did buy size M-L but fits like  XS ,smells like plastic ,i wash 3 times still smells bad.....",0
5,"I paid less than $15 for this dress and I had no expectations.  It fits great, the colors are unique and the material is very soft.",1
2,"Doing this review a little bit late. I bought these sunglasses for my husband. He really liked the glasses at first but the second time he wore them they cracked along the bottom of the frame on the left side when he took them off. Despite the crack, he continued to wear them and the next day when he placed them on the table they broke on the right side in two spots leading to the the bottom of the frame breaking off. He has super glued them back together because he liked them so much but we were a little disappointed they broke so quickly after just taking them off and placing them on a table. Maybe we just got a lemon. He really likes the style, the lightness of the glasses, how comfortable they are and the clearness of the lenses. Just was kinda bummed about the fact we didn't get a very durable pair.",0
5,"I really like it!! I don't think it's super stylish, but it's cute enough and will pack well for my travels. I like it that I'll be able to put my hair up and still wear it unlike other brimmed hats I've had before.",1
3,The wings that came with the costume are not done right the stitching is not done right and the size of the velcro straps are not done right. I have to restitch and super glue the velcro to the wings.,0
1,"Too big for my daughter’s small waist ,otherwise the belts are nice .",0
5,These shoes are great for dancing/Zumba for the price!,1
5,Got this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend who loves wolves and she was very happy with it. She wears it always.,1
1,I don't like at all,0
5,Cute dress but runs small,1
5,I have been looking for a good pair of sunglass readers and finally found these.  The best part was that I could measure the ones I currently had and match the sizes listed online.  THE result was a perfect fit for a reasonable price. I HAD Mauii Jims prescription glasses that broke (THEY COST $500) and these work the same. Great glasses.,1
4,Chain came in knots,1
1,I had to return it. When I tried to close the hard case it nearly snapped my finger off. I’m too scared to use this case!,0
5,"looks exactly as the picture. they shine, they are gorgeous. Additional I received a necklace. happy with the purchase. highly recommend",1
5,The foot holes were sewn a little off but over all they are nice and warm and look adorable.,1
2,Clasp was broke and necklace is flimsy.  Returning,0
1,"If this is a dress, it's the smallest dress ever made. It was extremely short and I couldn't even get it to wrap around my body. Is this a kid's size or a joke? It was two strings on each side, witch I would assume wraps around your body, but no way to attach on inside. It was just weird. Do yourself a favor and just stay away from this.",0
5,Its beautiful! I love it. I have big wrists and fingers and had no problem with it fitting.,1
5,"soft, good quality sweatshirt, graphic is bold but not stiff or plastic-y looking, worth the price. runs slightly small but nothing extreme, would definitely buy again",1
3,"Just not as delicate or crisp as it looks in the photo.  The angle is slightly different, which was okay, but the color is quite yellow.  It also hangs a tad lower than I wanted it to.",0
1,The biggest size is 8 and it's way too small. I have normal size fingers. Very unhappy!,0
5,"Fits great, good quality material, strong drawstring.  The drawstring could be longer but other than that these are very nice short that fit as expected.",1
5,Perfect,1
1,After 5 punches the tool now breaks off the tip of the non tapered end spitting out your collar stay in 2 pieces . short return window so I am now stuck with it. Should have known to just buy a bulk package of collar stays. Don't fall for this gimmicky tool,0
1,"Do not like, was not a formal cocktail dress at all to my taste. Made of stretchy cotton material. Its a very casual dress in my opinion.",0
1,"When I first came across these earrings, I thought they were super cute and funky. So I ordered them. They are way too small!! Not what I was expecting!!! And just my luck I got the, in white and black. Ugh!! Total waste.",0
5,Great uplifting gift,1
5,I think this runs a little small but love it!  Very colorful and warm!,1
5,These were exactly what I was looking forM,1
3,"Honestly, I got my monies worth as it was pretty inexpensive. Very see thru- must wear a slip",0
5,Super cute. Fits well. Nicely made!,1
5,"Beautiful. Definitely as shown. I am a  bit concerned that the salwar material might be a little less ,but I'll be using material for the 'belt' in the salwar. Grey and yellow is a lovely combination.",1
1,There were small black dots on them.,0
1,The necklace doesn't stay put...all 3 chains get tangled up and it looks terrible..,0
2,"I really wanted this to work out im 5'0 220lbs my butt is bigger then my top but for some reason the shorts are huge and the top is like a really tiny bra , would also be better if it was cotten and not swimsuit ish material",0
5,Purchased as a gift for son.  He likes it.  Holds all his cards and he really likes the money strap.,1
3,is ok,0
5,"Not too heavy, not too light, perfect! Sooooo soft!!!",1
1,Size chart is not right. Too small,0
4,Nice boots for my son. They do get dirty really fast in the dirt. But if you live in town that's probably not going to be an issue anyhow.,1
2,To big. More like a 2 XL,0
3,"The earplugs stay in better than traditional earplugs, but they do not cancel enough noise, nor are they very comfortable.",0
1,Not as comfortable as the reviews indicated. Really tight around the thighs. Disappointed.,0
4,"I ordered a large after reading all the other reviews.  It fits just as expected.  I was worried the bottoms were going to be a bit too short since im 5'8"" but they actually came all the way down to my ankles.  Very satisfied for the price.",1
5,used it for halloween and it worked out well,1
4,"I love the look and of the dress, which was true to size. My only complaint is that even though I'm short, it fits like an empire waist. Either way, it's well made, not short so I'm happy.",1
1,If you like the material umbrellas are made of; you'll like this dress.  Total waste of 💰,0
5,It was a bit large but because I bought this for a preteen.  The color of Fluttershy is vibrant and beautiful.  My dd has recieve many complements.,1
5,Good,1
2,"The product is very pretty but extremely large for a microdermal top (regardless of where it’s placed on your body). Unfortunately I have double dermals on my arm and the micro dermal top snagged on EVERYTHING causing my piercing to swell. It also do not sit flushed to you skin. Very pretty but I’d only use it for microdermal piercings located out of reach of anything (I.E. chest, collar bone)",0
1,I liked the design.  However the charm is no longer silver.  It has turned a rusty brown color,0
3,I was really excited to get this bra. I have been wanting a strapless bra that actually works. the cup is a bit big but it can still work. I am not totally in love with color and material.,0
1,The price is great but the clasp is not evenly matched and scratches my neck I will be looking for another chain,0
5,Fragile wire clasp,1
1,chest was way too tight. I wore once and will never wear again.,0
5,"Nice looking and cute.<br />Storage in every comaprtment and also one descent size pocket outside.<br />Perfect size for purses, phones and a book",1
1,This is the other top 🔝 I bought that can't fit me and I still bought a other one bigger then this and it still didn't fit really now I can't buy your clothing again I did really like the materials I am tired of trying to buy your tops that don't fit as the size say 💭 I wear medium  are large and it still is wrong fits,0
1,First Time I wore them they would not stay in place. Kept working their way down my thighs while peddling.,0
5,"Wonderfully soft, well-fitting lounge-around-the-house & pajama outfit. I've gotten nice compliments on it.",1
5,Everything is perfect,1
5,"I loooove this bathing suit! It's so cute and classy looking at the same time! Small is a tad big...but I usually wear XS, so the size small is as expected. The haltered tie will help the suit stay in place anyways. I love that you can wear the suit 3 different ways...it's like getting 3 bathing suits at the price of one. The retro/classy style makes you looks very feminine and flattering at the same time. The suit has some rufflings at the side tummy, so that helps cover any tummy bloats or what not. I loooove this suit, and I can't wear to wear it!",1
5,Beautiful classy watch,1
4,"The knit is a bit cheap.  It is smooth and medium weight, but not at all as dressy as is the design.  I am going to cut it shorter and wear as a tunic for a performance costume instead of as a cocktail dress.",1
5,I like . It looks great with my vest for party's.,1
5,"This dress is awesome!  I teach 7th grade and was channeling my not-so-inner Mrs Frizzle.  I am 6’ tall, 44DD, 36-ish waist and it fits fine.  It has a bit of stretch to it and the arms fit!  I have farmer arms/shoulders and finding a dress that fits can be challenging, this one has pockets to!",1
4,I love this dress. The shape is flattering; this is so comfortable. You can extend the wearing into fall by adding leggings & a cardigan on cooler nights. The colors are bright - compliments my summer tan well.It have shallow pockets would have preferred a little more depth.,1
3,"THE SOCKS ARE WELL MADE, BUT THINNER THAN EXPECTED.",0
4,Great quality suit for the price!,1
3,ok,0
3,Not the best fit.... but just kept it.... is right around the thigh meets ur part area and a little loose on top. A little weird for me. Wish I would've liked it,0
2,It doesn't fit my needs.  I need one that also holds a passport.,0
5,"My son loved this for his birthday. He wanted to have a more professional, sturdy yet functional briefcase as opposed to a backpack.",1
2,Beads did not fit my waist. I have tons of waist beads.....these were pretty but extremely delicate.,0
4,works great!,1
1,I just brought this luggage on it’s first flight. It cracked in 2 places and the zipper broke. The luggage my fiancé and parents brought had no damage. This luggage is not durable at all! Very disappointed. How do I get ahold of the sellers to fix this?!,0
4,"It is a very good wallet, light and thin, and it is earth friendly.  One thing, i wish there could be 1-2 more place for cards.",1
5,Cute and soft. Expensive. But decent.,1
5,"I normally would purchase an XL in Jrs sizes,which i did originally then returned and  decided on an XXL instead. I'm glad i did, it's so comfortable. it did shrink a little in the wash so keep that in mind when purchasing. Overall nice sweatshirt roomy, comfy not super thick so easy to wear under coats etc or to wear tees or tanks underneath.<br />Note* air drying drastically reduces the shrinkage.",1
3,"really too large for a tie tack but looks good as a lapel pin.  However, I needed tie tack so was a little disappointed.  Nice depending on what you are using it for.",0
5,"These 3 adorable hello kitty masks arrived and I was so happy. The colors on them are so bright and vibrant and the material is silky smooth. They are a great fit. Fits very comfortably on my big face! hahaha. I love Hello Kitty and most HK masks are for kids but these are a perfect fit for my huge adult face and they have adjustable ear things to make the size you need. Get these, they are super cute.",1
1,Broke after opening it. Stupid. Waste of money,0
1,I did not get this shirt pattern; I got an ugly version of tie die.  The sleeves are not to the elbow like the picture shows.  Very poorly made.  Foreign made so more trouble to mail back then it's worth.,0
5,"it's exactly the bag i was looking for; perfect size, straps that aren't as thin as spaghetti noodles, and the color is amazing! i've only had it for a few days, but it seems to be very well made. i'm very happy with this purchase!",1
5,My  wife loves them.,1
5,"I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday. I was a little nervous, because he has had a history of having trouble with watches. Either they don't fit his wrist right, or his skin gets irritated and he has to stop wearing it. After lots of searching for the perfect design, I settled on this watch by BUREI. I can not tell you how happy I am that I did! The watch came beautifully packaged. I felt like what I was giving him was truly special! My husband has to remove one link, for the watch to fit his wrist correctly, but doi g so was so easy with the tool that is included. After over a month of wear, the watch is perfect. No skin irritation. My husband just loves it! Perfect gift, perfect watch! Thanks BUREI!",1
4,Beautiful top! Lots of compliments!,1
5,"This hat is both pretty and cool!  I bought it as a gift, and I KNOW she will love it.  I do!",1
1,"I love this brand but not this style. The yarn started unraveling & falling off within HOURS of putting them on. Mainly around toe and heel but randomly all over; showing just black fabric underneath. Cute, nice colors but only for one wear then they look trashed. No way they would survive the washing machine. I’ve had other snoozies that wash and wear great but this pair is a bad design/workmanship.",0
4,Very classy looking.,1
5,They are wonderful with all shoes.,1
3,Product ran bigger then expected,0
3,quality could be better,0
4,The mask was a crowd pleaser. Only downfall is the thickness where the battery is. Felt like it weighed my face down so I don’t wear it as often. May just wear it for holidays.,1
4,"On the positive side, this is a very comfortable hat. I like the detachable strap - it’s there when I need it, can be removed when I don’t need it. The brim covers enough of your face to protect you from the sun. It’s great for traveling - you can fold it in your suitcase and it won’t crease.<br /><br />What I didn’t like is the general look of the hat - it’s rather sloppy looking as the material above the brim is folded and unfolded. It’s meant to look that way - gives it a very casual look but to me, looks sloppy.<br /><br />My navy hat was the same shade of blue as what’s shown here.",1
1,"first of all it is VERY small 3/4 the size of a replica (correct sized) one. the square at the bottom was hanging free when in fact it is no supposed to be. the engravings on the key itself are shallow and faint mine look as if i set it on concrete and hit it with a sledge hammer, the &#34;leather&#34; cord is not leather it is cheap stretchy rubber that snapped withing the first 15 minutes of me wearing it DO NOT BUY",0
5,this pant has a great fit. Very soft,1
5,Style,1
5,There perfect!! The style is great! You would think they were made for younger kids to play around in but they actually come across as stylish,1
5,"I got this for my teenage daughter to go with some of her other random mix and match suits and she loves it. It fits her well and she loves plain colors that can be swapped with other suits for a different look! Great quality material, doesn't fade in chlorine either.",1
5,"Nice, good quality I'm satisfied",1
1,Would like to send it back,0
2,Inconsistent texture and sizing.,0
5,"I chose the scarf with the pink background. It's more of alight rose. It makes the sugar skulls stand out beautifully and compliments the colors on the painted skulls. The material is soft, and comfortable against the skin. I definitely would recommend this if you love sugar skulls. It is a light weight scarf, but more than enough to keep cold wind off you ears, or keep you neck warm.",1
4,Order Your size. I usually go up one size because I have wide feet and I'm a 9.5.. I got a 10 and they are a little big. But I still love them!!!,1
5,These are the strongest ones i have fish d,1
5,"This is a pretty skirt that would probably look flattering on any figure because of the way it falls smoothly from the waist (or your widest curve) without hugging anywhere. The fabric has a nice fall and movement. The waist band is comfortable and lies flat under a blouse or sweater. The fabric resists wrinkles, making it nice for anyone who travels. I'm ordering another color.",1
1,This was too small for me as an adult. Would be good gift for a child,0
5,Outstanding product just like it was described,1
5,I am a repeat customer of this company. I have been beyond satisfied with each and every necklace I have purchased. I bought this necklace for my daughter. She loves it. It is solid 14k gold. It’s timeless and beautiful. Extremely happy!,1
5,"This orange saddle was a bit larger than the other ones I purchased in other colors by the same brand. They fit well around the wings, stay put, and protect well. This one fits my Orpington hen more like a cape than a saddle because of its size, but it stays put.",1
4,I love this shirt.  Comfy and fits as expected.  Very casual and relaxed fit.,1
1,"Cheap quality polyester dress. Don’t waste your time, it looks nothing like the picture",0
3,"These panties are of good quality but are too small, especially after washing.  The size I bought is my normal size.",0
2,Bought size medium. Size 8-1 women’s dresses. Fit well but the cut on top wasn’t flattering. Will return.,0
2,It doesn't really look like the hat you have in the photo and it defiently is smaller than it looks too. I like that I have it but it doesn't look exact. A bit disappointed.,0
5,It was perfect and I used it for a quinces.,1
1,To be completely accurate on how the sizing on this is it should be in youth sizes. Think tween sizing. Not to mention it's more like the material used on a rug. If I could leave no or negative stars I would.,0
2,"Got the costume for a Halloween party this year. The shorts were nothing like what I expected (too poofy overall). The vest was horrible. I tried it on once and the zipper broke. The belt, gun holsters, and fake guns on the other hand were awesome. They were the only parts I used for my costume. Overall, it wasn't worth it. You could make a costume by yourself for cheaper.",0
2,"Very,very tiny.  Hard to get on because they are so small.",0
4,I loved it! The only thing is I thought it would be just a little bigger but luckily I was able to fit everything in it.,1
5,fits and looks great,1
3,The product is too small and compresses the nerves causing my hands to go to sleep.  Please order up  in sizes.,0
3,ok,0
3,Nice when it's a little chilly in the morning.,0
1,Skirt is see through and the elastic at the top of the skirt is folds and twist,0
5,"Larger than other drawstring bags I have used, I can fit all my gym clothes plus a towel to shower and it's still not stuffed full. Best money I've spent on a gym accessory, would recommend.",1
5,"Awsome stuff, useful as i have many cables and i used to lost them and brok them all the time<br /><br />this organizer was really useful for me<br /><br />thanks",1
4,"I got a size 12 like a different ring i got a week ago. The other size 12 ring fit perfect, this felt smaller (slightly) than that size 12 so beware",1
3,Pendant is good but the chain broke immediately.,0
3,"Long wait for this heated vest has just arrived today, and it turned out to be quite disappointed on the size, the quality seems to be good, very soft inner, plugged into a battery power bank and can feel it getting warm, but it's the size that just way off. I like to wear my vest fitted which will be size (M) US, so I ordered two size up (XL) and it still run very small, good thing that the fabric has little bit of room to stretch, so I was able to forced the zipper to closed, gonna let the wife have this one.  just reordered another size XXXL, hopefully this will not be too big nor still small.<br />Update: Just received 3xl today, am glad I ordered 3xl, tried on and just snugged fit.",0
3,"Good price, I like the style, as far as texture, it's like plastic, and little tight on wrist",0
5,"Wow! Every now and then you get a t-shirt that's just PERFECT, and this one really is for me. It's super-super soft, but well constructed with moderately thick fabric (should last 1-3 years rather than 6 months before showing wear). The color is perfect (as pictured), the sleeves are on the short side (unlike men's sleeves, which come nearly to your elbows), and the length is long enough to cover your butt if you're wearing leggings. And did I mention that it's butter soft? This is already my new favorite shirt",1
5,"Love it , perfect exactly for what I need",1
1,not at all what was expected  - returned product,0
2,Haven’t even had them for 2 months and one is already broken. The original one that came with my fitness watch lasted 3 years. At least it was a 2 pack.,0
3,"I love the colors. The rubber strap is solid. The case itself is a cheap build. The crown button is consistently loose. Water got inside the glass when I was washing my hands, but the watch kept running. I bought this watch primarily for it's appearance. As long as it keeps running, I'll be happy.",0
3,"Cute but runs small, order a full size up.",0

5,Cute but does run a bit small. I wear it w leggings.,1
5,I like them.,1
3,"It's well made, design is nice, yoshi is like colored in like crayon you can't really tell on the picture, still cute. The smallest size I bought youth small and its more like a large for kids.

5,Great fit!,1
1,"Not true to size,was not as long as the picture",0

2,"Runs a little small, not as soft as expected, color of shirt didn't match the color of the waist band, cuffs or neck..shade lighter maybe... Not for me..",0
4,"The night light /projector was smaller in size than expected, but it is a good gift idea. I like that it can run on batteries or be plugged in with a USB cord.",1
1,I just recieved this item and is for a gift tonight and am horrified by how dull an dingy this is! Almost a tarnished patina to it which is strange since is to be stainless steel. I am embarrassed to give and now have to rush out and find a gift for my friend.,0
5,"Bought for a friend, she really likes them.",1
1,Would be a super cute dress except it has a seam under the left breast. Really disappointed!,0
2,Pants are at a good price but the picture and description is not what you get. The spots was not hot pink but red.,0

2,I little bit tight on a BBW's neck but still fits and is cute,0
1,"Cheaply made off of the black slave watch it it’ll die your clothes,",0
5,Seems to be well made. Just what I was looking for.,1
4,"Love this skirt. I am 5’6” and 136 pounds. I wear a US 6 and the Medium fits just great. It is linen so it gets a a little warm and wrinkles...to be expected. I do wish it had just one more button down the front as the slit hits my knees a little bit high and rubs. However, worth it for $17 as it looks much pricier.",1
5,"Light and soft fabric, great summer dress. Perfect for a walk on the beach or a social gathering. I'm 5'3 and 138lb. I took Small, it fits like a glove.",1
1,3x fit like a 1x,0
5,Helps my back issue!,1
5,"I got the interlocking circles necklace because I wear rose gold mostly but have some silver pieces. It's lovely, my daily necklace. Had a delicate but substantial presence.",1
2,"Runs small IMO. Ordered medium based on other reviews, and it was uncomfortable tight. I normally wear 8-10 in pants, and am a fairly fit individual with a white girl booty. (5'9&#34; tall, 145 lbs)",0
1,"This took almost 3 months to get to me. I ordered a necklace but instead received a small 'do it yourself' item.. I tried to take it out of the plastic and it literally fell apart. I basically made my own necklace, it looks cute but its really not worth the price. (Even though its dirt cheap) I wouldn't want anyone to be disappointed as I was, word of advice..dont waste your time/money.",0
4,"Just the right size and matches picture shown. I did notice one small internal inclusion when looking at it up close.<br /><br />While it is not needed, you may want to consider swapping out the chain this comes with as the quality does not seem to match the pendant, it is very thin and the clasp could be better.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />For the price I don’t believe you’ll find a better pendant made of topaz in this CT size.<br />Picture shown matches exactly with what you get.<br />Elegant looking pendant that is not too big/gaudy or too small to be noticed.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />The chain it comes with is just ok, it is too thin in my opinion and does not match well with the pendants elegant design.<br />Possible to have inclusion in the stone, so it may not be perfect.",1
1,The clasps are cheap and break...do not buy,0
1,Ordered two sizes up and xxlarge for a woman it fit my 10 year old niece,0
5,I bought a few different long sleeve shirts at the same time.  All different brands. This is my favorite out of the them.  It looks and feels good.  I’m buying another one now.,1
2,"They're a nice shape, but came without earing backings and the posts were bent and warped. Would return, but they're honestly just in such bad shape that I'm not sure its even possible.",0
5,Was a gift& she loved..,1
5,"Never seen this material before, but it's beautiful!  And from what I've heard from our jeweler, it's good hard material.  Beautiful shine also on it.  Wish the infinity sign going around the ring wasn't so pointy though.  But other than that, I love it, it's beautiful.",1
2,"These pants were nearly 3 inches too short and very snug at the waist. I have a 35 inch waist and purchased a size 34 that should have expanded to 35 easily according to the size chart. Otherwise, good quality.",0
4,It's a little &#34;blousey&#34; in front but workable.  Love the color.,1
1,So I work overseas and we wear cargo pants all the time. I ordered my size for my hip size. It fits around the hips fine which is not the problem. I am a 43 hip ans 27 waist. but i am fit just curvy. however theses pants are once size from the hips to the ankles. So i literally look like I'm walking around ins a 2001 hip hop music video. The pants are sooooo baggy they cover my shoes...and i wear a size 9 shoes. 5'7 athletic built. the texture is great! quality is great too. But these feel like men pants. the pant legs have absolutely no definition. I wore them one time and every one was looking at me crazy at work. lol I am just going to give it to one of the guys i cant return it due to my location :(,0
1,"Absolutely terrible, extremely small and cheaply made.",0
2,extremely fragile lost a leg and arm already on the from and way smaller then I though it’s hard to read,0
2,"I had high hopes for these shorts, but the white ones were so thin and extremely see through. You can see the pockets through the legs even",0
5,Great- love them,1
4,"I thought it really was Nike brand, from the label I can see it is a copy. It appears to be of good quality and is the same as the photo. I bought an L but it's more like an XL. Despite everything I like how it looks.",1
1,"I did not like the quality of the jacket, and especially disliked the zipper.",0
3,Didn’t read the description well so I had to send this back. There is only one cuff and it was a little bulky for mr🙃,0
2,Feels nice. Great color. But it's child sized.,0
5,Perfect for summer in Florida!,1
5,"These socks are a great quality, not too thick, adorable and they even have little grippers inside to keep them from slipping off. Everyone who sees them on my son's little feet smiles and comments how cute they are.",1
3,"Ordered according to size chart, still a bit snug.",0
4,Good pants,1
5,"Very cute little ""run-around"" dress.....comfy.....get many compliments!!  LOL",1
3,Don't order this cute dress unless you have the thighs to carry it off.  This dress is shorter than any other dress in my closet.  I limit to wearing around the house because I have lumpy thighs.  LOL<br />Landers well and is a very fair price.,0
4,"I like them, looked better than<br />They appeared on the website.<br />Going to get some RX put in<br />Them.",1
2,For me personally they aren't comfortable. They are tight across the top of my foot near the ankle so they get tighter as I step. I would have returned them but they were open. They may fit someone else better. I usually wear 8.5 or 9.,0
3,"Not bad, but not my favorite top.  The fit is fine, but does not have an elegant look or feel.  But it washes well in cold water and does not shrink.",0
1,Received package in mail but this item was not there.,0
2,"Loved this when I received it and used it everyday with my watch, started to stretch out and eventually broke apart. If it would last longer for the price then I would buy again but I’m not gonna waste my money again.",0
3,"I bought these as a Christmas gift and they arrived in plenty of time, which was appreciated.  However, one of the shoes arrived with a large spot of glue on the top of the shoe that is not able to be cleaned off or fixed in any way.  I tried everything I could think of and then reached out to the seller, who offered me $6.  I just wanted shoes without a large flaw or guidance on how to remove the glue myself, which they couldn't give.  They did answer fairly promptly.",0
4,"Good quality,true to size but length is kinda longer than I expected it to be.I am 101lbs and with 4'11 height,I ordered extra small and it fits me well and the dress length reach up to my calf 😬 which I expected it to be a knee length or a little below knee.",1
5,I have the long sleeve dresses and the blue short sleeve. I love these dresses; I just would like for the company to make more colors available in both styles. I always get compliments and &#34;stares&#34; lol. The other suggestion would be for the bottom layer to be a little thicker. I have noticed a hole in both my blue long/short sleeve dress and who wants to have to buy two new dresses.,1
3,The case itself is nice but the screen protector that comes with it is the same size as the opening so there’s literally nothing holding the clear plastic in place. It just falls right out. The directions were all in Japanese so that was no help either.,0
3,"Heads up, ships from China, so don’t expect it too fast. Other than that, apply your own feeling about buying from China. The website wont/doesnt let us know where products come from, wish they would. I might pay a couple bucks more if I knew it was coming sooner and “local”.<br />Bracelet is OK, looks too small for an adult, but is on a stretchy band so my wife got it on OK. Just hope it doesn’t snap after a couple days.",0
5,"Super cute one piece. I love that the straps aren't crossed in the back (I get tension headaches) and the ruching on the side is nice. Good coverage on the booty, and I like the built in shelf bra.",1
2,it didnt work i ordered because it said it was universal,0
5,"I ordered the orange bag for my mom for Christmas. First, the color is fantastic. It's brighter then the picture shows, more like a tangerine, which was perfect for me. It also was delivered super quick, it originally estimated a week for delivery but it came in two days! It was packaged very well with multiple layers to make sure the leather doesn't get scratched. I am super happy with the product and can't wait to give it as a Christmas gift.",1
1,Super tiny and barely even visible.,0
4,Good quality.  Medium size is a bit tight for me (42&#34; chest).  I'm giving this one to my son and ordering a Large for myself.,1
4,"I really wasn't expecting a lot due to the price. However, this is a very pretty necklace. The color of the gem is absolutely beautiful.  I honestly didn't get to keep it too long. My sister in law saw it and fell in love. Due to the price, I had no problem handing it over it her. I would definitely purchase this again. I would definitely recommend this.",1
4,Look's good on.,1
5,Great fit! Love them!,1
5,"I’m 5’2, 115 pounds most of the time. I have 34B cup and wear a size two usually and ITS A GREAT FIT.<br /><br />Lovely dress. Hugs my curves in all of the right places.",1
1,broke in 2 sec,0
2,"You would think if the description says ""loose"" it'd at least fit.<br />It's way too small, not loose at all!",0
5,Bought for myself after buying the baby version,1
2,Wasn't big on the quality so I gave it away.,0
5,I bought this watch band for my Charge 3..it fits perfectly and is very feminine!,1
5,"THANK YOU for a great experience in shopping with you ! The items are in terrific in looks, feel and comfort.",1
5,Very nice,1
1,They are 1990 cut/ boot cut spandex like Richard Simmons spandex zero cotton and look nothing like this picture-,0
5,"Love these ear rings! They are of a nice size, well made, and fun! They are actually more beautiful than shown; the colored areas have pearlescent/reflective component that the pictures do not show. Recommended.",1
5,"My husband bought this for my birthday and it came just in time, I love it and it is made well too, I will wear it with everything!",1
4,The watch has very cool games<br />Its jus not that durable,1
5,These worked very well for our stretching and I loved the color! The material made it very easy to stretch without pain and I really enjoyed the rubbers and little etch keeping them in place! I did have them come loose once or twice but I honestly wasn't too careful so I can't blame the product.,1
5,Cheap but very fun. Exactly what I would expect.,1
5,Very nice,1
1,The dress fit my granddaughter perfect and was beautiful for her “Father Daughter Dance” but the zipper came unsewn from the dress. We didn’t have time to order a new dress or to exchange it so we had to repair ourselves. Hopefully this was just a streak of bad luck on our part and the other dresses are better assembled.,0
5,I couldn't be more pleased!  The necklace is perfect and beautiful!  It is so dainty and personalized.  It deserves more than 5 stars.,1
2,I found the clips on these ultra thin frames intrusive. They caused distractions when driving. The full frame version is far more superior. SKIP THE ULTRA THIN FRAMES,0
5,"I fell in love with this watch, and since gold and gems are not involved it is not too expensive.  A Japanese quartz battery movement in a blacked stainless steel case with rosewood embellishments; what could be more basic, and yet very impressive.  If burgundy and black are your colors you'll love this time-piece.",1
1,This is sized to fit a small child!!! This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for a woman!!! How embarrassing to see her put it on and the sleeves hit just past her elbows!!!  The draw string is cheap rope!!! Give me my money back,0
2,You have to order big size to look like in the picture,0
5,"Simple dress, well made, def go up a size. Over all super great value!",1
1,This is a super strange fit. The body suit fits strange over the boobs. As if my boobs are in the exact center of my chest...tight together.,0
5,Excellet goggles.  They fit well and give excellent vision.,1
5,"Comfortable, soft and fit like a glove. I’m only 5’4”, 130 lbs.",1
5,Fits Perfectly: Great Comfort: Lasts for about a month or two,1
3,"It was cute and flattering, but the tie at the neck was bulky and awkward",0
2,Very small and I think they shrank when I washed them. Came with a funny smell. Smell is gone but they are now very small. 😖,0
1,"I purchased this shirt for work. Bought a medium - it would have fit my 5 year old.  The material is more sheer than I expected. The material was stretchy, but not enough to fit well. Returned.",0
5,Fit great and pretty cool looking - my son loves them. He is 5' 8&#34; and about 120lbs...,1
5,Got this for hubby on his bday and he loves them! They are made very well and look just like the picture. They are soft and just the right style for him!,1
1,Siempre he comprado de la misma talla pero este venía más grande de lo usual,0
3,I once gave this a 3 star because the shoe is very uncle after about 10 minutes of walking. I once recommended wearable this if going to ding and the distance from the car to restaurant is short. Movie theater would work also.,0
3,These are not knee high socks.  They re too tight at the top to go to the knee.  But they are cute and will work with my Halloween costume.,0
5,Really soft inside loved it,1
1,I got the biggest size they had because I was afraid it would end up being a little small. I received it & it was extremely small! Didn't bother trying them on,0
5,Excelente!,1
5,As advertised,1
3,Received size 2x bigger<br />Dont know how good they are since my daughter can't wear them yet.,0
1,This mask “not a helmet” is floppy and big.  It’s so big the mouth doesn’t even move.  Save your money.,0
1,I returned this.  This would have been an embarrassing gift to give to someone.,0
3,I should have ordered a size smaller.,0
5,So easy and cute to throw on!  Easy for dress up or down,1
2,So so,0
5,"Fits all of my essentials for a day at preschool!  iPhone mini 12 in one pocket, small notebook and two pens for anecdotal notes in second pocket, room keys in outside zipper slot, and personal items: lip balm, hand lotion, breath freshener under no zipper snap flap. Perfect!",1
4,"Super cute and nice tint! I bought it for a festival and was able to use it for the weekend, but broke super easily after that. But as expected, you get what you pay for",1
5,It has a beautiful design - so much to look at!,1
3,Ok is all,0
1,scratchy and cheap feeling material. may work as a second layer.,0
4,"I would highly recommend these pajamas.  The color and material are very nice.  They fit as expected and are true to size.  I liked them so well, I went back and purchased the other color that was available.",1
3,These shoes are so cute and stylish for a toddler. They look great with jeans and slacks. However the shoe strings are a trip! I would’ve given them a 5 star rating if they had Velcro straps. The shoe strings wouldn’t stayed tied so you had to tie them in a knot which then made them a pain to get off and on.,0
5,I love this dress. It was very cute on,1
2,"Sadly it ripped right at the connector after a few weeks, which was really a bummer because it was comfortable and breathable!",0
1,I ordered this and followed size chart and it was completely wrong. I ordered a XL and it looks more like a 2x or 3x.,0
2,"This is not a dress... it is straight up a shirt. It doesn't even cover my butt. Tall people be Warned.... I am 6""1.",0
5,It is a nice suit.  I just ordered a size a little too big for me.,1
5,Purchased for my granddaughters 6th birthday and of course she loved it.,1
5,I love them. They look great.,1
1,"When I received this necklace I was very disappointed with the quality. It looked worn, tarnished, scratched and overall looked nothing like the pictures. Totally not worth what I paid. I DO NOT recommend getting this necklace.",0
1,Not true to size !,0
5,"Buy one size too large, then wash & dry by machine.  Great fit, great cushioning, & great socks!",1
5,"This product has exceeded my expectations; my child glowed once I put the cape and mask on, he immediately started running around the house yelling &#34;Super Hero!&#34; Wacthing took me back to when I was a child doing the same thing the  differance is I had a pillow case as a cape. These high quality capes have a Velcro safety snap to easily be removed from around your childs neck so no need to worry. This item is great for you young childs imaginative play and I would recommend it to anyone.",1
5,Just what I needed!,1
5,Top material and construction. Not a flimsy thin blues.,1
5,"I love this little keychain - it’s colorful with a nice design.  It takes a while to arrive, but that’s to be expected and it’s worth the wait!",1
5,Second pair I have ordered as my hubby loves the comfort,1
3,Kids sized,0
5,Was a gift for my birthday. This bag will serve me well I. The weekend travels I do for many years to come. Very well built and price is right.,1
5,This pair of earrings are of very high quality.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  They are perfect for an elegant evening or to add a little pizzazz to your daytime attire.,1
5,"It's super warm. The hat portion fits well. The part that covers the nose and mouth is large when snapped on to the hat. It has elastic attached to it to go around your ears. Attaching it that way, it fits well. I received this hat at a discount.",1
1,"Runs large, doesn’t wash easily.",0
5,Thumbs up,1
1,Returned because they fit very short!,0
5,"Great fit, look and quality. Fast shipping. Very easy purchase.",1
1,It fit OK before I washed it in cold water and let it air dry....Massive shrinkage,0
1,The item sent looks absolutely nothing like the nice open cardigan/coat in the photo. It was awful.,0
5,Great sandal,1
3,"I ordered this dress 2 sizes larger than I wear because of some reviews saying it runs smaller in sizing. WELL!! the arms were absolutely way too tight. I had to cut them just to get the dress on!. My best friend had to let the seams out, they DO NOT allow much excess material to do this, and she had to make the sleeves shorter and we added material very close to same as dress so I could wear it. I love the dress color, its a beautiful gown. I shouldnt have had to make so many alterations to wear it.<br />And for those that might ask..I contacted seller/company and was told return dress as it was purchased and a larger one would be sent out. There was  NO TIME for all that! I wore this for my sons wedding.",0
5,My husband wore this outfit for Halloween at the Dojo with the little kids and they loved it. He said it was comfortable and easy to get on.. And he was able to do Deadpool type things in it...,1
3,"the fabric feels very nice and it looks good in the front, but in the profile it is very figure-unflattering, makes you look like a fat square. I were it once and donated it. For reference I am 5'7&#34;, 145 lb.",0
1,"Could not get foot in boot , could not get ankle past the neoprene.",0
5,great socks -- snug fit,1
5,Very comfortable! Breathable! Nice design as well.,1
1,It really didn’t have any scratch,0
1,Way to small you definitely need to go up a size or two. They definitely will crush you manhood.,0
5,"The bag has many compartments,  making it handy as a day bag.  Appears to be well made.",1
5,"I was a little nervous ordering these. I am anywhere from an xxl to xl and I ordered in xl and they fit perfect! They are so cute and comfortable and breathable! They came today and I was so excited to try them on! They did not disappoint! Perfect for everyday wear running errands, working out, around the house! Can't say enough how much I love them! Very flattering on as well!",1
3,This set had a great fit (although thicker would be more flattering) but I ordered it in white and it was so see through. Everything on the leggings is see through below the band (the band is thicker and looks less sheer) making it super obvious that your skin and everything shows through. I should have listened to the other reviews. I have other white sets that don’t have this problem.,0
1,This shirt is beautiful and the fabric is great but the size is extremely small for the fit. It's almost 2 sizes too small if not three.,0
5,Arrived promptly and item is as expected.,1
5,Bought this to make a custom shirt using HTV. The HTV adhered very nicely to this material.,1
5,This is everything ai expected it to be.<br />Very chic and tribal-looking.,1
1,"Does not look like the picture.  Chain is thicker, and the heart is different. I threw mine in the garbage",0
5,Good quality,1
5,"Very cute, great quality. Necklace came exactly as described and the size is perfect.",1
4,Looks really nice,1
5,comfortable and anti-slip bottom major plus,1
5,"Very good quality for the price,am buying again",1
5,Bought as a present she loved it.,1
3,"Item is cute, but bracelet is super small and not adjustable.  This would be a great product if you could adjust the bracelet to accommodate a variety of wrist sizes.",0
1,The soles fell apart last week. 3 weeks of use and now they are trash bound. Poor product.,0
4,Very beautiful super softe thight very very good quality the only thing is I ordered the gray and it no where close to as the gray in the picture really disappointed me other then the color problem it’s so beautiful,1
1,The size on this was way off and didn’t fit my son at all. You also have to pay to ship the item back.,0
1,"You get what you pay for, Broke In less than 30 days after purchase.",0
5,"changing the laces on my old shoes made them look new again :-) they're a standard size - i was worried they might be too long, but they actually fit well. Very happy!",1
2,"Seems to be made of good quality BUT the milkman wording is sooooo off center. Will return and try order once more, but if the problem is corrected I’ll buy elsewhere.",0
5,Beautiful,1
3,Did not fit and a piece on the front that scratched my forehead,0
2,The color is beautiful. The sizing.? Is ridiculous...4 sizes to small.  Even after other reviews and I ordered larger.  Offer is half price for return or pay postage. Hopefully I can give it away.,0
5,"Ordered this for my dau when on sale, wish I ordered one for myself!  It is not thin or see-through which is great! Has nice hidden pockets along the side seams.  Yeah!  It fits just perfect, ie true to size.  She took it on her cruise for casual-wear, but also plans to wear it to work.",1
2,"It's baggy as it should be, but it's completely see thru!",0
5,Love these shorts. They fit me great!,1
5,Favorite sweatpants I’ve ever owned. Sooooo comfortable.,1
5,beautiful dress and the royal blue was as pictured I wore for wedding and it was comfortable and perfect I ordered xl and I am 5ft5 and weight 177lbs,1
3,"Super cute, but Make sure to read the sizing- it fits small so you need to size up. These are costume hoodies, and do not wash well. My daughter adored it, so I had to wash it a lot and it wore out quickly. It was to be expected because I read the reviews, but again- do not be surprised",0
3,"Cute, but runs small",0
5,My lady loves this.  Says it's not too big and not too small and is perfect for the things she carries.  Got the grey leather kind and looks pretty cool or in her words &#34;cute&#34;.  Shipping was fast and everything is here as promised.,1
2,"It runs small. I have a small to average sized wrist and could not get it to close around my wrist without being tight and uncomfortable. It looks like a child's size. The bracelet itself is pretty, but the round stones do not lay flat, they are raised above the rest of the stones in an odd way.",0
5,Love everything about the brand.  Always top quality.,1
2,The fit overall is a little tight. The lenses are a darker and less clear. I am giving this pair away now since I can't get a refund.,0
5,Very nice. Allows me to access my cards with one hand which is what I was looking for.,1
5,Perfect for toddler on the 4th!,1
3,Love it but not the write size I order 1XL  and I got Large that’s the only disappointment and I had to wear it because I buy bag and shoes for it,0
1,"This dress was missing a hook when I took it out of the package, but that didn't matter much because I ordered an XXL for my XL self and it still didn't fit. My tiny 9 year old sister tried it on before I boxed it back up and it actually fit her better than it did me. Thank heavens for free returns!",0
3,"The fabric is very sheer and you can see right through the cream color. It is cheaply made, but will work as the under piece for a costume, but not as a dress as I had hoped.",0
5,"I love this shirt! Great colors, material! Feels like nice quality! Will order more!",1
5,The bracelet was nicer then I expected.  It will be a gift for my sister!!,1
5,Such a cute tote! Has great material quality.,1
4,"They are nice , took long then expected to get here . Works well",1
5,I must say I love this hat,1
4,Nice Quality,1
3,"I wanted this because it is long sleeved but the version I received had sleeves just past the elbow, which isn't what is pictured. The material was sheer and nice, but overall not what I was looking for.",0
5,Just received these yesterday. My grand daughter loves them. Very dainty.,1
2,One size does not fit all,0
1,cheap quality...metal bends...do not buy,0
2,"I wanted to like this watch and I would, except for the fact that condensation forms on the inside and thus obscures the view (pretty much defeating the purpose). It dissipates when I'm not wearing it (see previous parenthetical comment) but forms again when I put it on. I don't think of myself as a particularly damp person, so I have to think we're looking at product issues here. I've neglected to take care of this in time and the return window closed yesterday--totally my fault for not being on top of it.",0
5,"Bought both rings for my boyfriend and I. They're really cool they change colors (as a mood ring should) and they look really nice for the price. I have very sensitive skin and I was worried if this ring would irritate my skin. But I've worn this ring in the shower, rain, sleeping, working, and in the gym and nothing has happened, no red marks or discoloration it's awesome. Overall I would recommend this ring, my boyfriend and I wanted something matching but didn't want to spend a lot on something. This was a great price, it doesn't irritate my skin, looks cool, and hasn't faded.",1
5,My son loves his cleats. Very satisfied with the quality.,1
3,"You will have to restring the top unless you are a very small person.  I weigh 123 pounds and I am not huge chested, but it still was super tight for me.",0
5,Nice fit.  True to size,1
3,Key chain a little heavy. Hard to open key chain to hook on to belt loop,0
4,this shirt looks great on the hanger the design is nice and simple so it will go with just about anything and is long enough to be worn with leggings the material looks and feels nice and it wears well the only problem is that it is see thru so you can adjust your bra color but with it so long you will not want to tuck it in but you will be able to see what ever color of bottoms you are wearing thru the shirt so makes it look no so professional,1
3,Turned my girlfriends ear green,0
2,"I love the style and roomy pickets- I also love that it falls between fitting like capris and Bermuda shorts. I do not like the inconsistency in sizing. Ordered two the same size, one fit and the other was way too small. I am a size 12 and ordered way bigger “just in case”- 36 fit like a 32. Also very thin cotton, ripped after two wearing son seam, but I sewed it. I really like the style.",0
5,"Good fabric. Good quality. Fits accordingly. I have received compliments, excellent ones.",1
1,"Cool look and easy to install, but the quick release pin fell off on just the second time putting it on the watch. Such a bummer",0
5,"The yoga pants came in a day earlier than expected. I am 5'4, and 170 pounds and I ordered a large. I am between an 8 or 10 in USA size for pants. Hip size is 43 1/2 inches.<br />When I tried it on, oh my goodness, it felt amazing. The material was soft and similar to the Victoria Secret's yoga pants. Although there is still a little bit of room, it still fits perfectly on me and I like that it is not too tight. It might also be a little longer than expected as shown in my picture, but it isn't as noticeable. Its very comfortable to walk around in and to do things in. I did not really see any issues with the yoga pants and the large fit perfectly on me. It isn't see through, but obviously like other typical yoga pants, you can see the underwear line a bit. Usually I am not a fan of leggings that open at the bottom because I am used to wearing the tight leggings, these are an exception. I can't wait to wear them outside!<br /><br />Product provided for a review by Aenlley",1
3,"Purchased for summer they're too heavy weight. The fit is nice, as expected. The color pretty. They wash well and are soft. The collar lies funny and the corners don't lie flat they curl up.",0
1,Very thin you can see right through it !!,0
3,I Love the way the way this watch band looks.  I wish it was a little bigger.  I have to put it on the last notch.,0
5,keep buying... perfect product,1
5,Love it!,1
3,It's a pretty cool mask it's just kind of cheesy the hair doesnt stick out like the pic at all,0
3,"Purchase was made to replace an identical pair lost earlier this year. Sadly, one earring lacks some tension leading to the earring not remaining on one ear.",0
4,"Everyone kept saying to buy two sizes larger in their reviews.  I don't agree. I normally wear a small and purchased a medium.  I think small would've been fine.  The material is very soft. It may shrink after washing though, so I'm keeping the medium.",1
5,Love it!,1
3,"Cute skirt but runs very small.  I normally wear a medium in bottoms and this thing made me look like a stuffed sausage!  I exchanged for the XL and it fit better, but the elastic waistband was still a bit tight, even when sitting at my natural waist (30in).  Material is ok and flowy; not quite what I thought it was going to be but it was comfortable for my vacation.  I'd recommend this skirt to those who have a pretty small waist/hips, otherwise it's just not flattering IMO and the button elastics will over stretch.",0
1,Doesn't work on Samsung phones!!!!,0
2,"I received the incorrect size.<br />I expected small and instead I received xxl.<br />However I see where small might have been a problem since the<br />hip fit was a little loose but more or less ok.<br />Also, instead of 3/4 sleeves, I got one with long sleeves.",0
2,"I am a plus size women. This vest is much to short! Also the straps are not long enough. The ""ice"" bags were in Chinese and I had no idea what to do with them. You have to carefully fill them with water, shake, and freeze. A little tricky. I think it would keep you cool for awhile, just is NOT made for bigger people!",0
5,Love it!!,1
5,Perfect for any Jurassic Park fan :),1
5,A quality inspirational bracelet. It has a nice and durable polish and it has a positive inspirational message inscribed on it.,1
1,"Bought 2, same size different colors. Firstly I was disappointed that the fabric is so heavy. Just trying it on I felt hot and uncomfortable. I can’t imagine wearing this fishing or camping.<br />Secondly, the gray color one is super short! I’m talking looking like Gus Gus from Cinderella so no picture of that one. Then I tried the olive color one and it is huge! Super long sleeves and comes down to my mid thigh. To make matters worse it has seams with lots of threads coming undone on the inside of the shirt.<br />Not worth it IMO. Great price point, but not a good product unfortunately.<br />For reference I wear L shirts in other similar cut shirts (REI, Columbia).",0
5,"I love this dress, BUT make sure you follow the directions for washing this product. Also, the garments could be a little looser in the arm and breast area. Other than that I love this dress. Oh when I got the dress it has 3-4 little small blue spots on the dress, but I got something and got it out.",1
5,I absolutely adore this pouch. It has become my favorite wallet that can fit everything! The material is great!,1
1,Que se pusieron feos el la segunda puesta,0
3,"These earrings are very pretty and sparkly, however they're super heavy and the backs of them are very ugly. The back is just silver indents. Anyway, you get what you pay for. Not sure if I'll be wearing these for my wedding like I originally planned.",0
5, ,1
3,The socks are comfortable but the colors are faded and not vibrant as shown in the picture.,0
4,Elastic fit and cool the wear,1
5,So beautiful I like it a lot,1
5,Muy bonito y fácil de colocar,1
5,I get compliments whenever I wear the necklace. It really makes a statement.,1
4,"Very cute, bought a size up, and its huge on my daughter. Looked like a night gown. Couldn't wear it this year, ill have to wait until next year. Id say buy true to size.",1
3,Not for lower body days,0
1,"The ear rings make me painful 😣, because that connect part between butterflies and chains are big, could not pierced it if your ear pieces are small.",0
5,Estoy feliz con la compra,1
4,Size up,1
1,"Do yourself a favor and dont bother unless it's for a child or a prop. Ordered a size nine, this is more like a size 5. The ""Opal"" is a plastic bead with shiny plastic glued to it.",0
4,"My wife really likes these Madeline Kelly hi-cut briefs. She says they're comfortable, nice-looking, and seem to be well-made. She did, however, mention that they seem to run small as far as sizing goes.",1
5,Received many compliments on these. Very cute,1
4,"I liked the dress but had to return it because it was too short. Other than the length, the fit was as expected.",1
1,"These pajamas are stiff, no stretch..and I mean NO STRETCH! And they run two sizes too small. What he heck? This is a name brand. I also bought 2 pairs as Christmas gifts that I’m just sending back. Don’t waste your money. I’m so disgusted.",0
1,"I never pay much for sunglasses, but these seemed especially cheap. The sun seems to shine in the sides, not a wonderful thing while driving",0
4,My daughter will have to grow into these.  super cute though!,1
2,Earrings are beautiful and very sparkly but I’m not sure if they are Moissanite or CZ. The description uses both words and I did not receive a warranty or certificate like I did with other Moissanite purchases. Also the backing does not fit tightly and I would be afraid that it might come off easily. I am returning as a result.,0
3,Quisiera consultarles como se activa la luz de la esfera de este reloj Aguardo sus comentarios<br />I would like to ask you how the light of the dial of this watch is activated.I wait your comments<br />Send by email<br />arnoldopasik@yahoso mucho.com.ar<br />Thank you,0
5,Beautiful charms.,1
3,Not as it looks in the picture. The quality is good but it turned out to be not my style.,0
3,Not as lightweight as we wanted it but it’s a fine jacket.,0
4,"Some reviews said to go up a size, so I went from a medium to a large. Although it’s super comfy, I wish I would’ve gone with a medium because there isn’t any cinching at the waist so it kinda hangs straight down on me.  It’s definitely comfortable so it’s more of a lounge shirt for me.",1
5,I love love love this shirt. Can layer or wear by itself. perfect for Southern California spring weather,1
4,Good,1
4,fits well as the tunic material is soft and it does fit the bust area fine,1
3,Disappointing....my normal size and too small. Sent them back.,0
2,"The shoe is fine, although slightly different than the picture. It isn’t as sturdy as it appears. The pink flower decoration around the heel and toe came off in less than 2 weeks. These should be $9.99 or less based on the quality.",0
4,Really cute!,1
4,One of the apron ties was installed twisted so I had to restring it.,1
2,"This tie is nice quality, but it is NOT EXTRA LONG.  It is about 4 inches short of that description.  Did not serve my purpose",0
1,"Wrong color!! They are supposed to be all dark purple, but they have white edges and elastics",0
3,It broke the same day I wear it,0
5,Great fit.  So comfortable. I love the placement of the pockets.,1
1,Ordered a medium. It Fitz like and extra large and when I tried to send it back for a different size they told me it would be $105 for shipping to China. So now I’m stuck with a dress that I can’t wear.,0
2,Tiny.,0
2,"Material is super thin , the arms are not full as shown in picture. Might wear it as a swimsuit coverup MAYBE",0
5,Love the it. Wear it all the time,1
5,"In love with this purse, it is authentic and very beautiful ❤️",1
5,i really like these there made very well..and look great in the necklaces ive made..love them thank you,1
3,Like the earrings-wish there was more stud for the backing since it picked my ear to wear but they are cute,0
3,I wore this dress to my son's open house. It was very pretty and comfortable. I did have to double loop the buttons in the breast area because the loops are way too stretchy and my bra kept playing peek-a-boo. I am going to have a friend just sew the dress closed.,0
1,Did not like at all<br />Hood flopped around and fit poorly around the head<br />Fell over eyes or too far back,0
4,Beautiful but runs small,1
3,"Not good for yard work, really wanted these to work, first few weeks I was satisfied. Got around to some yard work and went to scratch a piece of grass from lens. Was surprised my fingernail took mirror tint right off.",0
5,Fit,1
5,Color is gorgeous,1
3,Not the quality I expected. Too much trouble to return. Maybe my young niece can use it.,0
4,Really like them be replaced ear hook with sterling silver ones due my metal allergy.,1
5,Great fit.,1
5,"Purchased hat initially for the color to match a vest I bought my husband but it is great quality and fits well - not slouchy, just a regular knit hat.",1
3,"Chain nice length, not too short, but nothing to write home about.",0
1,The first time I wore these “XL” sized joggers I already have a dime sized whole in the crotch.,0
5,These are my favorite things to sleep in. I try to catch them on sale when I can because they're a bit expensive. The cut is very flattering. I don't have to worry about walking around in front of my kids in it because of strategic roushing. They're very light so no swearing. They stretch out very quickly though - which is the only negative but I haven't found anything better.,1
5,"The way my bellybutton was pierced I have to have longer bars and these are the only cute ones I’ve found 🙃 I loved the jewelry tho, good quality and cute!",1
3,"I ordered 3 of these dresses. I received one that my daughter loves, one was the wrong size, and the 3rd wasn't the correct dress.",0
5,Perfect watch for travel!  Not flashy and always keeps perfect time. Alarm is a real plus,1
3,"The rose quartz, amethyst and quartz are a lot bigger than I expected! The interchangeable stones however are crap. The crystal is ok, just tiny. The amethyst is mostly gray and white. The lapis is mostly gray with a tiny bit of blue. The green adventurine is white with a slight green tint. The yellow adventurine is beige. The carnelian is light orange and the red jasper is brown. All stones for the necklace are faded and lackluster. If it weren’t for the bigger stones I would be disappointed.",0
5,"I bought this skirt to wear to my bridal shower, and it was WONDERFUL!!! The fit and finish of the skirt was great, I will be ordering again.",1
3,For the price it is great. Hard to see the small pictures. The quality of the workmanship was obviously flawed. As the cord has a flaw. I would recommend it though.,0
5,"my husband likes this a lot, he said its just like his other flannels he owns some are old mill brand and some from sam's club. this one fits as should.",1
5,"Love this dress.  Love love love the pockets.  For work, I wear this backwards because the V in the front is lower than the V in the back!",1
5,I LOVE Uno de 50 jewelry.  This piece is so cute and you can use as a bracelet as well as an anklet!  LOVE... LOVE ❤️,1
1,I regret buying them. When I opened them and attempted to put one on it broke. I was very disappointed.,0
3,"These sunglasses are made for people with a small face.  I wore them for about 10 minutes and they gave me a headache.  The arms fit tight against the side of your head, and with the tension spring, tends to press tightly.  They also looked small on my face.  I sent these back and ordered the Serengeti Modugno with 66 millimeter lenses versus these that have 60 millimeter lenses.  I haven't received the Modugno yet, but watched a youtube video on them, and they should fit my face better.",0
5,The product is awesome and the price is good.,1
1,turned my neck green within the first three days.,0
3,"It fit nice everywhere else, but the chest is weird. Not sure they know where the boobs go.",0
5,for the price it is pretty cute,1
1,It sucked.,0
3,Follow product description measurements.  I wear either a size 10 or 12 depending on the style and material of dresses.  I ordered a Large and it Fit as expected.  The only reason why I am giving this three stars is due to the skirt being wrinkled after washing and hang drying.,0
3,NOT random selection.  I order 2 sets.  BOTH sets are identical.  a 70 year old does not need a on head scarf.  Scarves are nice but wanted 20 different scarves.,0
1,way to small,0
5,"I like this shawl, but it is very fuzzy and when you take it off you are cover if little fuzz balls. Very warm.",1
5,This is such a nice cover for when company drops by. Mu Mom loves it,1
5,Delivered early...Good quality,1
1,Cheap,0
5,I like these slippers...feels comfortable!,1
3,"I bought this for my daughter, who has been wanting one since she came across mine a few months ago. I liked this one because it was pretty and not too flashy. However, when we got it and went to put it on, it took forever to figure out. Finally after looking at the picture we realized that it only looks good if your hand is facing down, otherwise you just have a bunch of chains all tangled up and looking kind of silly. It would look much nicer if the chains were more secure, even though that style was what drew me to this set, without thinking of how the chains would hang if your hand wasn't down.",0
5,Very soft and comfortable it wear.,1
2,This necklace looks totally different than the one I ordered and it is not well made the clasp is on wrong and causes it to scratch me so I don't wear it.,0
5,Excelent!,1
4,I ordered a half size up when I saw they were smaller than normal. They fit great and they are as comfortable as any other flip flop I have worn. One of the straps on my right foot keeps rubbing against my pinky toe but its not too bad. No blistering and it doesn't hurt.,1
2,My Boys wanted this. I didn't know it was that small.,0
4,"It's very nice.  It &#34;works&#34; on my average guy-sized wrist, but only on the last two holes.  IE, really too small for a guy.  IMO",1
1,DON'T WASTE UR MONEY!! IT FELL APART THE SAME DAY IT WAS DELIVERED!!,0
1,"I was disappointed with this product. I bought it wear while I got a tattoo, and it barely stuck. I kept have to mess with it because it wasn’t holding in place. Wore it for less than 3 hours and i started having issues with it sticking within minutes of putting it on",0
2,"The pendant itself seems sturdy enough and is a nice size, but I was disappointed as soon as I took it out of the package because of the color. While the photos make the flower petal stones appear pink or coral, in reality, they are violet/light purple. Since I just purchased this to wear to a 70's themed party with a particular coral/turquoise colored top, I may end up trying to paint the violet stones. For the price I paid, what can it hurt? I agree with the other reviews - the chain is ugly and cheap looking - I plan to trash it and replace it with a ribbon or something similar. Just remember - you get what you pay for.",0
4,They were a birthday gift.  The recipient loved them.  She loved how dainty they were.  Time will tell about the durability.,1
2,"I bought a medium for my husband (his usual size), but it was too big. He washed and dried the shirt to shrink it, but it didn’t shrink. Be careful of the sizing when you order and size down. The fabric and style are fine, and it is an otherwise good shirt.",0
3,"Not terrible, not amazing..its just alright. It works with what i need it for but this top alone isnt amazing but the fabric is nice a cool which is a plus.",0
3,I would have loved it But I expected for it to be a lot longer like the picture of the model. I bought a size medium I'm 5'1 115lbs and I wore the skirt high waisted and it dropped to my ankles.,0
2,"I purchased a black pair and a blue indigo pair both in extra small.  For some reason the black pair is much, much smaller than the blue pair.  The blue pair fits great, but I could barely get the black pair on.  I will be sending it back.",0
5,"Happy to have bought, buying two more sets first chance I get ^_^",1
1,Dont buy,0
5,Great for a river trip. Fit great and the style and material were awesome.,1
1,"This band is made from very cheap materials. It is so stiff, that putting it in causes damage and bending to the band. Also feels terrible on- it’s plastic and sticks to the skin. Save your money. Very disappointed in the quality.",0
5,They work fine.,1
5,nice...,1
5,It works.,1
5,It’s sturdy and dependable. It came with a 3 year warranty.,1
3,I got an M and I’m usually an M but they were too loose in some areas,0
4,"they arrived on time.  they were a little difficult to put on the bracelet, but I think they will do the job",1
5,These are made for when your sleeping not for when your bathing,1
4,"Love it. Strictly for fashion and not warmth, very thin. Fits perfectly.. kind of boxy at the waste but again, it's a fashion jacket only. Serves its purpose... decent by",1
2,complicated to adjust,0
5,Hubby loved the shirt. He said it felt comfortable and it looks elegant.,1
2,The watch is really nice looking but I ordered twice because I didn't get the bracelet the first time. The bracelet didn't come the second time either. It is a great watch though.,0
3,My 4th grader could have stitched this better. There are pieces of loose thread everywhere. The buttons were sown on with one piece of thick thread and it’s just dangling. The cape has loose threads as well and upon pulling one it seemed to alter it. So no more tugging. I don’t have the time to return it so I will make it look like something.,0
2,Cute shoes and look as pictured but they have a very strong smell that won’t go away! If anyone has any tips on how to get rid of the smell please let me know.,0
5,Best deal in clamps. . these are so much better than metal clamps. I love the ease with which you can use these clamps. No more metal clamps for me ever. They are constructed from a sturdy plastic and of very high quality. Dont buy metal clamps anymore.,1
2,Didn't fit as expected,0
1,"I am returning this item ASAP! They are very cute, perfect color frames, BUT the label on the glasses does not come off 🤨 Makes no sense to walk around with a written label obstructing my vision.",0
1,Cheap quality and not durable. Totally over priced! Not worth the price.,0
3,"Dress was very pretty. But, did not look good on my body type. I'm a size 16/18. I don't like my tummy area too stick out.. and it did. I sent it back. But I did purchase other ""20's"" style dresses that really looked good!",0
3,Looks nothing like the picture,0
5,Good pants,1
5,The product was a perfect size for my needs.,1
3,Very tight. I can't use it but one of my younger children can.,0
1,"It is not real silver like it claims to be , I break out in less than one day and know for a fact I’m not allergic to silver, and I can’t get a response from the seller . Not happy",0
5,"This product made the Halloween costume perfect for my daughter to look like a troll. Easy to use, shipped quickly and was made of good quality material.  I was even able to sew the ears onto a headband for ease of staying on as she ran from house to house.",1
4,a little fragile<br />Special handling use<br />Thank you,1
5,love them; too bad they are short on inventory,1
4,It was very pretty. I got a xs but still fit me big but I'm also very skinny so that's what I was expecting. Other than that I love it.,1
5,"Warm and Blocks wind extremity well while being very thin and light weight. I have the green from Orvis and a light blue from another fishing clothing company. They are identical. So obviously both companies put their stamp on it. Not a shock. I don’t care for the logos, They are not in your face, but....  they served me extremely well on my trip to Switzerland. I wore/accompanying me every day. I would look at the jacket, but the vest doesn’t breath at all. Since it’s a vest, the lack of arms allow for heat/moisture to escape. The full jacket would probably trap all body heat and moisture.",1
1,"This dress came poorly stitched, and is made of fabric like an umbrella. If you want a good laugh or plan on dancing in the rain, then go ahead and  order this dress.",0
5,"I was leary of this dress when I first ordered it. The price was too good to be true. It is very lightweight but so comfortable. I pair it with a jacket, sweater, vest when I wish to dress it up a bit. Because it is a solid color the choices are unlimited. It did come wrinkled but I used a warm iron to press it and it looks fine. I have not washed it so that will be the next test. I plan to wash in cold water and hang to dry. I ultimately ordered it in 3 colors...",1
2,washed in cold water and dried at low and they shrunk at least one size!!,0
2,I ended up returning these. The fit was very awkward and the straps were too short to go across my son's feet.,0
1,Just doesn’t look sane as the model. If ur skinny? Might look brttetx Hsu to return it,0
3,Very flimsy. Does the job but I don’t see them lasting very long.,0
1,The earrings were not included. There was an empty plastic package labeled “earrings” but there were no earrings inside,0
1,These were pretty junky when they came in. The stings were wiggly and extremely long. Returned.,0
1,Too tight and itchy,0
3,"The design part does not sit properly on the ring. One side is higher off the ring than the other. Also, the prongs holding the stone make it look cheap. I worried about that when I placed the order, but decided to give it a try.",0
2,Wore it to a wedding and by the end of the night under my armpits were ripped because the sequence would rub against each other strings were coming out so annoying,0
1,It come broken and returned it & never get the glass back or my money,0
5,Love these shoes for my kid. Daycare approved and stylish.,1
5,dope,1
1,Wish the words were on the outer part of the bracelet,0
5,"This dress hides all my bumps and large arms, I love it, the perfect length, I’m 4” 11’ (won’t say my weight)<br />I love it, front shows a little more than I wanted,  it wore a cami underneath.",1
5,Soft and Comfortable!,1
1,"Way to big !! This watch was not made to fit a woman's wrist. It is off round and very heavy and chunky, to the point of being gawkey looking. Also, this watch does not come in a gift box or a velvet bag, It came in unsealed plastic bag inside a cardboard box.<br />On a positive note, shipping is very fast !",0
5,Simply put I like them.,1
1,The length of the bar is way too short. The piece screws inside of the gauge part itself making it even smaller & too tight to wear. Other than that they are cute but def wouldn’t recommend if your ears swell sometimes,0
1,Super bummed seem was all messed up. Scrunched in areas,0
5,"Speakers sound good.  Warm,  durable.  Accidentally washed it with speakers still in it,  and they still sound great!",1
1,These rings are very small I gAve them to my 5 year old daughter .,0
5,love it,1
3,A little long but  had it hemmed above the knee and looks great,0
5,"I'm 5'5 140lbs I ordered a medium and it was a bit baggy in the legs, but it fit comfortably in the waist. I read a bunch of reviews prior and I am happy I bought a medium.",1
5,"This are really nice. They do look real and the silver is a real nice silver. I always buy the silver earings at walmart aince its a little chwaper and look nice, but this are a little more expensive but looks way better and the quality is wayyy superior.",1
5,I have really enjoyed my bag so far.  I have not had it for very long and am still trying to figure out what all I want to try to carry in it on a daily basis.  I have had complements on it and that always makes a girl feel good.,1
2,It's too big to wear as a pendent so I just tuck it in my bra.,0
5,Super cute- refined and came in a well put together packaging that made it all special,1
1,"I wouldn't recommend this. I bought it wear with a dress I bought for a ball. It kept falling off. If you sweat at all, it will fall.",0
5,wonderful pendant - just what i needed to put in the car so i can still take my most trusted companion along where ever i go.,1
3,"Picked up this little beauty for my honey for Christmas. I know she prefers smaller bags to full sized ones. She likes darker colors with leather being one of her favorites. This little bag has so much potential but has a few not so great points that caused it to be passed on. It arrives flattened out with a bar of foam the bag bottom is wrapped around. Not a big issue but don't usually like it when an item is distorted by packaging. This handbag feels wonderful to the touch, your hands will love the supple softness. The front of the bag has two zippered compartments. The zipper grippers are really pretty and well made. The zippers themselves are large and shiny silver with the very smoothest pull. Sadly the zippers on top, the rear and inside the bag are plastic and not nearly as nice-so what happened? The inside of the purse is very basic without frills, the storage compartments are just that. Minimal extra pockets or compartments inside. Again, not an issue. But the shoulder strap is seatbelt material, like out of your car. I like the clips on the ends of the strap. But the strap should have been leather too. Not a loser by any means but passed on by my wife. I will have no problem gifting this out to a friend.",0
1,Broke 2 weeks after purchasing.,0
3,"This dress is very beautiful however I ordered a Large, even though I'm a medium, and the top part is way too small for a 38D cup... unfortunately I wont be able to wear it, but I'll keep it to give it as a gift to someone with a smaller top size... otherwise I would have given this 5 stars :)",0
2,"I was impatient to receive it, but what I got was too tight, returned it as I have received it. Although I have a prime membership, but I had to pay for the return postage, they might reimburse me later for it. The only thing I like about it is the hat band.",0
1,Very poorly made! The lining doesn't match the outside of the bag so it puckers and won't stand up. Had to return. Bottom looks NOTHING like the pix!!,0
3,This was a bit too short for my 5'9 legs. It was nice light weight fabric.,0
5,Love these leggings!  Perfect fit and super comfy. Will be buying more.,1
3,"I should have read the reviews. This IS false advertisement. The only reason I purchased these were for the plastic post. THEY ARE SUPER CUTE THOUGH!<br />Most of the earing came broken since they were not shipped in a sturdy box. I'm keeping them just because they were already broken off the cheap metal post, so I was able to glue them onto plastic posts myself.",0
4,"was too small for me, but I gave it to my girlfriend at the time and she liked it.",1
4,The dress looks like the picture. The only thing is that it's a little sheer. The material looks like linen.,1
5,I work out in the yard a lot and this covers my entire head /neck and offers plenty of protection for my face as well... which is a huge bonus ! It washes up and retains its shape well. I love it... Whish I had it in several colors!,1
5,I love the look and function of the watch.  Excellent for the price.,1
5,My 10 year old son used the larger of the two bands that it came with. The band is comfortable and doesnt come loose. The black band looks slick with the black face on the watch,1
1,Bad quality,0
5,Excellent. Will purchase another.,1
5,"My kid loves it, easy to use.",1
1,Cheaply made quality shoe.,0
4,Very nice very  versatile!,1
1,It broke first day,0
5,"Very easy to use, great for going to the bathroom, looks good with outfits.",1
5,Stylish comfortable and accurate In sizing.,1
4,"This is super cute.  It fits my ""thicker"" middle easily, with plenty of room to spare.  And it is well made and makes lots of noise when on.  Although some reviewers said it stunk, I did not have that experience.  As with anything stored in a plastic bag, it had that plastic bag smell, but within minutes I did not smell it anymore.  It was shipped quickly and packaged nicely.  It was well worth the money.",1
2,It looked like a warmer hat from the pictures but it is a good size fall hat.,0
5,I love them just too big for my hands,1
5,"A very pretty cover up. I used this while on vacation. I was a little cautious because I am plus size. However, it does the job and looks good.",1
5,"Es un poco grande toca pedir una talla menos, pero es lindo",1
3,"The necklace looks just as pictured but it, it is HUGE!!!  LOL. . . . That said, I suppose it is just what many will want, but not so much for me.  The biggest problem I found with it is that the chain part of the necklace is not smooth and feels uncomfortable next to the skin. If you are wearing it on top of a fabric it would probably be OK, but for me not a good choice if the neckline is below it.",0
4,"I am petite, 5’1 and 115lbs.  I bought the small pack to wear under my scrubs in the winter.  They are baggy in the arms and are super long.  You might want to skip these if you are petite as well.",1
2,"This bracelet is pretty but stiff and came with a ""kink"" in it. I returned it because of the kink & didn't reorder because I was fearful another would kink too.",0
2,Not same size inside package. Every second one is smaller with a full size. From 5 pc are 3pc real size-2pc small size. And the quality is very cheap. knitted very lazy thread which gibes you large holes when socks are worn.,0
1,I ordered it because the jacket looked cool. I ordered 2 sizes larger than myself and still received a jacket that was 2 sizes too small. I am a large person. Only get this if you are a small to medium. Even then order bigger than what you think you should.,0
5,Second pair I've brought. Very good fit and perfect for cycling. Recommend these glasses for one and for all. Will but all glasses from here from now on...,1
5,Í love ir so much,1
5,Love Em! They look great on!,1
3,"This is a nice simple dress for the price. Good quality. Just a minor disappointment- based on the other Miusol dress I purchased which was a perfect fit, I went with the medium but it runs big particularly in the bust and shoulder areas. I'll have to do some alterations for it to fit perfectly. I'm 5'5 and approximately 135 lbs. It hits just below the knee.",0
5,Very well made costume! My husband was the evil queen and I was Snow White!  He was hilarious!,1
5,The workmanship and quality are very good. I really like the padded straps! So comfortable.,1
3,After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes up and it was still too small.,0
4,"Nice bracelet, a little sharp on the edges. One of my favorite quotes.",1
2,"Make sure you look at the size guide and measurements. The sizes are way off. The material is not soft and very thin. Yes it is meant to be flowy, but it is very stiff and almost feels like crepe paper. Not sure why I even tried this piece, not up to a good Quality Standard.",0
5,"Very strong my scalp feels mints when I have it on,by now I love it ..... very happy customer :)",1
5,"Just as pictured, fast shipping and great price for part of my Halloween costume!",1
2,Doesn’t fit well at all. Constantly slipping down 😏,0
3,"My stars, this is a very unusual garment! The fabric is a slick, thick, noisy, stretchy, heavy... I wanna say canvas. Except it's stretchy in each direction. It's weird. It reminds me of the girdles my mom used to wear in the 1960s.<br />The tacky buttons on the sleeves have gotta go, but it's easy enough to find some beautiful, less obtrusive buttons to replace them with.<br />I need to lose a little more weight before I'll be happy with the way it fits. It would be unfair for me to judge the fit at this point.  The bizarre inverted pleats in the center front and the center back pop and protrude like crazy if you have any trunk at all, let alone if you have any junk in it. I hope they'll lay flatter when I'm closer to my goal weight.<br />Despite all the above misgivings, I have high hopes for this dress. It will be warm in winter with such heavy fabric. The beautiful deep blue looks striking with a rhinestone starburst brooch I have, like a night sky. This dress shouldn't be over- accessorized (should anything?) because with such unusual tailoring, insets, pleats, etc. it can become cluttered looking pretty quick. I might get a crinoline petticoat to fluff out the makes-a-girl-wanna-twirl skirt a little.<br />I'll edit this review when I fit into the dress a little better if it changes what I think.",0
5,"Nicely made masks. Both my husband and I wear them. Love the fact they come with filters. If you have to wear one, I suggest these. Washes nice.",1
1,This is a very cheap and low quality shoe. Family dollar shoes are a better quality than these. Material is cheap and feels like paper with fuzz on it. The shoe was a little too big as well.  I tried the shoe on and took two steps forward and the heel broke completely off. This is a beautiful shoe but bad product to buy. Don’t waste your time. This is a thumbs 👎down for me.,0
1,"material used is garbage!!  ripped along cargo pocket and completely up and down leg, the first day wearing them!  Do not waste your money!!!",0
5,"Love this sweater!  It fits great, true to size XXL for me with a 42” H bust.  Nice bright colors to combat the fullness of winter. Great fit.",1
5,my 3yo looks good in this. I ordered a 3t and fits right.<br />the material is light so it's perfect for summer.,1
1,"Incredibly small, despite consulting the size chart",0
3,I ordered a size larger than my size and it fits as if i ordered a small for a teen. Had to gift it out to another person. But very pretty garment.,0
5,"I looked everywhere for a pair of combat boots that fit my budget and I am glad I found these. They are not the best material in the world and wouldn't hold up to real combat but for fashion they can't be beat. Plus the are one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own, I also love the easy zip up side.",1
1,"It's garbage. Super thin...like paper thin...and not a sweater at all. It's not even tee shirt material. I  honestly have cleaning rags thicker than this sweater. On top of that, it's about three sizes too small. If you want it to drape like it does in the image, put it on a toddler.",0
5,Love this shirt. I had shoulder surgery and it came in very handy when it came to moist surgery needs. I continue to use it during my  Physical Therapy sessions. I get slot of comments about the shirt! I plan on wearing it again when I have the opposite shoulder surgery scheduled in a few months.,1
5,The item was awesome and looks great on my husband. He loved it and it definitely made his birthday special.,1
5,Comfortable fit. It is delicate but fairly sturdy. I wear the toe ring when I shower. I take it off when I use the pool or hot tub.  Past experience with toe rings has been loss of shine. I don’t want to take any chances.,1
1,"The color and the fabric on the bottom is frightening, is completely different that the picture. I'm disappointed<br />and the size is bigger that the list of size in the picture, In conclusion I hate it, I waited for it 4 weeks and is horrible",0
5,Absolutely LOVE this dress! I received so many compliments on it and it was very well made - especially for the price!,1
2,Chain came tangled . Impossible to untangle. Second one Chain broke so easy,0
2,The robe fits great and is very soft however I'm diappointed it the color I ordered a red one for my dude and I now have to give him an orange one. Ugh.,0
3,"There was a rhinestone missing when received item, not to happy about that. Other than that problem it’s beautiful!! If wasn’t missing a diamond I would have given 5 stars",0
3,I thought it had pockets but there are only fake flaps.,0
2,This bra and panties set is pretty but picture buying it for a very very small person. The bra is very padded and the panties are high wasted which the description and photos don't portray.,0
1,"Instead of the small black kitten mask I ordered, I received an adult mask with a picture of a drunk bunny holding two glasses of beer. The mask was supposed to be for my 4 year old daughter. I can’t give her this.",0
2,I liked the variety of colors but unfortunately they don't really hold very well. I used them for face masks. It gets annoying when you have to adjust constantly.,0
1,"I did NOT get my product!  It was not in the package with everything else!  Very disappointed, this was for my son who is leaving for college in a month.",0
1,Poorly put together. Lots of lumps. Looked terrible under the dress. Took LOTS of work to make it look acceptable.,0
1,To small to tight to hard to get on. 2 1/2 hrs to get on. Elastic band  at top was so tight created a 1/2 deep depression all the way around the top part of my leg.,0
4,This is huge!!! I am  medium so I ordered a medium and I could honestly wear it as a dress. Order this 2 sizes smaller or any size smaller than what you would usually wear.,1
1,Quit working after a few months and the wrist band did not<br />hold up at all.,0
4,I got a small and it fit perfectly. It was flesh against my skin with no gaps or excess fabric. Great fit.,1
3,"Too small and tight, unable to get it on my foot.",0
5,Great material for just about any weather condition. Fits well and pairs rather impressively with a nice pair of suspenders,1
5,Super cute! I managed to wrangle my 36H cup titties into this top (112cm). Honestly I own 2 of these now in case one dies some day.,1
3,"The sweatshirt is extremely comfortable and fits as expected but, after a few weeks of wearing it the writing faded off a lot!!",0
5,Really cute!,1
5,Been wearing it for 6 months now and it's crazy durable.,1
1,Did not work. No improvement at all,0
3,"The sizing is different when purchasing from Amazon than when you purchase in a store… making it difficult to choose the proper size. My daughter is ten, very tall and very skinny.  Im now trying the 10-12 because the 8-10 was way too small. For reference leggings in a size ten are loose around the waist and short in length. Her clothing size is about an 8 kids.",0
1,Didn’t fit the blaze at all. Returned immediately,0
1,"I can't even give one star but to leave a comment I do not have a choice. The purse did not last two weeks of use! One strap came off, the brackets are pulling away with edges that are so sharp that when I attempted to fix the bracket it cut my finger. So not happy!",0
1,Just awful,0
5,Bigger than expected.,1
1,I really like - my glasses don't fog up. Very comfortable.,0
5,"Light and pretty sturdy. Very trendy too, classic. I'd buy another pair!",1
3,"The fabric is a little stiff and also a little thin. You could clearly see underwear lines and there was a swish/swish noise when walking.<br />That said, these were surprisingly comfortable. The stiffness/noise might go away with washing (that's likely, in fact) and the line issue could be different or better with a variant in a darker color.",0
5,Looks absolutely fantastic. Cant wait to wear it!,1
5,"I bought this as a gift.  I don't know what brands are hot and which are out.  Nor do I know what styles are in.  After getting suggestions for Kate Spade, I found a style that I thought would fit my niece's new job.  She loves it!  This one seems expensive to me, but women I know say I got a great price.",1
5,Took my boys to their first Monster truck show and I think these headset muffled the noise quite well.,1
5,"Bought this for my daughters grade school luau dance. The dress was flowing and beautiful.  Very attractive dress, well made. We really liked the top portion of the dress, how it was able to fit a smaller upper frame without falling down.",1
4,Beautiful shoe,1
3,Only problem i have is that the color they display is not true. The image shows the sweater is actually gray at the top (it was advertised online as a minty green)<br />Overall the sweater fits great and feels comfy. Just gave 3 stars because i really wanted that mint green color combo 🤷‍♀️,0
2,"The truck prints look old, faded and pixelated. Was not worth the price.",0
3,"Looks cheap close up. Will keep for fall time outings or last minute meetings. Very wrinkle prone. Loved the styling and idea but it's basically an open shirt thing. Not a blazer, not even close.",0
4,"You get whats expected. Just the bronze/gold sort of wears off but doesn't look TOO bad, but still noticeable. Cute cheap bundle of rings. (i received all the rings, except i gave two to a friend)",1
3,"I wanted to love this swimsuit, but the top was WAY too small and did not seem at all consistent with the size of the bottom. I'm 5&#34;4', 34D bra, 26&#34; waist, and 40&#34; hips. I ordered this in XL based on the other reviewers' comments and the size chart in the description. The bottom fit fine, but the top was so tight that it was both uncomfortable and unattractive. I had to return, but I'm sure this would look cute on someone with different proportions.",0
5,Loved the suit!! Son wore it to his 8th grade dance!,1
5,Wore this dress to an outdoor wedding. It was very comfortable and breathable great fabric. Color. was spot on in photos and true to size. The lace pattern carries just enough elegance to be worn to a wedding or casual gathering. You’ll love this dress!,1
2,"I was pleased with the vivid colors and the creative flair on these skirts.  But two of the three had visible stains on the fabric.  One had a dark red stain on the belt tie, similar to a wine stain.  The other appeared to have a grease stain on the front of the skirt.  I had purchased them for and had them sent to my mother, who lives in another state. By the time I saw them in person, it was too late to return them. I threw them away. Very disappointed that an Amazon vendor would sell stained clothing to US customers - and think it is acceptable.  Buyer beware.",0
5,Love the jumper. It looks so good on.,1
2,on the small side - didn't care for the pockets either - it would be cute on someone else,0
5,With quality and with a reasonable price.,1
4,Decent price,1
5,Love this!,1
5,exactly what i was looking for. fits comfortably and feels thick enough to be protective while still allowing for easy breathing. would highly recommend.,1
1,"Really nice looking watch, great color but the clamp does not stay shut, just falls off. and I waited too long to return it, so i'm stuck with it. :(",0
5,I ordered this dress quickly from Amazon and loved it.  It fits perfectly and is great for the price.,1
2,Beautiful  dress and fabric. Not true to size.,0
1,This shirt traps your sweat...and I would say that this shirt is very true to size. I ordered a medium and it ended up being too big. The crop length is great but the high neck is way too small of a hole to get your head in.,0
3,"This is a cool idea, and is good for traveling but don't find it's use to be so efficient. I don't know, maybe I need more time.",0
5,cool,1
1,"I don't think this is an official ST shirt. I recieved it and immediately washed with my other new shirts. After drying, I inspected all of my new shirts and was a bit disappointed with this one. After one wash it looks like I've had it for years with worn away and cracking ink. Even the tagless tag is super faded. Don't buy unless you're okay with a solid black shirt because a few more washes and that's probably what I'll have...",0
3,Very cute and true to size but not the greatest quality. Very thin material.,0
5,Great as described,1
1,Way to dark even for Arizona,0
5,"My mom and I have always been best friends. She recently had a hospital stay and is due to get surgery in a month. I got this as a present for her to wear as a reminder we will still be together, even though we will be apart, during her hospital stay. We already wear them everyday. The heart fits into the other heart. They’re beautiful and easy to use, also comfortable to wear",1
5,Love how soft this is! Got a medium and it fits great. Not too tight.,1
1,ordered an 8.5 which is my usually size and it was way too small never sent back due to them wanting me to pay like $24.00 to send it bak why pay the same amount of shoe to send back for a bigger size.<br /><br />NO GOOD,0
2,Flimsier than it looks in the pics. Also colour not as per picture - Lighter shade. I'm not sure I'll be wearing it.,0
5,I love the look of this bag. I have not used it yet. It's a nice size.,1
5,"This dress is perfect for just about everything from running errands, heading to work (i wear a shawl over it), or long hours at school. It's also great for just wearing around the house, and if you dress it up a little with some jewelry it's great for lunches and dinners, or your children's events.<br /><br />For reference, I bought the XL as I am 5'6&#34;, 31 waist, 38G cup. I saw a lot of reviews saying the top wouldn't fit a larger busted woman but here I am, wearing it now, with no bust-related problems and the straps, which are adjustable, are very comfortable in helping hold the material so it flows. The dress is made of chiffon with a mid-length liner, and the pockets are cleverly sewn in so as not to interrupt the look of the dress. As for length, this hits me just below my ankles so I can wear just about any shoe with it (No lie, I have worn my adidas and a pair of boots with it).<br /><br />This shipped very quickly--it was 5 days ahead of schedule--coming from China. It was packaged well and there was no scent of any kind.<br /><br />There were no instructions on how to wash this dress, but being chiffon I figured hand wash would be the best...but who has time for that anymore? If you have a hand wash cycle on your dryer, I'd say use that and hang up to dry. You'll want to put the dress in a lingerie bag to wash it so that the washing machine doesn't catch it on something during the cycle. I did this and used woolite and the dress looks great. If you don't have a hand wash cycle on the washer, go ahead and use the gentle cycle but again, put it in a lingerie bag to keep it from damage.<br /><br />I wore this one day after it arrived and got several compliments from people I don't even know! It's a great dress at a great price, and as I always say, follow your intuition when it comes to what will fit you.<br /><br />I will note, though I had no issues with wanting to return this dress, I encourage everyone to read every seller's refund policy, located at the bottom of their ratings page.",1
5,I loved the picture. It was a present for a friend she liked it so much she said she was going to wear it insideout so he would be even closer. Haha,1
5,Perfect for the beach. Loved the option of a high bun or regular ponytail. Fit was perfect. Stylish!,1
5,"Really sharp,",1
5,Really liked,1
1,"The shirt was way too little. I normally wear a 1X, so I ordered a 1X it was too little and then I ordered a 2Xl and it was too little also. The 2 shirts where about the same fit. Very disappointed. I had to send both back for a refund.",0
3,"Have 4 of these, in small and medium - not a significant difference. I took the darts out, didn’t want fitted flannel shirts. The weight is nice, not to thin and flimsy; and construction is nice too. I wash carefully-no fading, no shrinking- My only complaint is after 4 washes they have begun to pill and that makes any fabric look bad -I have old flannel that never pilled. I am over 70 so I have some OLD flannel shirts... that still look good. I would be upset if I had paid full price!",0
2,"These socks are cute and fit well. I will be returning them however, because the inside of the socks look and feel like the patterns had been darned into the fabric! The threads are exposed which created an incredibly uncomfortable feel against my foot and ankle. I have never seen socks manufactured like this before. Very disappointed!",0
5,"My favorite purse of all times.  I love the color, the size, and everything about it.  I get tons of compliments on this purse.",1
4,"Great size, pattern and fabric. However, the key chain fob part isn't gold, it's silver. In the description, it said it'd be gold so I had different expectations. However, it doesn't change the usefulness of the product.",1
1,Worst ever.  No support and runs small.  Hate these!,0
5,Husband loved product wears frequenltly,1
5,Great product!!,1
3,Elegant but fragile :/,0
5,"Super soft and comfortable. I 5'4 and it is tunic length on me. EXACTLY what I wanted. Love the fabric, its a soft cotton. I am ordering another!",1
4,Fits me perfectly.  Not too high of a heel and comfortable after standing and walking the majority of the day.,1
2,B's and under only.,0
2,"Reviews stated that it ran small, so I ordered a size larger than I would normally wear and it is still too small!!! Not happy with the product, I really thought this was cute too, but i cant wear it!",0
1,I bought the two piece black and white - the material is nice but it is poorly made. It came loose from the stitches in the back the first time I wore it. Thank God it was in a family Thanksgiving dinner but it was still embarrassing. Not worth the one star.,0
1,Not a sweatshirt!! Not cotton. Way undersized!!,0
3,"This shirt is cute. It is made out of a very thin material (but in Florida that's perfect). PROBLEM: I'm 5'3"" and this shirt is so long (not just in the back with the high/low style but in the front also). It looked like I was wearing a dress!!! Petite sizes are NOT offered in women's sizes, so you have no choice. The actual size of the shirt was good. Returns are NOT free with this company. I'm really disappointed. Due to being charged for return shipping, I will not purchase from this company again.",0
4,"For people complaining about the size -- read the description. It's a big messenger bag sized purse. But it lies flat and is lightweight and looks good even when there is barely anything inside. It's a bigger purse than I need, so I use all that extra room sometimes for a book or my ipad or something I wouldn't normally be able to carry.<br />No, it's not leather.<br />Be prepared for strap to break, either coming undone where it's folded, and/or the piece glued to the purse pulling away entirely. I fixed mine with a few stitches, as the purse is so soft a needle goes right through. I love this purse, so it was worth fixing. Kids smile and point at this purse, and people with Bostons will walk from a block away to talk about it.<br /><br />I had one of these purses for 3 years and replaced it as the pocket began to fray and paint was peeling. The second purse also broke away at the strap and had to be prepared, which is annoying but expected for $14. BUT the second purse had a zipper sewn completely wrong inside, which I didn't notice till later -- had I noticed sooner I would have returned to see if it was just my purse or an ongoing flaw.",1
5,LOVE this dress!!! Super cute and flattering. I am 5’4 130 lbs and got a Medium. I paired it with a jean jacket around my waist. super cute!!! Want in every color. Love how the straps are adjustable and has pockets!,1
3,sits much higher on the waist then the picture shows and they are boot cut not skinny jeans.,0
5,I like the bag because it has a lot of great pockets for organization.,1
5,"These glasses are patriotic AF! If you are looking for a cool pair of cheap &#34;wayfarer&#34; style sunglasses while also displaying love for your country look no further. These glasses come in many varieties of countries so choose what is for you, I naturally chose USA! Greatest Country in the World! These would be great all year around but especially awesome for a sweet July 4th celebration. These have UV 400 protection and do provide a nice shade and keep the eyes nice and protected. They are not polarized but I didn't want that so no biggie for me. They are cheap and about the quality you would expect from your average gas station sun glasses, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There is a time and place for cheap sun glasses and I think these would surpass any expectations that you would have for them. While cheap they do feel to be well made. I do recommend these sunglasses and have received many compliments on them.<br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
5,"they do the job they were bought for, seem well made and did not have any issues using them",1
5,"This tee shirt is super fun!  Bought for my teenaged son, this shirt is soft, fits comfortable and is well made.  I have washed it several times and the picture has held up perfectly.",1
1,"The dress was beautiful, however it was too small.",0
4,Material is not ripstop like I thought it would be.  Let's see if they hold out.,1
5,Great value,1
5,"I got this to augment my USMC ECWS and it was so much better I shelved it.  It is heavy, but a all in one modular system to keep you warm and dry.  The only drawback is the hood does not rollup out of the way to act as a padded collar.  I bought it to the size stated and it is designed to cover even cold weather clothes you are wearing.  If to wear over a t-shirt or light clothing get one size ot two sizes smaller.",1
1,Loved this watch for the first three years I owned it...then the “glow in the dark/easy to read” numbers started drying up and falling to the bottom of the crystal case.  Contacted Luminox and was told it was a common issue but my watch was outside warranty.  Would love to buy again but just do not sequentially buy “expensive” replacements every 3 years.,0
1,"Did I order a garbage bag? Because I'm pretty sure that's what this is made of. The fit was ok, but the material is SO THIN",0
5,Love these pants.  Very comfortable and fits just right.  Totally recommend them. Received lots of compliments.,1
5,This evil eye necklace is so beautiful!! It looks really expensive but it wasn’t! Really shiny and sparkly! I love it! Highly recommend!!!,1
4,This waist and thigh trainer definitely gives you a sweat during a workout. The trainer is pink and black. The trainer can be worn on top of yours clothes or underneath. The trainer did have a smell out of the package. The smell was a really strong rubber or chemical smell. However I like the product and it does the job and make you sweat. The sizing was accurate.,1
3,"I'm 5'2"" the coat does NOT cover my hips! I wanted it for the winter months! Iordered 2 sizes up and fits ok. Not real impressed!! The colors are nice, the lining does not fit properly! Im a sewist and this coat was poorly constructed! Generally unhappy with my purchase!! Slow shipping!",0
3,Arrived with many pieces disconnected and possibly a few missing.  This is cheaply made but still very attractive.  Be prepared to do some repair and upkeep and make some decisions about where you want to put pieces once/if some are or go missing.  The part closest to the neck doesn't sit quite right.  The arc of the pieces doesnt fit the way they are strung together causing a strange fit that doesn't quite want to lay properly on the neck or chest.  You get what you pay for.,0
5,Good material and perfect fit!,1
2,"I loved the dress, fit perfect. The o Lt problem was that I wore it once and the zipper split and now I have to have the zipper replaced. Disappointed to say the least",0
2,Not well put together- strings hanging off everywhere after washing. Not very warm.,0
1,The firefighter charm is very small..<br />Cant see the lettering or the symbol.,0
1,Horrific fit product and material please don’t do it my gap was not even that big🤦🏻‍♀️,0
5,"I needed a dress for an up-coming wedding. I didn’t think this would be much for the price. Amazon recommended I get an extra large, I did. The colors are deep and vibrant. The sleeves are perfect length. The dress length is perfect. I love the discreet pockets. For $25.00 it’s a true bargain!  Fabric is nice too....",1
5,So far so good..... I had lasik surgery earlier in the year and the glare at night has really been bothering me so I went looking for some glasses to help me see. These glasses have actually made a big difference. It reduces the glare dramatically of brake lights and bright lights in general. Ive also used them to ride my bike during the day and night and they work great!!! Would definitely recommend them,1
1,Arrived w black stripes and blue floral. Fit was true to size.,0
1,Junk,0
5,Cute little dress up shoes. So adorable with just about any outfit we try them with. The quality of material and craftsmanship is great. These are great for new walkers and easy to put on and take off. We recommend these adorable little shoes as well as the brand.<br /><br />We received these for a discount in exchange for an honest review.,1
5,Nice length for leggings,1
1,Wasn’t made for people that have hips or thighs,0
5,These feel like heavy designer sunglasses. These are cute!,1
4,I have received many compliments on this suit! Love it!,1
5,Love it,1
5,"beautiful skirt, the color the design looks gorgeous!!!",1
1,"This is scratchy,bulky is not this gorgeous turquoise color but a disgusting kelly green. I do not like Kelly green esp .with my coloring. The texture and weave look nothing like the picture. I will be sending this back. It does seem warm  but if you  want what you see in Picture you may be greatly disappointed. And not sure what the other colors really are be cause mine was 100% not this color I ordered.There is also what appears to be a mistake in weave around the neck! Sad as I was really looking forward to a nice sweater in this cold weather.",0
5,My grand daughter loves her ear rings. These stay on nicely without pinching her!<br />She's 3 years old.,1
5,Love these socks!,1
4,"Works as advertised.  However, the pump action is not efficient and difficult to use.",1
3,Order this once and it was amazing. Wear for work. Uniformish at a spa. Ordered a second one and it was a completely different fit and stiffer material. Bummer. Would love to order another one like the first one. But don't know what you're going to get,0
5,Absolutely loved this dress,1
2,No support might as well go barefooted. Probably better for the beach and not a water park. I didn't order from the link my daughter sent me and hers were so much better,0
4,"I love the quality of these stone plugs. Beautiful crystals and color. The only thing I would change is that the single flares don't have a groove where the O- Ring could rest so it won't accidentally slide off. But that's the only thing, great 2 gauge plugs otherwise.",1
5,"Loose fitting, husband states 10/10",1
5,These boots keep getting better looking the more they are worn. These are exactly what I was looking for.,1
1,It’s my second day using this and it’s already leaving paint on my neck it is super fake don’t waste your money,0
1,"Like the design, need more larger sizes (US), and “MUST” offer an easier return policy.",0
5,"Nice shirt, I like that it's actually two layers and not just a fake two layers. If you were to peel up one of the Ruffles there's a whole nother layer of cloth for the bottom ruffle. Very soft material too",1
1,Painfully stiff and poorly made. The material feels like a steel toe box and the laces are a challenge to loosen and tighten to take shoes on and off. Wish I read the negative reviews on all of the other sites before purchasing. This brand Louise et Cie is tres mal.,0
1,Really cheap.  Color bleeds on everything when wet.  And do NOT wash with other clothes...ruined other clothes.  Too small.  Hurts to pull over head.  Fills with air in the pool and creates big air bubbles in the shoulders.  I cant say enough bad things.  Wish I would not have bought this.,0
4,Good fit,1
1,This broke the 1st time I wore it.,0
5,"Excelente, reloj luce bien y llegó mucho antes de lo que dijeron.",1
5,"Really cute, thinking of ordering again in the other colors available.",1
5,Best Buy for your money.,1
2,"The product was ok and came in adequate packaging. However, my son wore this with no worries the first time and on taking it off, the magnet to the front piece came off. So now I have to glue this back on to be able to use again. Not worth the price.",0
5,"I love this dress. It's both elegant and sexy. I normally have a hard time finding a dress that fits just right, but this one stretches nicely.",1
1,I ordered the color pictured (black top/tortoise bottom) and was sent a brown frame color instead which looks almost burgundy in sunlight and is  cheap looking in my opinion. The frames are sturdy overall but this color is just so bad and the finish almost looks like it’s coming off in some areas. Not worth it to return these shipping internationally so it’s disappointing. I would have absolutely loved these if they had just sent me the right color.,0
5,barely know it is on my hand. awesome.,1
2,"zipper was broken, it wouldnt go up and I am thin so it wasnt my weight.. it would have looked nice otherwise, kinda cheap looking, but you can make it work if you try.",0
1,Too short to ears for men.  Not snug on air circ.  Warning comes with that not medically approved.,0
5,Purchased it as a gift for my PT.  It wS beautiful.,1
1,Missing a leg extension. No way to contact seller. Nothing worse that getting something for your kid on her birthday and she can't enjoy because SOMEONE didn't make sure all the parts were in the box.,0
3,I like the dress however it is a little longer than I expected. Probably just going to hemm it a little and it shoukd be fine.,0
5,It really was accurate to order 1 size smaller.  Also perfect length.,1
3,"I bought these to wear during the holidays and got several complements on them. They are fun and fit my 5.5 foot just fine. They are not of a very high quality, which I expected and didn't mind since I wear them seasonally and only paid the sale price for them. They are more of a Payless shoe quality and there is no support or padding. I would never pay full price ($90) for them. I'd give them 3 stars for quality and 5 for &#34;what I was looking for&#34; in a fun shoe. They shipped directly from China and arrived earlier than suggested. Yeah, just in time for the holidays. 😊",0
4,Get lots of complements.,1
2,The quality of the metal is good but mine came with missing stones,0
5,Very comfortable. Very durable. Easy to install,1
3,"Each time you need to press the button screen will be bright, 2 seconds after the black screen, you need to keep the button, which is particularly bad design. Looks like a toy watch.",0
5,My daughter loved them!,1
1,Bought this for my mother-in-law for her birthday yesterday. Took the teal one out of the package to change her band on her Apple Watch for her and the black lock in mechanism broke right away rendering the teal band unusable. Disappointing!!,0
2,"The fabric is cozy- but the pants are weirdly short- and the hoodie is large enough for two people to wear at the same time- it’s not “roomy” the hoodie is exceedingly large- if the set fit well- would be cozy, but not something to wear to lounge in,.. low price, but you can easily find a better purchase",0
5,"Bought this for work. It looks professional, is so comfortable and flattering, I love it",1
4,Best bet for the collecto,1
5,I buy these for all new moms. Cute and absorbent!,1
5,My son get this with his own money and loves it.,1
5,My grandson pulled this out of the relatively small packaging and was in the fully inflated costume in under five minutes.  This was a great COVID friendly costume as he was in a sort of a bubble.,1
3,"I was really happy with these at first. The colors were good and the fabric appeared to be good quality. However, after one wash the fabric started to frazzle and fray. Not overly impressed",0
2,"This a cool wallet, lots of pockets and everything fits in it. However, the downside is a biggie: the money clip is so strong that it<br />makes removing items, like credit cards, almost impossible because the very strong pressure of the money clip. I struggled with<br />it every time and even dropped the wallet a few times. I thought maybe I might bent it to make it looser, but I thought that would ruin it. So I’m going to have to return it- and I’m bitter about it. So consider this before you buy.",0
5,One word: PERFECT!!!,1
4,These are good quality. Super cute. Very vibrant and detail is great. They're adorable.,1
1,"Got the bra today full of white streaks that look like deodorant marks. Hopefully they will wash away but upset that my ""new"" bra looks used",0
2,Rough feel around edges of the bracelet band.  Totally diminishes value.  Very dissapointed.  Usually I am very pleased with Kenneth Cole Watches..made this one feel like a black market knock-off?,0
5,"good color. good quality. last one i got from somewhere else, the color wore off so i got this new one. not sure how the durability will be but so far so good! hard to find big colored gauges anymore. will buy from again! hopefully they get some nice 2 gauges in by then.",1
1,"Material was a clingy knit,not waffle material ,as described.  It was very poor quality. The reviewers must have bought something else",0
5,"Had to reorder, but finally received correct item on second try. Seller was very cooperative.<br />Love the bag!  Just what I wanted!  It IS a buckle closer/NOT a faux buckle with magnet closure like some bags. Not red or burgundy, but rich color. No objectionable smell as other reviews have indicated. Very happy.",1
3,"Product returned in a bag it came in, sent back less than a week after received",0
3,Was good jacket. But had to return it because the front zipper was not working.,0
5,I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday. I loved it but the two tone isn't something he's ever gone for so I was a little nervous if he would like it. We own 20+ Nixon watches between the two of us. He absolutely loves this one. It looks even better in person. So happy with the purchase as always,1
4,"Bought for my daughter age 10. She normally wears a size 14 in children's clothing. These were a bit large but, they are stretchy and fit her comfortably. Leggings are soft and thick. Great for cold weather. I wear a size 6 jeans and believe these leggings would fit me.",1
1,"It's not real 925 silver, the little stones come off the more you wear it. I tried to cancel my order a total of six to eight times maybe more but it wasn't going through and that was a bit weird",0
1,These have to be a kid’s belt!!! Poor quality:(,0
5,Sleepshirt s like this is hard to find I love it true to size very comfortable and make you fell good about yourself,1
5,"It has a unique ticking mechanism, in which i like alot",1
3,"It is much more traffic cone orange than a cute burnt orange. Much more noticeable. Also strangely heavy for how thin it is, but a good spring/summer dress. With accessories it could be less shocking, or maybe another layer. Fulfills the modestly requirement for an event with scandalized auntie types though!",0
4,You get what you pay for,1
2,"I am a size 14 and figured the xl would be more than sufficient, but it was cut very tightly.",0
1,"It looks like Hugh Hefner pajamas, don't even think you can wear it to the club. I returned it immediately.",0
4,"They were a little bit smaller than I expected. But they still fit, and are pretty comfortable. I'd order a size bigger though. The pocket is nice too.",1
5,love it,1
3,the product was just ok over priced,0
5,Love them,1
5,Adorable. Daughter gets so much attention in these!,1
5,"These earrings are a definite good value, are excellent quality, the safety backs are a definite plus, good choice for men women or teens, easy to turn for piercing earrings, and are a very attractive style<br />I purchased these Stainless Steel 4mm Ball Piercing Earrings because of their lovely simplicity I also own these 4mm balls post earrings in 10K Yellow Gold, and Tinanium Blue as well as Purple - which are all very attractive. In fact I'm wearing all four pairs right now!<br /><br />I used 3mm versions of these piercing earrings which were very comfortable to wear in my cartilages for 12 weeks.When you decide to get cartilage piercings be sure you can live with the same earring for 12 weeks. Also make sure you chose a style that are easy to turn (which these are).<br />Whether you chose Yellow Gold, White Gold, Stainless Steel, Purple or Blue  4mm Ball Piercing Earrings you will be purchasing very stylish and comfortable earrings that make an excellent choice for long-time wear.",1
3,[[VIDEOID:e97980e8a6161f36c16336e69c84af27]] Video speaks for itself! Clearly both say medium on the tags and clearly they are not the same size! They sewed in the wrong tags in their sweatpants. No one knows any of the real sizes where you're buying these from! 😏🤪😂👎,0
1,Only lasted a month before they started to fall apart at the straps.,0
3,"This dress, while pretty, runs small in car chest area, also it is a little see through",0
3,"It edges are grey, not smooth or finished. Other than that its works.",0
3,Soft and easily to walk in for a while but not long term because the thong part that fits between your big toe is so thick it eventually becomes very uncomfortable,0
1,These could fit a 5 yr old maybe.,0
1,"Flimsy, this didn't last 6 months, a little tear turned into completely useless piece of once nice pajama bottoms",0
2,My feet got sweaty. Could see sides with my shoes and not enough support for Morton’s neuroma symptoms. For me didn’t work out and I didn’t keep them.,0
1,"Loved it the first time I wore it.  After washing put it in garbage all the fridge became knotted, what a mess. If you don't wash it, it would probably be fine.",0
1,I have tried this product and I barely bought it and the sparkler is coming off . Too cheap,0
5,"Nice buy. Very comfortable,  thick and secure. Great price.",1
1,"This was the worst idea I had, more than half of the lights did not work, the bands which held the lights to the fingers kept falling off, and the packaging looked like it went through the war, almost like it was water soaked. I was so embarrased I could not give to the children, I threw them away",0
1,Wasted my money,0
1,"To be fair, I didn't buy the mask from Amazon. Bought it directly from lululemon. It was DOUBLE STRAP FACE MASK *3 PACK Black/Black/Heritage 365 Camo Mini Deep Coal Multi and it cost only $28, so I'm here wondering if they did a cheap edition of this mask... it fits well, but it fogs my glasses, as it has no nose wires, and the seam in the middle that is supposed to keep the mask away from your mouth, works the opposite way, popping back on your mouth after you pull it away. Contacted lululemon for a return, but they said: no returns, no refunds.",0
5,"It took a long time to get to me, but it was worth the wait.  The necklace is beautiful and this is a bonus: I can put it on over my head.  My hands don't work very well now because I have Arthritis so trying to clasp a chain from behind my head is too hard.  This is important to me.  The length is perfect.  I may buy this for a gift.",1
3,Runs small.,0
1,Cheap cheap fabric.  Pattern looks like it was printed on.,0
2,"They don't seems brand new at all like said, they look faded and if you pull on the edges a little bit it's rips off. Not happy with them",0
5,"I love this dress, but be sure to size down!  I usually wear size 14 or 16. I bought the large and it fits great. Perfect for the beach or a hot day when you want to wear something loose.",1
4,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  The color is every bit as vibrant as the photos suggest and it looks much more expensive than it is.  I don't know why, but I was expecting it to be larger: it isn't quite small, but not really the statement piece of jewelry I was hoping for.  Regardless, I'm happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.",1
5,I love it do much that I ordered another one the next day,1
3,"Average tank top.  Good color, but a little snug.",0
5,"This was a gift for my brother, he works for a large business where he is expected to dress well and travel all over. When I saw this, I thought it would be perfect since we used to love playing Legos as kids. He loved it when he opened it, said it's perfect and a great conversation starter!",1
4,I like,1
5,nice cap as expected,1
1,Way too small. I even ordered up one size. Returned.,0
2,Adjusting and removing the pins from the links was very difficult. The little kit it came with was almost useless as some of the pins were so difficult to remove the tools bent.<br /><br />I had to use a dedicated watch kit to get it right. If you don’t have that as a backup look for something else or add the cost of a kit to this.<br /><br />All that being said my wife really likes it.,0
5,"I love it ,",1
4,"The detail and finish on this ring was better than I expected. The only thing I don't like is that it is hollow, but for the price, it's great.",1
5,"i run every day, i love running. I love running even more now because i don't need to worry about things falling out of my pocket because i have a running belt. Fits perfect and feels comfortable. can't feel it when running",1
4,"The masks work fine and the value is worth it but I bought these for my kids. They fit them but were a little small but not by much, the wife and I couldn't wear them but they were good for the kids.",1
5,nice!  very light weight.,1
5,Works great,1
3,"This Watch is a very GOOD looking Piece. I like it very much.<br />THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS NOT WORKING FROM DAY ONE. IT WONT EVEN START. I TRIED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.<br />I WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW WORKING ONE.<br />SO CAN U MAKE ARRANGEMENTS. I HAD WRITTEN TO THE SENDER, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION YET.",0
2,So they fit. As long as I didnt walk. There was no stretch to the material so the tops of my feet hurt right away. Cute style if you can handle the pain,0
5,"Great price, great quality",1
2,The item was small for a Large size and the quality was not the best.,0
3,"These are high quality and I love the colors, but the lot I recieved was completely missing the orange crystal and had an excess of dark blue. I'd been hoping to do one color each for the seven souls in the &#34;Undertale&#34; game: Can't do it without the orange &#34;Bravery&#34; spirit.",0
1,"I didn’t like the material, the dress was too loose not fitted at all like the pictures, doesn’t have a shape at all. Unless you have super large hips this dress is not form fitting at all.  Couldn’t return because didn’t have time, so I’m stock with it.",0
1,See through. Shorter than stated.,0
1,I used this product exactly as directed and it turned the fabric hard. They were super soft before I used this. Now they are rough to the touch. My sister learned from my mistake and has not applied anything to her Ugg’s. Three weeks after Christmas and my shoes look a year old. I want to cry. I used a regular spray on my old uggs held about a foot away and I never had a problem. This year my dad spent the extra money on their speacial cleaner/conditioner and I’ve never had a worse experience with Ugg’s or any shoes. This is my fifth pair. The only pair I’ve actually used their cleaner and the worst ones yet. And again. They are brand new. I just want to cry.,0
2,This is pretty and a good length but it constantly pulls the hair on the back of my neck which makes if very uncomfortable. I can't wear it the way it is.,0
4,First time buyer of this brand. Love the style and and softness. Sizing is a little off. I'm a size 11 and I ordered a 12 and they just barley fit me. I recommend them just make sure you go 2 sizes up. :),1
5,"LOVE these frames they are the perfect mix between FUN and classic aviator style. While the styling is classic Aviator I really prefer the thicker, sturdier styling of the metal frames and the Orange Mirrored lenses are quite eye catching and great for the beach.  I always receive compliments on the lenses and a couple of friends have asked for ordering information.  I own several different pairs/styles of sunglasses from Menton Ezil and have really come to count on the brand for quality eye wear.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to<br />evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using it.",1
1,It is see through.  No where in description diens it say the material is sheer.,0
3,Nice hat but I wish it was a little more poofy.,0
3,"My ears had a reaction when I left them in for days. Stainless Jewelry has never done this before. Both ear lobes have scabs now.  Other than that, seemed like decent jewelry.",0
5,Beautiful earrings.,1
5,"Great sunglasses! Loved my first pair so much, I ordered a second pair. Nice case and cleaning wipes that are very useful. The bamboo is nice looking and overall, a great unisex look. I am a woman and I feel they look great for male or female. Well constructed and very pleased with my sunglasses...... and great price!",1
4,Super cute dress. Great fit and material. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I think a waist tie or thin belt would have made it perfect.,1
3,"The style is classic. However, the cloth is not a great quality and it’s very wrinkled. The fit is okay but not proportional.",0
1,"Unfortunately, I did not like this product.  I had thought with it being a corset strapless that it would stay in place but it slides down continuously and offers no support.  The material is very pretty but uncomfortable and rough on my skin.",0
5,"Fit is a little large, but that's good for a sweatshirt. Love the stars!",1
5,Comfy slippers for my son,1
1,Doesn't really look like picture and is completely see through. I spent more on this dress than many others I have and it by far looks the cheapest. I am so disappointed and frustrated.,0
5,Love the fit! Wore it postpartum. Fit is great.,1
2,"Wish this style had some elastic in the back. It stretches out of shape and will not stay up. Colors were nice, but the band is not stretchy enough to stay up. I like the 3-seam turban from Hats With Heart much better. That brand has a little strip that is elasticized in the back and the medium/large in that style and brand fits my small head and offers some fullness.",0
3,Nice hat. It’s warm. I thought it was more of a snug fitting hat but it’s longer then the image appears. Nothing wrong with that but it’s not what I was expecting. I like the hats that fit to your head not that kind that have the reservoir tip. This defiantly has the reservoir tips 😂,0
4,It's nice for the price.,1
5,I really like the space I have in the bag love it,1
5,"I love mine! Great price, lens replacement is super easy and quick!",1
5,This band looks great and works perfectly with my Apple Watch Series 6. It is a quslity product at a great price!,1
5,"He was out and about and wearing the skinny Black Moto jeans 👖 when she, a complete stranger, told him they gave him a wicked fine ....5",1
5,This was absolutely adorable for the baptizing.,1
5,Great fit.,1
1,"Disappointed in the color, in the image it shows them as a very dark, with vibrant colors. This is incredibly misleading. Color isn't close. It's a light colored earring with some shine to it when you turn them, or the light hits it. Not at all what's pictured.",0
1,"They have a weird fit to them, they sit really far from your face. Optics are ok.",0
1,not made for driving,0
1,As soon as opened plastic covering one strand came apart wore with 2 strands same day fell apart at work pieces everywhere terribly made,0
3,fabric is see through,0
1,Do not spend your money on this piece of garbage. It is nothing like the photo. It is way to small and more child size than for an adult woman. the photo on the front is poor quality.,0
3,"I like this but sizing seems inconsistent -- regular size (L) was too big, but the medium received appeared was wrinkled and not properly folded in the plastic bag..It appeared to have been worn (sleeves turned up) and washed and had shrunk (?).",0
5,"Absolutely beautiful earrings!  I wish they came in all stone colors, including mystic topaz and amethyst.",1
3,Necklace got a bit rusty after continuous use,0
4,This brooch is a lovely brooch for a bridal bouquet. Multi color stones and rhinestones to add some bling.,1
5,Product as advertised would but again,1
1,Bought large for grandson who is over 6 feet. In this country he wears a 42 slim. This was like for a 9 year old.  Not happy with the quality either  but i guess thats what i get for going to cheap.  Need th o see if i xan return. Don't know how that will work out.,0
5,Nice cold night dress,1
5,Good basic Silicone Watch Strap. At a fair price. nicely packaged with extra pins and pin bar.,1
4,"These would likely have 5 stars, but they haven't a clue about sizing.  I usually wear a 9.5 (US), sometimes a 9 in shoes that I don't intend to wear socks in.  That's how these seem to fit, maybe a little smaller.  Sizing seems to be entirely determined by the manufacturer anyway,  (I wear a 10.5 (US) in one top brand.).<br />Getting past the sizing, they feel great.  Little more than basic flat, zero drop, soles which seem to help my knees, with simple, good looking uppers.  The round toes leave plenty of &#34;wiggle room&#34;.  Haven't had them long enough to know about durability, but if they can be screwed up before their time, it'll happen to me.",1
5,I wanted to be able to adjust the fit of my Apple Watch and I love that this helps me do that so well. And it looks so good.,1
5,loved the skirt.... will order in different color soon.,1
1,This necklace's rhinestones kept falling apart. Crappiest made necklace ever,0
3,VERY PRETTY,0
5,Stunning!  Different back clip.,1
2,"I bought this for my husband, who is in a nursing home. It is a tad small, fits too snugly on his wrist.  At 6 ft. tall he has an athletic build but his wrist is not unusually large and he is not overweight. This would be better suited to a woman of  medium to small size. Would be better still if it were adjustable.",0
1,Good Grief!  The mask is so tight that it's about ready to pull my ears off!  The beard is staight across below the nose. not curved like the picture.,0
1,These were already tarnished once I got them?,0
5,The dress was exactly as expected.,1
5,Small pieces but cute,1
5,Great Color. Perfect fit. I’m a size 4/6 34dd…. No bra need. This dress is so comfortable. Can’t wait to wear this for photos. Color is more is more of a marigold in the yellow family.,1
2,"The top lacy part is cute but the bottom is of a See-through material that’s cut too boxy, which is unflattering.  There is no chance it flares/hangs heavy like the picture.  The picture makes it look more like an A-cut but it’s closer to a pillowcase.  Overall it’s not “horrible” but not cute enough to even hide with a denim jacket.  I’m returning it.",0
5,Macy’s online showed these shoes last year but didn’t have them to purchase.  Amazon did! I love ann Klein style of shoes & they are always so very comfortable.,1
5,"I ordered this shirt in L, though I wear a M, because I was expecting it to be too small like most clothing off Amazon; It is actually true to size, so its a bit large. Let me tell you, this is my new favorite shirt. I bought it to work out in because it was cheep and cute and I am debating on buying another because it is just amazing. The material is really soft and comfortable, it fits really nicely and its funny. I recommend this shirt to any and everyone!",1
1,This one was a mess ripped faded and just not a good brand. Have previously gotten this bag in other colors and this bag did not sit well with me . After a few wears this bag did not work well. Don’t waste your money hate it with a capital H.,0
1,"terrible quality,<br />doesnt fit right",0
3,"Love the jewerly. It's gorgeous, but the backs on the earrings dont hold well enough. Lost an earring before I even started my bday party at a lounge. Should switch the type of backs u use.",0
3,"Everyday watch, it's okay.",0
3,They feel light and cheap so only using as backup for when a regular pair can't be found.,0
1,Was told it was delivered and it wasn’t 🤷‍♂️,0
3,"Love this light airy dress, it runs a little small so be sure to order up to your next size. Comes up well above your knees as well!",0
1,"The listing & description says “clickers”, as if multiple. It’s only one. Deceptive.",0
5,My husband totally loves this mask!!!,1
1,"I ordered a 2 X and it was more like a medium. I read the reviews so I bought sizes up, but that did not work. I was not very happy with this purchase, but for the price I just did not bother with the hassle of returning it.",0
1,So disappointed. The fit is at least 3 sizes too small. Cheap material.,0
5,"These fit my size 7.5 sooo well, and they are super soft - my wife and I fight over them in the morning!",1
4,I bought big so they go over my suit for work. I havent been down in them so i dont know how they hold up. but they keep me very warm in the morning rides across the bridge and they feel great. pads are sturdy the build is sturdy and it connects to my jacket also bought on amazon. love the reinforced zipper/velcro on pockets and crotch. zip out liner is awesome feature even though i leave it in.<br /><br />Dont let the name brand guys milk you for money. this stuff is as good as anything out there. only affordable.,1
4,Love the gown!!!!!,1
3,"not a big as pictured. not for use for school books. a day hike, carry on or one night over stay it will be perfect.",0
5,"I love the snap it was perfect for memorial Day, and I'm sure for all my other veteran holidays. Thank you",1
5,Really soft and comfortable with nice pockets. What more could you want? lol,1
1,"Hat is flat and wrinkled, looks iron on symbol... waiting so ling for a disappointment",0
3,Fits snug and sexy. Wore it to my sisters wedding.  Would have wanted to wear it longer but the zipper broke the first time. The zipper is hard to pull up and down and in the effort to get our it broke.  Getting a tailor to fix it will cost more than the dress. But cheap enough that I did not mind too much.,0
5,The sleeves were exactly what my daughter wanted. Very stylish.,1
5,Loved traveling with them.  Kept me organized,1
4,Es practico,1
2,"Thought it would be more  shinier,dull looking",0
2,"The first word that comes to mind is adorable!  I needed a comfy dress to slip on after my shower and this is perfect. The fabric is soft and ultra supple feeling on my skin. There is a nice size pocket on each side that fashionably blends in with the floral pattern. I am not in the habit of running outside in my lounging apparel,however I would have no problem moseying out to my mailbox clad in this cute little shift. I love it, and highly recommend purchasing this adorable frock.<br /><br />Loved it so much I purchased another dress in a different color.  Unfortunately the black and white dress had a huge tear on the side. It's in a precarious spot, which makes it impossible to mend!  So disappointed!  I will retract my positive reviews to others who planned on purchasing this item as well.",0
3,Small,0
3,I am a large and this fit more like a medium. The material doesn’t do any favors either as it’s very clingy so every bump in my torso was accentuated. I returned it.,0
5,Love the color a crimson red size L (12/14) fit.  like the fact you can zip and unzip to you liking.,1
5,This makes a great carry-on bag for short trips.,1
1,Sweatshirt (hoodie) was too small. Very unhappy.,0
2,Doesn't stay in place. Doesn't cover the length of ear as pictured. Very unhappy with this but would cost more to send back.,0
1,Made of cheap material. I bought this for our Bahamas trip and I was so disappointed with it. It doesn't even look like the one in the picture.  I ended up not wearing it.,0
4,"Very nice, but be aware the gems are only in one area, causing the beads to hang down under your wrist so you cant see the nice beads. It has rubber retainer bands that I slide over so the beads spead over the entire bracelet. It is extremely well made with a safety chain. I do really like it.",1
5,Cute top. Doesn’t stay in place. For the price it was nice.,1
5,Absolutely beautiful!  Just what I was looking for.,1
4,The fit is pretty form fitting and does a good amount of cleavage . I'm 5'5 it was a bit short for me. Nice dress maybe for someone really thin and short.,1
5,I love these.  Very effective,1
5,"[[ASIN:B01EQUWPHA Jstyle Jewelry 8MM Titanium Rings for Men Wedding Engagement Rings Promise Size 10]]<br /><br />I was looking for the perfect engagement band for my soon to be husband. He bought me a beautiful diamond engagement band, so I wanted to get him something beautiful too. I will say in the case of this ring it does run a little on the large side and although he usually wears a size 10 this ring was loose on his finger.  Having said that, it is a beautifully crafted ring and well made.  Since it is made in a super strong titanium it is made to last a lifetime.  If you check local jewelers or jewelry chain stores you will find that the prices for a band like this are astronomical.  This ring is gorgeous and looks like expensive white gold at a fraction of the cost.  The band is crafted in a comfort fit style and is comfortable on the hand.  It has 9 individual princess cut stones (square) that emit just the right amount of sparkle and shine on the hand.  This is a gorgeous ring and at a cost of only 12.99 including shipping you can't go wrong.  It's a good value made of tarnish free and strong Titanum and will be lovely for an engagement ring or wedding band.",1
3,"My son likes the designs. If he uses the ear holes, the mask covers his eyes.",0
3,Not for big hips,0
5,"Very nice, love the material, wear a camisole underneath",1
1,The cable pulls out if the crimped connector and fails.,0
5,I love them!! can't wait to wear them,1
3,Pretty dress but didnt fit me. Gave it to my younger sister,0
2,"I really wanted to like this, but I just couldn't win. At first I ordered a small because I'm a 32. It fit around the band but the bra part was so small it barely covered a thing (I'm a c cup). I returned it and ordered the medium/large and it still fit around the band at the tightest setting but it seemed like the bra part was the same size as the small...I barely fit in it! Such a bummer! The shipping is as very fast though",0
2,This probably for men only. Im have a very small head and my hair is short and this wouldn’t properly sit on my head. Too small. Otherwise quality was okay and very lightweight,0
3,"The design is nice, but the material is very thin. It will work if you're in a pinch and need something quick, but be prepared to wear shapewear underneath. It fits just like it is shown on the models.",0
2,its too small like really small and it doesnt look all that great.,0
1,Disappointed it was too small,0

1,I plan to return all 4,0
1,"Got an XS for my 13 yr old daughter. We were both very surprised when it came in. It was HUGE. Too big for her, too big for me, and even too big for her grandmother. Sizing is waaaaaaaay off.",0
3,"I would give 5 stars for the top, and 2 stars for the bottoms.  The top fits great, it's roomy enough with sleeves long enough (I have long arms) and it's really cute too.  I can wear it with other bottoms or just as it is. The bottoms are not so good.  They really should have designed them without the cut-up sides which shows all your cellulite.  It would have been perfect if the shorts were actual swim shorts and would have looked so good with the top.  And there's no gusset in the bottoms which makes them even more uncomfortable.",0
5,Super cute,1
4,This is cute and casual summer top. I don’t love the material but I don’t hate it either. My fault for not noticing it is mostly polyester.<br /><br />Fits a bit snug for my liking but still fits - order a size up maybe?<br /><br />Cute patterns here.,1
1,The large is big on me its cute but the material was like nylon fit like a onezie lol make sure u got plenty of butt n boops lol,0
1,"Ordered 3 different sizes to get a good fit as they were so big, then the bow fell off within ONE DAY of my daughter wearing them. It's just glued on, it should be stitched",0
5,Love it!,1
2,"I'm 6'0"" and they are quite a bit short.",0
5,Perfect shirt. Exactly what I expected. Great quality cotton,1
5,"Nice color, exactly like the picture showed. Also, it came with a box which is great for storage.",1
4,"I read the item description and knew the width, but it would have been an even better belt if it were thicker. Worked great with a plain black dress and matching turquoise heels",1
5,So cute. Fit well,1
4,"I am a person that reads every single review before I purchase, and I have to say this dress was true to the reviews. The material is a little weird- almost like a house dress from the 70's(think Mrs. Roper), it looks like it should flow, but its a little stiff. The neckline really plunges, true to other reviewer's pics, but I just sewed it up a few stitches and it hid my strapless bra just fine. I ordered it in cream, but its more like white. Despite this odd review, I really like this dress and can't wait to wear it.",1
5,"Sturdy, stylish, exactly as described, and packaged nicely. Work people liked the slightly edgy but still professional look. My style maven teenage daughter is already trying to get me to give it to her...",1
3,Not terrible; get what you pay for.,0
5,"Very very comfortable and durable, this is a replacement for one pair I bought in south America 4 years ago, so I searched for the same brand. They look great and hopefully they will last as long as the first pair. Worth the money. I highly recommend them.",1
5,Really cute!  Loved it,1
5,This black sweater’s winning feature is the way its sleeves are shaped.   Each sleeve has two elastic bands which break up the sleeves into three bumps making this sweater looking modern and original.  Other than that this sweater is very simple and its simplicity has an elegant look.  Puffed sleeves are adding a bit of modern feel to it.  I like this sweater for its not so obviously simple look.  Very unusual and surprising design.    <br />This sweater is great to wear on many occasions.,1
5,"I bought these earrings for an NPC bikini competition and I am very pleased with them they are exactly what I wanted for an amazing price.  These earrings will look great on stage but I don't know if I would wear them everyday out and about, maybe for a fancy event. Up close the big gem in the middle looks a little fake or cheesy but if you have long hair or people won't be looking at them closely they look very nice.",1
3,The product was thinner than I expected.,0
5,Comfy and cute.,1
5,Dry nice and works.,1
1,Well I didn't receive the blue camo bag that I ordered.  Sent the plain green.  I knew when I ordered it was the last one.  So I kept the ugly plain green.  Other then that I like the bag.  Holds everything no problems with weight so far. Heavy duty zippers.  Seams look like they will hold up.<br />Only improvement I'd do to this bag is put some straps inside the bag to hold poles from sliding around.,0
5,Liked a lot! No complaints,1
5,Love this brand and the soft fit. Highly recommend.,1
3,"I originally ordered a medium and it was a bit big, so I ordered a small. The small is even larger than the medium. So frustrating as it is a nice basic dress.",0
4,Great patterns,1
4,its very nice and sparkly,1
5,I ordered a medium because I am 5’9 145 lbs it was the perfect length even with heels and great quality I wore to a Halloween party and I received so many compliments I bought three one for each of my friends in a different color and everyone agreed this cape was amazing,1
2,Is a little short and I thought it was cute but I wore it ONCE washed it ONCE and it got holes in it!! Pretty cheap.,0
5,Didn't come with a chain but beautiful pendant,1
1,Very thin and the seams were coming apart and I havent even wore them yet. I wouldn't purchase again but theyll make due to sleep in,0
5,"This outfit is so cute. Material is nice as well, recommend 100 %",1
5,"Grandsons love these for baseball. Fit well,don’t move around. Light weight.",1
5,I love my new bracelets,1
4,"If your skinniest part is exactly in the middle of your torso, as mine is, then this will be flattering.  I'm thin but have a large ribcage, so the thinnest part of my waist is in a different place than most women (which I think is usually right below the bust).  For me, this works out well.<br /><br />And PS, one side has the stipes matching up perfectly, the left side not so much.  I noticed that was the case in the model picture, so I wasn't expecting perfection.  It's soft, stretchy, and has pockets that don't seem to add bulk, and it seems it would be perfect to throw on over a swimsuit for some modesty if running from the pool or beach right to a restaurant or shopping.<br /><br />I got the red striped version in Medium, which seems to fit me well (I'm 5'7"", 140#) with long legs and shorter torso, it hits me just below the knee at the hem.  Not the most beautiful dress I own, but nice for those ""not trying too hard but want to look decent"" kind of days.",1
2,Very flimsy and doesn't confirm to your head very well. Just a very cheaply made item.,0
5,"Glasses are a good quality, not cheap at all. Love them, we buy them again.",1
2,I disliked the fact that the metal band tarnished in one day of wearing the ring.,0
1,The material and the construction of this dress is cheap. Would not recommend.,0
5,solid product,1
4,"These shoes look great!  They are, however, about 1/2 a size smaller than you would expect.  The material and the sole do not give in so you gotta size up!",1
4,Very satisfied. Comfy and flattering.,1
1,"first day of my gym , leggings ripped. such a shame.  couldnt finish my work out . some guy at gym told me that it ripped, it is terrible. bad product dont buy.!",0
3,"Very warm, but the snaps pop open when you sit down, and it's a little too bulky.",0
3,THE FABRIC WAS THIN AND THE XL WAS NOT REALLY XL,0
2,"I like all of the elements of the package, but the little glasses are way too small for my face. They are more child size. Also, one of the nose pads on the glasses came off as I was taking it out of the package. Other than the glasses, all of the other parts are as expected.",0
5,"Love this shirt, right fit long enough. Wore this shirt during the holidays and it was admired by other people. I thought it was going to be bad it was not and who ever get this shirt would also love it and the price was right. Keep up the good work",1
1,I returned this item as soon as I got it you’re completely on the small side.,0
5,Perfect,1
3,I wear a size 12 and it is almost too small. It will work with a cami but not a long sleeve shirt.,0
5, ,1
5,Wore it for my daughters graduation in June and once another time. It dressed up my simple black dress. Loved it.,1
1,"Very thin material. I always wear XL, and that is what this is marked, however it is obviously too small for me, so the size is mismarked. Unfortunately I didn't try it on until several months after I purchased it, so I'm stuck with it.",0
5,"My only quibble is that these could stand to be a little longer. My wrist is about average and I find the elastic to be a bit tight. I imagine that for a person with larger wrists, this would be quite uncomfortable. Still, the appearance and quality are fantastic.",1
2,Underwears are made nicely and appear to have a smooth construction but but I put them on and lean forward the completely rolled down. I ended up just donating them because it would be very uncomfortable to have to keep pulling them up a million times a day.,0
3,Great quality but a little bit large'_',0
4,"These are like a cross between a workout legging and a jogger. They are super comfy and would be nice to lounge around in, workout in, or just go for a walk or a hike. I actually like that they are a little baggy in the legs.",1
2,The gauge size was right but the part that shows was way to big.,0
5,I looked up a lot of masks and read many reviews before finding these. I'm so glad I did because these masks are the real deal! They are well-made and fit my 9 year old and 13 year old. They already have their covid shots but this definitely makes me feel better sending them to school or going out to stores during this surge.,1
5,"Super happy with it, came very wrapped up as to not break in transit!",1
1,The print zeroed in on my left breast and looked like a bulls eye. So I returned it.,0
2,You get what you pay for.,0
5,Dress fit perfect and was so cute!,1
5,I absolutely love this sleeper. It’s so comfortable and extremely soft material! I wish they had more colors,1
4,Received exactly as shown in description. Received in timely manner. Thank you.,1
5,"Product arrived promptly. It looks as it is listed, and fits me just fine.",1
5,Such a beautiful treat for myself.  The crystals shimmer while the setting shows them off so elegantly.  Glad I got this bracelet. Treasure it.,1
5,"Absolutely loved this piercing! Small, delicate. Easy to put on and to remove.",1
1,Did not take a photo. This dress was very wrinkle. Unwearable in its condition. I don’t know if one need to put this dress in the dryer or iron it to make it wearable. It was my intention to take a photo of this dress for the review. Horrible to me.,0
5,Good quality,1
5,"These are so fabulous I'm planning to buy them in every color. They're comfy, perfectly sized and opaque, which is more than I can say for Lululemon at four times the price. No reason to spend more than this. Highly recommended.",1
3,Great color but stretches out pretty quickly.,0
2,the fabric is weird material and it is too small.,0
5,Since all the shops are closed now I bought these for my old work shoes that needed to be resoled to see what I could do on my own. I also purchased the Barge contact cement well worth the cost as that really worked well and I was able to get these half soles on really good. There was no need to trim the heels they fit spot on as is and I had very little to trip off the half sole and it was easy with a new razor. TIme will tell how they last but they did give new life to my old soles and I think I will be purchasing again.,1
1,very cheap fabric and construction,0
4,It is warm for cold and windy New York weather. I like that is detachable the fur ball!,1
5,love them great for multi holes nice size can wear several together or mix with other styles would recommend them,1
3,"I bought this to possibly give as a gift, but I didnt think the quality was(is) that great. Its more like for a teenager. I did not give it to the intended adult recipient. Its not bad though.",0
3,Lindo pero la mañita seronpe facil mente con solo medirselo pero muy lindo,0
2,Button pull off when she tried it on,0
5,Thank You 😊,1
1,The size medium is more like an extra-extra small. They look like children leggings. The color is also way more pink than purple. Overall these are not flattering in any way.,0
2,"In the picture, it looks nice and classy. In reality, it looks like it came from the thrift store. It is smaller than the medium here. This would be extra small here. But I did not know this is not made in the US.",0
4,Great dress ! It is flowy and didn't go past my knees. True to color. Looks great with tights !,1
5,Love it. Been wearing it everyday. It's on my hand now after a few weeks and it's nice.<br />Update: I still wear this ring everyday. It is comfortable and it goes everywhere with me. It wasn't too expensive and it really is Sterling silver. I'm allergic to nickel so I know it's the real deal.,1
5,Love it!,1
3,"I don't feel like the size listed for these is accurate. I wear a 7 1/2 womens shoe size and ordered the 5-8 shoe size socks. They are very tight, I wish I had gotten the next size up. Otherwise these seem good, I don't think they will be prone to slipping down or fall off.",0
5,Love these style of sunglasses. Gives me the classic 80's vibe with these.,1
5,"the product was as described, easy to install and it looks of good quality. I am very satisfied with the purchase.",1
2,Not what I expected,0
1,I thought that was a normal size watch but it's too small I mean the price is good for what you get...thanks,0
1,The cover I received is a fake... printed on both sides and WAY too dark.,0
4,"Very tight fit on hips, but that was expected. Waist a little big, but manageable, especially with a shirt and corset. My measurements are 27” waist and 40” hips and I got an 8.",1
1,"Gloves are very cute, I love the style.  The gloves are not red, they were maroon.",0
5,Love these shorts. I bough two pairs!!  So comfortable!!,1
3,My legs are still pretty achy after work,0
1,This only came with one choker not twelve!,0
3,Not sure if I like it it's cute but fits kind of funny can't really oh my finger on what's wrong,0
5,"It is hard to find a coin purse that is made for a man. Years ago My father introduced me to the squeeze coin purse. Now that to me is the ultimate coin purse for a man. You squeeze its round shape, and it opens up to reveal all your coins. No need to empty all the coins in your hand yo get the right coins. Unfortunately the makers of those coin purses have decided to use a very soft glove leather. That is fine and well for gloves, but is far too soft for that type of coin purse. As a result, that type of coin purse will not even hold its own shape much less hold any coins. That has required a search to find a new style of coin purse. I settled on this style as all the coins can be viewed while the purse is open. The quality is top notch. I hope to get many years of use. It is the perfect size to go in your pocket, and expands to accommodate all your coins. This is a winner for me.<br />I have had this coin purse for a few months and it is holding up well. I hope to buy another when it becomes available again.",1
1,"This mask is way too small. Made for a child's face, does not give full coverage at all. They try very hard to cover up the fact they're made in China but it's obvious when you receive them. Cheap elastics and stitching as well. Will probably fall apart after washing a few times",0
3,"The sizing is off, It says Large 14-16 years old, I say if they are very short!!!! disappointing!",0
5,I bought this and the matching earrings. I love them!,1
1,Don't buy this dress unless your SMALL,0
5,The shirt is awesome,1
5,This dress is gorgeous! Great quality for the price and the color is so pretty!,1
5,They look adorable and block some sunlight wish they were darker but they look cute.,1
1,The color in not the color of a face. Too red in color. I ordered another from the same supplier  that looked more flesh color and that was red too. Did not match the description one the add. What a waste of $28 dollars. Very unhappy!!,0
5,It was really cozy and soft,1
1,"Opened the box and promptly threw it away...didn't even try it on it was terribly made, crooked, seems exposed and just overall BAD",0
5,Love it and wear it every day. Bought a second piece.,1
4,"The cups and lower band fit well and are comfortable, but the shoulder straps and upper back fit a bit too snug to be completely comfortable. Otherwise, the bras are made very well and are of very good quality.",1
3,"Face plate and hand are not the same color, band is more rose gold.  It’s okay for everyday wear.",0
3,No way is this 100% cotton. Every time I buy something from China that says cotton it’s polyester crap. Just be honest and stop lying. Thanks.,0
4,"This piece is great. Feels very durable and is heavy. My only concerns, although minor, are that the colors on the rope are reversed and the stone is rather dull.",1
1,"The material is really thin, light and not of great quality. It’s definitely not worth the $18 it’s priced at. The amazon best seller by Champion costs a lot less and is of great quality compared to this. Will definitely not recommend.",0
2,Bad fit & finish!,0
4,"A little flimsy, but besides that good shades",1
5,Cut to small ! Size up for a better fit ! I guess???????,1
2,This material collects dryer lint like crazy and it balls up.,0
3,It's okay. It's small and has super sharp edges. Need to put some kind of felt or velvet lining.,0
5,"I bought this for a vacation as I didn't want to wear a full cardigan/kimono. I hate my arms and have a hard time finding things that make them look decent. This top hid my arms, but allowed me to wear a tank top. It's sheer so it adds a touch of elegance to it, and the cropped style is flattering as it stops at the waistline.<br />Would definitely recommend, and possibly buy in another color!",1
5,Love it,1
1,The product states it comes in assorted colors. If you consider 1/2 of them being the same color as assorted then we have different definitions. Would not recommend ordering unless you don’t mind getting 6 of the same color.,0
5,Everything I expected and more,1
3,"Within a few uses of hanging this in a bathroom when traveling, the lining started to split.  It still works, but just not great quality.  Nice that it has so many little zippers to store various things.",0
2,"I was super excited to purchase this ring for I am a huge Harry Potter fan. When I received my Gryffindor ring, the exterior design was very poor. My Gryffindor flag instead of having stars looks like a pizza and the lion is just sad looking. The quality of the ring as far as durability goes is great.",0
5,Best dress for a wedding. The dress is comfy and it fits my body type perfectly. If you are anything like me chunky with a tummy  and a booty I would recommend. Material is  durable and it does not show your undergarment lines. I was the star of the show,1
5,Used these to make diy sundays for my bridesmaids as a gift they could use on my wedding cruise. Great quality and shape.,1
1,"The shoes looked great, but did not last past a few hours after getting wet. The bottom came off and were completely worthless. Do not recommend.",0
4,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,1
5,Great belt! Nice quality...great packaging!,1
5,Great value!,1
4,"I love the look, feel, and durability of this band / case. I would like everyone to know after install you will NOT be able to turn the crown. If you have a series 4 you can still get a EKG reading because it uses the surface. If it was not for the crown  it being able to be turned it would be perfect.",1
3,"I'd have given it an extra star but it came with a huge hole in the seam of the arm. Luckily it can be fixed so I won't need to return it, but I'd expect better quality for the cost.",0
1,"I tried these on and were not impressed. The Elastic on the waste is pencil thin. Yes, they would have been comfortable but too much like pajamas the way they fell on my legs. I return them ASAP. Thank goodness it was easy return.",0
3,Cute shirt but the color was nothing like the picture. I ordered the mint green and instead got an aqua blue color,0
5,Absolutely love this product. I bought it for my bridesmaids. It's beautiful.,1
1,Hat was way to big. I wear a size 53 hat. Took a size S & was still very big on me.,0
5,Nothing,1
4,They fit as expected and seem to wash well. One other reviewer commented that his socks shrank in the first wash and he subsequently had to give them to his child. Mine have gone through two wash cycles so far and still fit my size 9 feet.,1
1,Very cheap made and cheap looking gum ball machine quilty .,0
5,Perfect for my flapper costume for Halloween. Pretty sturdy for costume jewelry.,1
1,Received this item and it was damaged with a large crack in the glass.,0
4,"This 18K White Gold Plated Simulated Diamond Half Eternity Ring comes nicely packaged in a gift box and little velvety pouch.<br /><br />My ring did have a sticky section on the bottom of the band, as if there was a sticker that had been removed. The residue cleaned off, I just thought it was strange.<br /><br />The fit is true to size.<br /><br />I thought the red stones for the White Gold - Red color option were a bit lighter than pictured. But the ring does look nice in person; it’s not too blingy and doesn’t catch the light a lot, so it doesn’t scream fake.",1
5,pretty,1
1,"the color was way off. and the material is very cheap, the shoulders kept rolling down all evening and the underpiece also. i would not urchase from this seller again. it was a disapointment",0
5,"My daughters loved this watch! it was good quality for the price! this is something I could not find in any stores ANYWHERE!  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND, AND PURCHASE AGAIN!",1
4,Fits kinda loose,1
3,"The hat itself is fairly cute. The velvet bow on the back adds a bit of style and visual interest. The interior of the hat has a velcro strap that can help adjust the hat's circumference to allow for a better fit. However, the chinstrap was not actually attached to the hat. It was a separate cord with an adjustment toggle, so I'm assuming you loop it over the top of the hat and then secure it under your chin...only downside is that it looks a bit ridiculous and it's not particularly effective. We live in a very windy area, so the extra benefit of a chin strap to keep it secure is essential.<br /><br />The hat itself is flexible and packable. It is a bit floppy which makes it easy to fold when needed. The brim offers a bit of additional sun protection for both the face and neck without having an overly large, wide brim.",0
3,The watch is all silver and does not have any rose tone like the picture looks like,0
2,"I wanted to keep these boots--the style is perfect--but the quality just wasn't near the $120 price tag.<br /><br />The box these boots come in has graphics matching the boot, which is a nice touch. Upon inspecting the boots, I was relieved the material does seem like leather, unlike the claims of another product reviewer here saying they were, ""man made material."" If the leather is some type of synthetic leather, it's indistinguishable from the real thing--at least in looks, if not durability.<br /><br />The design on the front of the ankle is not printed on, but engraved into the leather, which is a bonus. However, the leather under the engraving looks slightly porous, so that might be what the other reviewer is referencing.<br /><br />The studs throughout the boot looks sturdy enough. If even one fell out, though, it would significantly detect from the overall look.<br /><br />The buckle is purely aesthetic, non functional, although it's the only element of these boots that looks better in person--everything else looks and feels like a lesser version of the great pictures here on Amazon.<br /><br />The zipper is a little small and frail feeling, and the left boot zipper kept getting caught. I had to wiggle it a lot to get it to become unstuck.. I imagine this issue would become worse.<br /><br />The size feels true lengthwise, but I usually wear wide, so these felt slightly narrow.<br /><br />The sole has a complete lack of traction on rough tile, although it was acceptable on hardwood floor, oddly enough. It was difficult walking to get a feel for the fit and comfort as these boots kept sliding around like sneakers on an ice rink. I'm not sure if this would improve as the sole gets scuffed, but winter is coming, so I wasn't  too thrilled about finding out. The smooth, hard texture suggests the slip problem would continue.<br /><br />The straps that run in front of the ankle, attached to the buckle, were the deal-breaker. The left boot was perfect--snug, not tight, and served it's aesthetic purpose. The right boot strap, however, was sewed in a quarter inch too long, so the strap sags and is loose. If you tighten the strap by moving the buckle one hole, the strap becomes too tight, not to mention asymmetrical.<br /><br />The style of this boot is fantastic. I would gladly pay more for a higher quality product, but with the craftsmanship of these boots varying so much between the pair, I just couldn't justify keeping them, regardless of how much I love the style (minus the sagging strap). Quality control does not existent for these boots--just a quick glance would tell you the two don't match. Due to this, I didn't have confidence the durability would last more than a couple weeks before it noticeably fell apart. This might be acceptable at $20-$30 (if it weren't for that sagging strap!) but the quality is not $140.<br /><br />In the end, I returned these boots. Be careful, because you might get mine!<br /><br />Summary: I wanted to keep these boots--the style is perfect--but the quality just wasn't near the $120 price tag.",0
1,THIS PRODUCT WAS A KNOCK-OFF! THE PATTERN IS NOT THE SAME AT ALL!!,0
5,"I've tried several summer tops for riding and this is by far the best for riding in the Vegas heat.  The white and blue keeps the sun of your skin and the wind flows through freely.  And all Without sacrificing safety.  I'm 188 lbs and 5' 8"".  Large fits perfectly.",1
3,Más pequeño de lo que parece es como para una adolescente o muy joven,0
1,Completely see through :(,0
5,Awesome love it,1
5,"I love this top so much. I wear flare jeans with these & whoa, it's 😍😍😍.",1
5,Beautiful piece of jewelry! They don’t itch or turn your ear green! They do “hold tight” to your ear. I had to take them out after several hours. I’ll still wear them though. I’d rather them be tight than lose.,1
1,I was very dissappointed by this item.  It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened.  It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out.  The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap.  The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk.,0
2,Three of the 5 sets showed up ok. One set showed up broken and the other set was not even a close match to each other. I was pretty disappointed after opening the package.,0
4,"The sweater is nice and thick. It seems very well made, except the fact that the tag seems to have been sewn on the incorrect side. It was quickly remedied with a seam ripper.",1
5,Love it well made fits perfect,1
4,"I really like the style of this bracelet and enamel bead hides the clasp. It's a little hard to open, but wouldn't want it to get loose when wearing",1
5,"These are nice gloves. I have MS and use hand controls to drive. They are perfect for that and they prevent the callous that you get when you have to drive with your hands. I don't think I would like driving as much without them. I followed other reviews and ordered a large, when I usually wear medium gloves. The thumbs ran longer than I expected, but if your nails are long, they will fit fine. I know this because I cut my long nails down just recently and they fit better in other medium sized gloves, when they were longer. For ten dollars, you can't beat it and the leather is pretty good quality, too.",1
3,shrunk after 1 wash,0
4,Great fit but batteries not included for the mask to light up. Reasonably priced and comfortable. Ok to wear around all day at con without headache.,1
2,"Not really for large headed people,it's standard size and doesn't reduce sun rays very well",0
5,Soft and flattering. The burgundy color is rich. Glad I selected it.,1
1,It looks nice when the model wears it. Its made of poor materials looks very cheap when i wear it didnt bother returning bc its from china.,0
3,This shirt runs small. The struggle was real getting it on.,0
1,"Super cute and fit well, the one time she got to wear them. I thought maybe it was one color, but it was every single one. Bummer. Waste of money and shipping.",0
3,It is a beautiful dress but small in the hip area.,0
3,"Super cute pattern but the neckline is completely different and almost straight across. The darts are horizontal, not vertical. The material is stretchy polyester which normally would be fine but not with this dress. I was hoping for a stiffer material. The dress itself has potential. Size up 1 size.",0
5,I ordered one size up im a xl in the United States so I bought a 2xl and it fits perfectly. It looks just like the picture I love it,1
5,thank u,1
5,Very adorable and versatile socks - abundant choices and great colors.  Thanks!,1
3,It’s nice but actually hurts more than getting a real one. Wasn’t very comfortable for me.,0
3,"Love the color, the flow, the style, the fabric, but the size is way off.  3xl is probably a size 18 at best. Had to give to my daughter, not worth the hassle of returning",0
1,A little small and issues with excess material where the tongue is sewn on causing them to dig/cut into the top of the foot. if it was not for the tongue issue/poor craftsmanship these would have got a 5-star review on style alone,0
3,"Was too large and heavy had to return. But the quality of the purse as a whole is great. If you don’t have back problems and don’t mind the weight this purse is beautiful. The crossover strap doesn’t have its own loops, it’s the same loops to clip to as the shoulder strap. Made it a bit awkward feeling.",0
1,When i open it for the first time i didnot see it properly but today when i opened it again i saw mold on bag,0
3,"Feels like cheap thick poly crepe material…. But they fit. The crotch is a bit long. I wanted to return but missed the window, so I will wear them… eventually… maybe.",0
2,too small,0
5,Everyone compliments these when I wear them. So cute!,1
3,Somewhat small in the &#34;ball&#34; area. My husband has a big one down there so... 😉 overall looks nice if you can cover the balls lol.,0
5,Nice necklace. Heavy enough but still small enough for girls too!,1
1,"I did not like this shirt.  Has a little on the small side & the colors were off, not like picture. Was soft but not for me.",0
2,"Quality is what I expected for earrings of this price, but the kicker is the difference in the photoshopped product picture here and that of what you recieve. The backs of this earring are a fake gold CLIP that hangs down WELL past the earring itself (see photos). They look terrible from the front, as you can see these severely fake gold looking things sticking out. And then the front earring is rather heavy (to be expected with a button earring) but this 'fancy' clip is supposed to hold it close to your ear, and are NOT tight enough at their hinges, and the earring faces drop slightly downward and away from front of ear. These are the earrings you'd find at the front of an old souvenir shop in Chinatown for $2.99, or at your local DollarTree store. Although I like the blue rosettes, the rhinstones are not clear as pictured, but champagne colored. I would not recommend.",0
5,Nice necklace and delivery faster than expected!,1
4,I bought this as a gift it was well made and she absolutely loved it because she is an elephant lover!,1
5,"Love! Love! Love! Fits perfect I'm 5'1"" and weigh 180lbs and it fits perfect. Very lightweight and comfortable. Stylish to be dressed up or down. Good quality and very reasonably priced. Will purchase in another color.",1
3,i would have kept this but there is no underwire to support the cups and keep it in place so if you bend over you'll most likely spill out or flash someone. the look of the suit is very flattering overall but i decided to return it for the zero support at the bust.,0
5,My husband bought this bag for my birthday.  I picked it out online and with limited reviews and he purchase it.  Love it!,1
5,Much nicer looking than the ugly original color.,1
4,"These make great back up goggles. They don’t protect against fog completely, but they are good for about half a day of boarding if you don’t take them off or rest them on your hat (where they pick up moisture). I keep them in my backpack when snowboarding or snowmachining and use them if my Smiths get wet.",1
5,Un poco grande. Muy buena calidad y diseño,1
5,Super cute! I ordered one size larger and it fits,1
1,Way too big,0
5,Love the style and color. Arrived on time. Fits nicely.,1
3,Buen Producto,0
5,It is very comfortable,1
1,They only lasted a month or 2,0
5,"Great sunglasses for my 3 and 5 year old! I was debating purchasing Ray-Bans for them as I was so tired of all of the sunglasses I buy for them getting broken within days (Gap, Old Navy, Target, etc.). I'm so glad I didn't pay the price for Ray-Bans, as these are affordable, look great, and also are holding up really well! They are sturdy, yet flexible, and easy to clean the lenses.",1
5,Would be better if they had silicone nose pads.,1
3,"It is worth the price for a fold up backpack, but after a month or so of use, the straps are starting to tear off.  I'm not carrying heavy weights, but I use it when I walk to the store.  I gave it a three because that is my honest opinion, it isn't bad, but I'm not thrilled with the backpack either.",0
4,My son says they are great,1
3,"I bought this hat specifically because I have long hair and it was supposed to have a hole in the back to pull a ponytail through, it does not.  It's fine otherwise, but if you want to pull your hair through then get a different hat",0
1,Kept sending me the wrong size. Not bad looking but definitely a bit wide and short.,0
1,It never worked.  Wouldn't run at all.,0
1,Too big returned,0
5,Stunning eyeglasses<br />Fix comfortable-lots of compliments received,1
3,"Not for adults. It’s very small and hot to put on. Claustrophobic folks will only use it once. It doesn’t curve up like the images suggest. I doubt it's durable. Not worth the phone call to request a refund.<br /><br />Let's hope it would be useful to some child in our extended family. Otherwise, it will be recycled.",0
5,Have had my first few pairs for more than 2 years. Wanted more and they never disappoint. Toughest sock around.,1
1,"Horrible product! It came faded and in poor quality! The beads are on a fishing wire type string, it is very loose! Do not buy anything from this company!, I bought two necklaces and both are horrible quality! It was shipped from overseas and not worth the cost to send it back!",0
5,These are knuckle rings so you are meant to wear them under the knuckle just like the picture they show. They look great no and I love them! Small size so only buy if you have skinny/normal fingers,1
5,"This dress is beautiful. I love the knitted, stretchy lace. It's heavy and comfortable. I would totally keep this dress, but the top part doesn't fit over my chest. I don't want to wear something underneath because my favorite thing is the neckline. The rest of the dress fit very nicely - true to size.<br />For reference, I got a large. I'm 170lbs, 38G.",1
5,It conformed perfectly to my face. Liked the quality and design.. very satisfied. I was a bit skeptical prior to ordering it but was very happy when I open the pkg. It looked great.,1
5,My son received this as a gift from Great Grandma. He tries to sleep in it every night.,1
1,I must receive the bands on 3rd of march but I still fidnt received any thing so I asked for refund,0
5,"They fit true to size (true to my other Rocket Dog boots), are comfortable, and more versatile than I thought they would be. Not all booties function well and look good with both skinny and bootleg pants for example, but these worked with a range of Jean/trouser leg types.<br />They also seemed to be made as expected. Had some flex, which helps with comfort, and there were no manufacturer defects.",1
3,Wrinkles very easily.,0
5,"I love the color, it is beautiful.  I purchased 2 more for my other 2 luggage pieces.  Worth the money, great value and very sturdy. 😍",1
2,"It runs very small, the material is thin and it is way too short to be called a tunic.  I normally wear a med and ordered a large (I have a 34 bust) it was tight across the chest and hips.",0
4,"What I like best about the YOIHUR FULL OF STARS GOLD RING is that it can be worn two ways, depending on your mood.  It is an attractive simple ring that can be stacked with other rings.  I personally think it looks best all by itself.<br /><br />When you turn the stars to the inside, it looks like a wide solid gold wedding band.  It looks expensive and understated.  Wearing it with the cubic zirconia chips showing, adds sparkle and visual interest.  I do think it looks more like costume jewelry with the sparkle side showing.  It does  look good both ways,  and some outfits look even better when you add a little sparkle.<br /><br />I got it in the widest width available and am really pleased with the overall size of the ring and the way it looks on my hand.<br /><br />I will wear this ring constantly, only replacing it if it becomes discolored.  At some point that is to be expected with gold filled and gold plated jewelry.  If it lasts a year, I will consider this to be a bargain.  If it starts losing its color or irritating my finger, I will update my review.",1
3,Still like it but no way can I wear it without tights.,0
3,"There is nothing special about this belt.  It is an overpriced basic leather belt of acceptable quality.  I got this belt as I found that every now and then I got a little sag with my concealed weapon at with my desired fit.  At first,  this belt seemed slightly better.  After a week, it is definitely worse than my heavy leather work belt.  The attached picture shows that the belt has itself developed a permanent sag, before even putting weight on it.  This is just a week of use.  My orriginal belt is a heavy duty work belt i picked up at the boot barn for about the same price.  It holds the weight up significantly better than this one which was supposedly built for the purpose.  When I hold out an 8"" loop on both and press them against the wall, my orriginal work belt feels significantly more ridgid.  In addition,  the work belt has closer holes, and looks better.  If you have a cheap belt from Wally world this one will be an improvement,  but a good genuine leather work belt will be better.",0
3,It doesn't look exactly like the pic as mentioned in a previous review.  Also the charcoal filter is useless because you cannot breathe through the filter.  Your breath just goes around the filter but its still a cool mask.,0
2,"First of all, mine were not as pictured, the two lotus parts were exactly the same, as in the bigger leaf was on the right on both which bothers me. But I let it go. The real thing that bothers me is that these come in 3 separate pieces. They are hard to get on and just feel weird. There's the bar, the lotus, and then the backing to keep them on. Not very comfortable and not what I expected.",0
5,My husband loves it and so do all the people. Great laughs that's what we need more of in these times. Thank you.,1
4,"Love how the XS feels and fits. I am 5'0&#34; and around 100lbs so it is often difficult to find pants that fit. $10 is a great price,but they do not look exactly as pictured, the colors are not as vibrant in person. Also, when stretched the colors appear more faded. Since I am short, the capris are longer on me (practically leggings).<br />I don't like how they increased the price from $9.99 to $12.99 overnight.",1
1,Too small for an XXL. Cheap material. Came with a hole in the armpit. Not satisfied but too lazy to return.,0
5,Looks great on m my wife super simple and secy,1
5,Protective arm golf sleeve- very comfortable and protects me from the sun since I go to the pool daily,1
1,Did not look good on me - I am 4'10&#34; and short-waisted.  This would look much better on someone taller and with a longer torso.,0
5,Nice,1
4,"The rings are beautiful, but i had to return them because they didn't meet the size specification as advertised. I normally wear a ring size 8 but none came in 8, and others were way too small.",1
2,Bulgy n the back,0
5,"My wife placed the order and the Boots arrived within 24hrs (at least that what it seemed like). Not only did they fit perfectly, but look GREAT!",1
4,It's a beautiful watch that matches with a lot clothing. I have it 4 stars just because the materials that were made with this watch are decent. I'm pleased with this purchase.,1
1,"They sent a completely different dress. It was the right color but short sleeved, sheer with polka dots, and a hi-low hem. I was desperate for a dress so thought I’d try it on and see if it would work even though it was the wrong one and it was too small and had a big hole where the sleeve attached to the bodice. Also very cheap looking and arrived very wrinkled.",0
5,"I love everything about these pants. They fit great. I ordered a large and they fit perfect. They are comfortable and flattering.  I bought 2 more in different colors. The material is thick but not too thick. Perfect for spring and fall, but I'm wearing them now in the winter too.",1
5,I would go up one more size,1
2,"I love that this purse has a ton of pockets, but unfortunately the pockets on both sides of the purse are identical.  I had to mark one side of the purse to know which way it's facing and which pocket I need to open.  One of the pockets started to rip inside after about 6 weeks of use.",0
1,"Bought and returned b/c I didn't like the size, they charged $15 for shipping!!! What a rip off. Not buying again. Also, my friend has had one for a year now, and the leather finish chips off!",0
5,"I REALLY love this purse, it's been durable and I've had so many compliments on it. I just can't believe that it is now UNAVAILABLE and may not be relisted. PLEASE bring this purse back! Thank you",1
5,Ok,1
1,Have used several and the balls and spikes have broke.,0
4,Great fit. I bought these for a barre fusion class and they are great protection for the higher impact moves. Only thing I wish is that the grip on the bottom of the sock was also on the toe area.,1
5,I like the product. Very happy with my purchase.,1
4,Very cute and bright colors.  Only reason it isn't getting a five is because they run pretry small.,1
3,No comment!,0
5,Looks just like my Wirehair!,1
1,Way bigger than advertised,0
1,I bought this for my daughter for her ballet lessons and after just 1 week of use and just 1 wash it has already begun to unstitch. Not happy with the quality of the product.,0
1,I returned these. They were see through and not supportive at all,0
5,Work great smell great,1
2,Short and cheap,0
1,Great color but not worth it if it rusts within a few days of using it and only getting it wet when washing my hands.  Find another company to buy from.,0
5,"The material is a good quality. It fit perfectly and the costume was delivered real fast! My daughter was so happy when we got it just in time for Halloween. She still like to wear it even after Halloween, it’s her favorite anime character.",1
5,"Love these tops!!! Now I have 4 different colors!  They are loose and light chiffon....love them for work or with jeans!! For the price, you can't beat this top!",1
5,Super cute,1
5,Very nice cotton and fit.,1
4,TOO LARGE FOR A SMALL BABY.  GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER IS 6 1/2 MO OLD AND SLIPPER IS TOO LARGE.  WILL PROBABLY FIT IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.,1
3,Too big.,0
2,Didn't fit well on my granddaughter.,0
4,I bought this wallet so I can just put it in my back pocket and go. I have 2 little ones and I was always losing my wallet in the diaper bag. The size is perfect and the cards go in and out with no struggle. I'm just not a fan of the open slotted middle to put cash it...I'm worried that it will fall out. Overall a good little wallet that fits perfectly in your pocket.,1
1,Bad  (,0
4,"The gloves look nice and are very comfortable, but offer minimal warmth in winter weather. Price is very reasonable, and the colors are compatible with my coats.",1
5,Love the feel and fit of these leggings. They are true high waist and don’t roll down. The material is so soft. I was worried that they wouldn’t fit but I’m a size 20 and had no issues. Love them. Also love the fact that you get 3 for the price!,1
5,It was very much liked as xmas gift!,1
4,Purchased this hat for my 3 year old grand daughter.  Fits well and the pony tail slot works out perfectly. Very pleased with the product.,1
1,I bought these because other ones I've tried have folded in around the thin edges. Usually I just want them to wear with t shirts so it's okay if they aren't perfectly flush with my skin. But these dang things wouldn't stay stuck at all. They would be coming off and sticking to my shirt and it was just a hot mess. I definitely don't recommend.,0
4,Took awhile to come in but excellent tie and has definitely helped me improve my bow tie skills.,1
5,lol i gave these glasses away. a lot of people made fun of me for wearing them .,1
1,"Ordered 3-pack of size large, supposedly 46&#34; long.  What I received, purportedly size large, were belts only 41&#34; long.  Having waited several days for delivery, I'm reluctant to send them back.  This is tremendously disappointing.",0
3,"It was alright, wasn't what I was searching for. It won't go to waste, my granddaughter will receive it.",0
5,These light compression socks are well made and feel great on. I ordered the XL because I am a size 8.5-9 and a large calf but I  plan to order a third pair or two at size L. I believe those will fit even better since I lost a few inches in height over the past few years. But still plan to keep wearing the two pairs of XL I had already purchased. Great product.,1
4,The bottoms didn't close tight enough to avoid running up. Otherwise just fine.,1
5,Love to wear this but has been too windy !,1
5,I ordered the shirt on Tuesday and recieved it on Wednesday.  Great for the price. Thanks,1
5,"Arrived super fast,,,,exactly as pictured ,,,love it : )",1
5,Fits great. No complaints.,1
5,LOVE this dress! It's so thick and warm! I get lots of compliments on it.,1
5,Beautiful lost of compliments,1
5,Looks very good and is priced quite well.,1
2,Runs small. Tight around the waist.,0
5,This suck kept my feet warm and feeling comfortable walking around in it.The materials are really good follow by the design.,1
2,This clips of one of teh earring was already broken when i got it and it wouldnt stay put,0
3,"The shoe feels very comfortable, the fit is great, but the white is not white. It is light gray or taupe even. I'm very disappointed because it looks white online, and is called Bianco. Wth?",0
5,Great little bag. A gift for my daughter. She loves it as well.,1
5,"Color discreto, este vestido se puede usar para trabajar como para ir a una reunión casual!",1
2,"The fabric is pretty ridgid and the color is much brighter blue than it seems, making it look pyjama like.",0
1,Fell apart before I even left the house. DO NOT BUY!,0
5,Sister loved them for her wedding,1
1,I did return sent back the dresses  already because  bad quailty and didnt get my refund,0
3,Runs very tight in the bust. Cheaply made but cute. I would but again if slightly larger in chest area. It’s huge everywhere else. Weird.,0
5,"These shoes are perfect for my five year old daughter she’s loves them. They are cute, comfy, and best of all they are machine washable",1
4,"My feet size us 10 so technically I should get medium however I gotten the large instead and I'm glad I got the large size. It fits just nice, can't imagine if it were medium.",1
4,"Very warm, fits my 7 5/8 head, do not know what the zipper is for, wish it had ear flaps.",1
5,Would buy this again. Well made and looks nice.,1
1,These earrings are TINY.  They would get lost in an infants ear hole.  Description is for the packaging size and doesn't really say how big the earrings are.  Don't buy them unless you are looking for a tiny earring for a 4th hole.,0
1,Pretty but at least 2-3 sizes too small. Too difficult to return,0
5,Love love love and so comfy.,1
3,The waistband it a good fit. Normally I wear between S/M. The short fabric is what makes this awkward. It poofs out around the hips exaggerating your shape but not in a good or sexy way. Makes me look larger than what I am. Kinda dissapointed with the product.,0
3,"I got two blue and one silver band. It’s supposed to be one pink, one blue and one silver. What do I do here??",0
4,Just the right size. The extra strap for stability is nice as well.,1
5,Great!,1
1,Did not like the texture of material and too vinyl,0
5,"So, I found a great strap to swap in, for an aviator style watch.  But, it was a black PVD watch case, and the strap I found had a high polish stainless buckle and tang.<br /><br />Most of the buckles I could find were also polished, even if black, or, in matte black (what I wanted), they tended to have tangs too wide for the strap holes.<br /><br />Thankfully, I found this one, which is not only matte black, but also provides you with TWO tangs, so you can choose if you need a wider or more narrow one (the one I needed).<br /><br />Super easy to install, solid hardware, and, after the switch, it truly looks as if this was tailor made for the strap.<br /><br />A beautiful and strong buckle/tang combo, and I'm very grateful I was able to get this one.<br /><br />Perfect fit on the 22mm strap.  Looks awesome and now makes the strap match the watch case.<br /><br />Highly recommend!",1
1,"Very disappointing.  I have very small wrists, and though the band wasn't too loose, the watch was at least twice as large as I expected it to be.  For a woman's watch it's highly unattractive, as big as any man's watch I've seen.",0
1,My kid is 7 years old and needed the glasses. He loves to play and watch TV. I thought that this product was unbreakable but the frame on the bottom part of the right lense broke,0
1,Ran a bit small and was a very think tank. Unfortunately it was a gift and the person ended up letting her 6 year old daughter have it to wear.,0
3,Over all the hanging bag was as advertised. The only problem I had was with  the smell. It was over powering and very hard to remove. I washed it and sprayed it many times before the smell lightened.,0
5,"Very nice looking charms.  They have heft and size, perfect for my project.",1
3,Sizes run quite small. 9.5 for like an 8.5,0
4,"Like this hat a little on the small side and I have a small head.  Really like the style, so its a keeper.",1
5,Thank you,1
3,Love the shirt but oddly wearing it makes me feel like it should be a PJ shirt instead of a casual shirt.I do love the colors and pattern,0
5,nice quality and value. as described,1
1,I returned this product. The picture shows a golden color. The hat that I received was tan and gold/yellow. The style was nice but color was not true to the picture.,0
1,Ordered a xxl fits my daughter who wears a size M.,0
5,"They provide a huge variety with different gauges.  Only issue is that about half the jewelry is spiked on one end, which isn't my style, but for this price and quantity it's no big deal.",1
1,Very flimsy and bends easily.,0
5,"Nice fit, comfy.",1
3,"Good but I was looking for a cozy one and for winter, this is just an ornament for the head.",0
2,Llegó sin baterías ...,0
4,"Love the colors and design, fits a little small. Wear it often wash and dry it and it seems to hold up well. Had it for 2 months now.",1
1,𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕓𝕚𝕘 𝕚𝕟 𝕥𝕓𝕖 𝕝𝕖𝕘𝕤 𝕟 𝕥𝕠𝕠 𝕙𝕚𝕘𝕙 𝕦𝕡 𝕠𝕟 𝕥𝕦𝕞𝕞𝕪,0
2,"Literally will not cover boobs. I got a size small, I’m 5’6” and 115#. Size 34D. Definitely didn’t cover my boobs at all. Cute back. It’s 100% a thong. Too bad the chest coverage isn’t practical bc I really liked the actual suit. Doesn’t cover boobs. Unless you want nipples out or wear a bandeau.",0
1,IT’s comfy but the shirt is itchy I washed it and it’s still itchy for some reason!!,0
5,"This is the dress I was looking for, perfect size and comfort. 🖤",1
5,"I travel for a living and bought these to keep in my suitcase for warm climates. They ended up becoming my favorite sandals and I wear them all the time, even at home. Just wish they were real leather.",1
1,It was black...it was thin...and too large for a medium...will return the belt,0
3,"The reviews on this product don't really help and but I am giving you the honest truth hear. You get what your pay for! The metal bar one, has some type of coating and it peels off after few wears also instead of 3 different necklaces, its one big thing AND IT TANGLES. THE TANGLING IS UNBEARABLE. You can't even wear it for 20 minutes with out it tangling. If your crafty you can fix it up with out a problem so its not too bad but if you want a quality everyday necklace this isn't it.",0
5,Great for work!,1
5,Goodly-thick padding for sure.  Thickest of the thick padding.  Double thick for the man who has no ass.  I can ride for hours now.  Doubles as an extremely efficient flatulence filter.,1
5,"Perfect onesie to have as a costume or just to lounge around in, whichever makes the os tod the product because of the price.",1
5,I use this for myself. Fits all my curves.,1
5,Help with foot pain,1
2,A little disappointed!<br />Just got them in and it doesn't do justice :-(,0
5,it was a gift and she really liked it and so does a lot of other women who sees it on her arm.,1
2,"The dress feels very cheap. Also, it is very wide at the top.",0
1,It so not go,0
5,Love it! Looks great on me! Accentuates my positive areas instead of my negatives! I'm 5'6 and the length is good. I went with a large based on my measurements & it looks great!,1
3,"I liked it but it was too snug, even after ordering a XL for my 12/14 size frame.  It would have been great had I not gained these additional ice cream pounds.  Dress was lovely but had to be returned.  It also does not indicate that there is an opening in the back which prevents you from wearing a bra.  I CANNOT allow these puppies to run free or they will be at my navel.",0
3,"It's very cute, but the color sent does not match the color in the picture. I bought the one that looked purple, but if was actually a pink dress.",0
3,"For the Harry Potter fan,for sure! kinda feel apart soon after we received it. But it's cute!",0
3,These run small.  I was rather disappointed in the pants because it took a long time prewashing them in cold water to get the color to stop running.  They aren’t very heavy so I don’t know how long they will last.  The high waist is great until you bend over and the waist folds over.,0
3,Wish I was warned it stretches a lot would have bought size smaller,0
5,Perfect for industrial work.,1
5,Love this blouse!!,1
3,Beautiful rings. But Turned fingers green.,0
1,Was not as long brimmed. As we needed. The cap was well made and the company was awesome to deal with when I returned it.,0
1,"Do not buy this item.  It smells awful, like fish.  The sparkles come off EVERYwhere, and everything breaks.  We threw it in the trash by the second day. Steer clear!!",0
2,The coat is pretty. And my daughter loved it. But almost instantly the zipper completely broke and I was very disappointed.,0
5,I bought many snaps and bracelets to share with friends.  They loved them.,1
2,They look good but for a bit too small,0
5,My feet are a Lil bit wider than normal size of 9.5 but it fits perfectly on my feet. Also very light.,1
3,"The glasses are nice, Except I ordered 250 and got 300.",0
5,"They are light, they wash very well, and we are ordering more!!",1
2,"Love the look of the sunglasses themselves, but they're not very durable. The arms of the glasses could definitely fit tighter. They were loose on me and a screw came out the first time I wore them, which caused the lense to not be supported. I never found the screw that went to the sunglasses, but I did fix them with a screw I already had.  The second time I wore them, after removing them from my sunglass case (they do not come with a case by the way), where they'd been protected, I realized another screw was missing, but I got lucky and recovered it from the case. I put the screw  back into the sunglasses and it has stayed so far. Will not order again, and might return these if I have any more problems.",0
5,Bike shorts fit very well. Bought them for my granddaughter who is 2 yrs old.,1
2,maded cheaply,0
5,Loved it. My baby was Beautiful on her 1st Birthday!,1
3,"I did not like how this dress fitted. Further, the fabric is not of good quality- it is too soft. Would rather that it was a tougher fabric.",0
5,"I haven't gotten it in the water yet, but it fits great and feels like good quality material. The peplum style us really cute and great for bloated tummies.",1
1,One washing and they shrunk 3 sizes.  Could not even get them on my feet.,0
5,thanks,1
3,"As another reviewer stated by complaint is with the shoe and most definitely not with the seller. My shoes arrived promptly and as promised. However, they did not fit the same as the previous versions of the Dyad. I've had at least 4 versions and always found them very comfortable with plenty of room at the toe to accommodate my foot. These feel smaller and squish my toes very u comfortably. I hope Brooks will go back to the previous design.",0
4,Moved around a little .,1
2,"The sweatshirt was a little too big, so I don't like it",0
1,"to small for me, so have to return and but cute",0
2,Turns out to be super ugly and not a thing like the picture. The material was weird and not like the other 2 different colored ones I got from the same seller.,0
5,"Nice quality, clear plastic tasting cups! Used them for a beer tasting themed party and they were perfect! They stack together for easy carrying. Would highly recommend for multiple servings/guests when glassware would not be practical.",1
5,"Just perfect, better than the ones that came with the boot when I bought  them.",1
5,"This belt fits nice and looks nice.  It snugs up my waistline without cramping it and holds my pants up great.  I hope that because of the web material instead of leather to buckle it, it will not get worn out like some of my previous belts that were not good quality.  I love it.",1
4,pretty!,1
5,Bought for my 8 year old to wear with his adjustable fins.  They fit very well and he was comfortable swimming around.  Also very nice for walking on hot sand/rough surfaces after getting out of the water.,1
1,Not what I was expecting. I ordered a small. The top was waaaay too big. It came with no tag...I’m pretty positive it was not a small... The dress overall seemed cheap. The top was super thin and the bottom was super thick and a totally different fabric. Sending mine back for a refund.,0
1,I ordered XL and couldn’t even zip it... runs way small.. need a 2XL,0
1,The headband part was broken when it arrived and the top of the hat had came apart.,0
3,Did not like the padding in the top. It should of been stitched down it moves. The pant came a bit too large wished it had a string in the waist.,0
2,"I can’t put these on! They are so difficult to put on, I don’t know if it’s me. I really like them, but won’t be able to wear them.",0
2,"Super, super cheap. They break quickly. Good as a party favor or for a weekend away when you don't want to bring your expensive sunglasses.",0
4,"kinda heavy , backs loose",1
1,I bought an XL it looks like a small,0
3,Not too bad,0
5,Shirt is soooo soft and comfortable. It’s fits good. I get a lot of compliments on it.,1
5,"Gave these to a friend as a gift.  She loves the fit, the style, and the ability to use her phone with them on.  She's happy; I'm happy.",1
1,"This looks very beautiful but it is a real choker. Very uncomfortable.<br />I returned the one I purchased and would recommend it only for its beauty and uniqueness. Other than that, it is not comfortable on the neck.",0
1,[[VIDEOID:50f71afb8550c4507395165f594fd112]] I just received it today and saw that there are holes ☹️ I’m so disappointed because the cloth was nice and soft.,0
5,I like it,1
1,"I ordered Ava and got Samantha! Quality seems mediocre, but the script is as pretty as pictured. Too bad it's not the right name. From other reviews it looks like I'm not the only person this happened to.",0
5,So beautiful and much bigger then I though I loved the look of it.,1
1,These fell apart after my first wear and wash. Total waste of money!,0
3,I purchased one for myself in size 7 and loved it. Everything was well coated in SS and I wear it every day. I bought one for my daughter in size 6 and it came completely blackened on the inside - no SS coating whatsoever. Had to return it. Very disappointing. So I'm averaging the reviews to a 3.,0
3,"Wasn't what I was looking for, the color was quite different that what wasexpected",0
2,The first time I wore these the inside lining comes out in small pieces. It happens every time I wear them and I haven’t even washed them yet!,0
5,"This is a great shirt, fits really well and the fabric is a good quality.",1
4,"Do really like these titanium 6mm hoops, esp the click close for nose piercings. Glad they came in a 2 pk tho, one closes very tightly with no issues but the other one came out of my eyebrow piercing in 2 days time so idk if that one was just a dud. My fault in sizing- my nose is extremely small & for the tight fit I'm looking for I realized after I got this I need a 5mm & really wish this co made one that size in titanium since I can't use stainless. Found ano co that does offer one but I prefer this one for how tightly it closes & stays closed, well at least the one does.",1
5,Did not fit SGW-100B-3A2CF without modification with a Dremel tool.,1
1,Everything broke after 2 weeks.  Cheap crap!,0
2,It's made a little cheap but sterdy. I hung mine on my rearview mirror.,0
5,Nice heavy watch. Keeps time.  Had it for a few months now. Great dress watch,1
2,It looks like a guys shirt. It’s to big and it doesn’t flatter unless you use it as pajama shirt,0
1,"These are not compression socks, more like tube sock material. I wear a womens 8.5 shoe and these are way, way too big in the foot, but then the design on the rest of the sock looks all stretched out (for reference I'm 5'5"" 125 lbs).  Made in China.  I requested a refund.",0
1,"Ugly, nothing like pivot<br />C have gaudy metal",0
1,Very disappointed !!! Button kept falling off vest also had a rip and was pulling away from the threading,0
2,Cheap material. Already ripped.,0
2,Es muy fragil se rompio rapido,0
5,Adorable high quality pewter charm for jewelry and more.,1
5,"Updated review.  Amazing customer service, which you don't see much these days.<br />Slim and discrete allowing multiple ways to wear.  The multiple pockets allow you to safely hold items, for ex: can keep I'd or small bills in front pocket/s without having to get out your full wallet, etc....  definitely recommend this product!",1
5,I am in love with these compression socks. I work 12hr shifts and these definitely keep my feet from swelling. They don't make my feet smell like the Lycra compression socks.,1
2,I loved the way this dress fit me. It was very comfortable and flattering but the material used was so cheap looking almost like a tablecloth or bedsheets. So disappointed because it could have been such a great dress. Don’t waste your time/ money with this one!,0
1,"The material is very soft, but it seemed to run extremely small.  I am keeping it because it's just easier than sending it back, but I wouldn't want anyone to see wearing it because it's so tight.",0
1,One of the cheapest shades I've seen or bought.,0
4,pretty close to what I was looking for.  I am satisfied.,1
2,Not correctly sized. Gift for a friend with 00 ears and all of these were too small,0
5,Product arrived on time and fit comfortably and didn’t effect peripheral vision like I was concerned that it might!!! Definitely recommend,1
2,This thing is literally see through. No one wants to buy a cute dress for school and then have to wear a slip under it. I mean sure its comfortable and cute but its only comfortable if you don't mind wearing it alone and having everyone know the brand of your underwear.,0
5,Great watch love it professional look,1
3,"These jewelry pieces are pretty cute, however after wearing them in my nostril for a while Ive noticed the gems unscrew very easily.",0
1,"The material its made of is very stretchy t-shirt like and very, very poor quality.<br />the size is way too big and it does not have any shape to it.",0
5,This dress fit as expected . It is very stretchy . I love how this dress is cut in the front to give some cleavage but not too much. I usually am a 2x it fit nice not too big at all. The price online is affordable also.,1
1,"Was advertised as cutting glare at night. Sad to say, I didn't notice a reduction in glare at all",0
1,It has permanent creases from being folded up and stuffed in a tiny package for shipping. Its a very tight fit that does not stretch and the material feels delicate and thin. The thing weighs nothing but there is a huge return shipping fee? It took 3 weeks to arrive. So if you buy it you will lose money if you return it. Buy any other hat from any other seller.,0
2,I was so excited to get this shirt.  After reading the reviews it seems to be a mixed signal whether this shirt is too small a little small or just right. Let me put the debate to rest. I ordered a 2xl I am a firm 2xl.  The shirt is maybe a size large. I could possibly fit half my upper body in this tiny thing.  Severely disappointed and don't want anyone else to be.  Cute but bigger girls DO NOT ORDER.  Smaller girls size up 2 sizes maybe 3.,0
5,Pockets!!!!!,1
5,Love these shirts!,1
2,"The hay is soft, has a good color and looks like the picture. The actual graphic on the hat feels like a sticker.",0
5,A gift to my adult daughter for her b'day in her birth stone and she loves it! I knew she would since I enjoy my own so much. Gave her the earrings that match for Christmas so she has a new 'set'.,1
2,The entire lens is magnified as opposed to just the lower portion,0
5,If you love designer/casual...this is great!,1
3,"While it's a bit smaller than expected, it still fits perfect!",0
5,Nice sweatshirt. Highly recommend easy to wash and good material. Fast shipping,1
3,Not good quality,0
1,"My first review didn't get posted a few days ago, so I'm resubmitting it. I noticed that the main title on this pendant now says ""silver alloy"", which is how I described it. 🧐<br /><br />I don't have the photos, but will check the cloud.<br /><br />I already sent this back as a return.<br />It's not Sterling Silver, it is junk alloy. It's very poor quality, uneven and thin. You can see the imperfections in the molding process. It was not in a fabric pouch as described.",0
1,"Great looking watch for the price, but will not run through the night. Every morning the watch has stopped and the time needs to be reset. Look elsewhere.",0
1,Too small and poor quality.  Complete waste of time and money.,0
5,Fits true to size,1
5,Fits well and very comfortable.  Length is just right for casual dress and goes well with other items.  Straps adjust easily and stay in place wtih movement.  Would recommend it for those looking to wear it under something or as a casual top..,1
4,Tad bit small but great price.,1
1,comfortable just a little big.,0
5,Very good quality y perfect size. Soft material and confortable to use every day,1
3,Great wearing glasses and all for price. Just disappointed in the leg breaking without any stringent action on them,0
4,"I was unsure at first because the price was so reasonable, after my first 16 hour shift, I knew I spent my money well. They are saving my feet and legs. I plan to buy more",1
5,I really like this tights the material is so soft and comfy and the pockets are an added bonus.,1
5,True to size and soft feel. Worked great.,1
3,Nice Great leather but the prong attachment which secures the band keeps popping off and actually lead to my watch falling off and scratching at the front glass,0
5,"Very nice, good fit, well made",1
4,Beautiful skirt. The colors are beautiful!!  Fits wonderful and it has been washed with not change in size.  Good quality,1
3,"La cintura del vestido me queda un poco arriva, a mi gusto debe ser mas abajo. El tono del color no fue el esperado, aunque son parecidos no son iguales el de la foto de su catalogo y el que me llego, sobretodo el color del liston de la cintura.",0
5,We live on a street that has a storm drain right in front of our house. I put the mask in it to look like PennyWise and it looks great for Halloween.  Well made and much more reasonably priced than the others.  Super scary looking.,1
5,easy to put on,1
5,"The threading is great. They are thicker than my original leggings. Very comfortable, yet supportive",1
2,"This serves the purpose and nothing more.  When I first received it, I tried to change the combination on the lock (per the instructions) only to have the lever you push get stuck so couldn't change the combination or close the case.  My husband finally got it free, but it is still very hard to open.  If I was a jewelry sales person, I would not use this case to display my wares.  It looks nothing like faux leather, more like plastic-embossed covered cardboard.  The only redeeming factors are that the necklace loops actually keep your necklaces untangled and there is a lot of space in the bottom to store unusually shaped jewelry.",0
1,mounting bracket broke on first day,0
4,Okay once washed kinda small,1
2,Necklace missing from package.,0
5,"Son súper lindos, deportivos y cómodos",1
1,"Very unflattering.  I'm fairly thin and this literally stuck straight out at my hips,  like two huge triangles.",0
5,These are nice!! Definitely worth the money love the quality too. More than likely getting another design from this company.,1
5,I love this dress far more than I thought. I want more colors!,1
5,Very pretty dupatta with beautiful work! I loved the glass work in the duptta!,1
5,Very nice bracelet,1
5,Great timer watch and fits all ages and sizes. Holes on wrist start from the bottom all the way to top,1
3,Not as green - by any stretch of the imagination - as shown. Nice size.,0
5,This purse is so stylish! It has just enough space for my items when I don't want to carry just a few essentials and don't want to take my big handbag. The pearl handle really adds to it. I love it!!,1
5,"I like this bag for Home Health. It is not super big, so it prevents me from over-filling it with too much stuff. The middle holds my vitals bag, and gloves, and a few wound items. The side has a vinyl pocket area for scissors, swabs, wipes, penlight, etc. It's easy to keep clean, and it's not too heavy.",1
5,Fits great  hard to find band that fits large/xl wrist,1
1,"Fabric was not great quality at all, and the way it fit was uncomfortable.  I didn’t even wear it.  Super disappointed and dissatisfied.",0
1,Huge,0
5,"I wore it for my disco cowgirl Bach and it was a hit! Purchased a 2XL, could’ve gone with a 1XL.",1
3,These are extremely cute.  But you must order one size up.,0
3,"I bought this backpack for my mom so she would be able to change from a tote to a backpack however, the straps were not very comfortable for a back pack, the purse itself has a lot of room and is super cute!",0
5,Love them,1
1,One of them broke after a week . I loved them to,0
3,Quality ok. Measurements around thigh area are uneven on both sides and makes it uncomfortable,0
1,Followed instructions and they still don't stay in. Look good if they would actually stay in.,0
5,Fits well,1
3,I gave this 3 stars STRICTLY because of the length.  It is cute...bit definitely not as long as the picture.  My daughter is 4ft 10 and it go to her thighs.,0
4,"This is a great hoodie, and fits loose and a bit boxy, like in the picture. Color is also as pictured. Based on others' reviews, I sized up, but wish I hadn't. I am 5'6"", 135 lbs, 36C, and ordered the medium. It's bigger than I'd been wanting (loads of extra room in the chest and quite long arms), but I decided to keep it for lounging around on cold days, as it's nice to ball my hands up in the long sleeves, and it's roomy enough to wear over a sweater. It's a dumpier look than I'd been going for, but very cozy. Seems like good quality.",1
5,Love this case!  Fits phone perfectly.  Adjustable strap is perfect length.  Does not look cheap!,1
5,Excellent product,1
1,"I ordered XL and it came in the the size of a shirt my daughter wears. She is 14 years old, size 2 in pants and wears youth Medium. It fits her perfectly.  I will not buy from this company again.",0
5,I found the piece of good quality for the price charged,1
5,Wish I could afford more! I love this shirt,1
1,They will not slip over existing pads.,0
3,"This dress is cute, but it does run small. I usually wear a L/XL, but ordered an XXL based on previous reviews. The hips, arms, waist, and length of this dress all fit well. The chest, however, is too tight with puckering and opening happening around the buttons.<br /><br />The length of this dress is really nice. I'm 5 ft 5 in, and it hits at a very flattering point below my knees. The ruffle on the chest is really nice, and the buttons are functional. There is also a side zipper to make putting it on easier. The fabric is a bit thin, but it was not see through. The fabric was a bit stiff, but I would assume it would soften over time. The cut is flattering. All in all, this is a nice dress, but I don't know if it will be useable for me with the way the chest fits. It would be perfect for someone with a smaller chest.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review. This does not influence my opinion at all.",0
2,a little flimsier than I thought-I must not have read the description correctly,0
5,They add extra special look to the dress. I just love these belts. The package they came un is really cute. I would recommend this to others. Its a very good add to your wardrobe.,1
5,It was a gift and the recipient was extremely happy. Her brother’s name is David so that’s pretty funny!,1
5,"beautiful anklets, different styles good for matching for different clothing. could wear on both wrist and ankle. like them very much",1
3,"Extremely see through, cheap material too high for the price.",0
1,returned it,0
5,Wear to work on my feet 9 hours a day legs don’t hurt an very warm love them my son in law wears them hunting very warm,1
5,They were absolutely beautiful!  She loved them and so did her Mom!  They were even nicer in person!!!  WOW!,1
1,Broke after 2 days,0
5,Fits just right.  Husband loved it! True to size.,1
3,"Note that material is see thru - even in black. Made in China. The fit is different, wider all over and not tapered at the waist like the photo,  so may return these.",0
5,Large fit perfecr,1
5,These things are great,1
5,"Doesn’t irritate my skin like the original band that came with my Fitbit blaze, and it fits perfectly.",1
2,I would give the quality 5 stars but the fit was way off. Way too small for a size 5 medium. So,0
5,Beautiful watch and works well,1
1,"Very small, short length, no heel or toe...",0
3,"This robe is fine.  It's a little small for me but not obscenely.  I would just have preferred a little more material.  And the material is not particularly soft and is also thin - it feels almost disposable or something that someone might find at a clinic.  Still, it does the job.",0
5,"These tights are very comfortable and fit perfectly. They provide warmth and comfort to the foot. They don’t ride down when you wear them and stay in place while providing tummy control. They are good looking leggings and go well with any top you want to wear them with. They give with your body so they are good for many activities or just for lounging. Chic and attractive, these are my go to leggings for everyday style and fashion.",1
1,"Absolute garbage. Took the back off to install the enclosed battery only to find on e already installed. Now I can't get the back on no matter what I try. Seems to be an ok watch, just hope you never have to change the battery.",0
5,BEAUTIFUL THANKS YOU¡,1
5,Love it!,1
5,These were very good knock off click reading glasses. I especially liked the rubber connector in the back.,1
4,Was ordered for a wedding and it met the bride's approval.,1
5,"These are the nose studs I've been searching for. I've had my nose pierced for 15 years and I've tried all types. I really hate the bent ones and some have too big of a ball at the end which can be painful. These have a small ball at the end that are easy to put in but stays in place.<br /><br />I've been wearing the smaller of the studs for a few days now and it has not fallen out. It's small and doesn't have any rough edges like a lot of studs do, so it doesn't easily catch on clothes, washcloths or hair. It has prongs on 4 sides, that hold the stone in so I'm fairly confident these will last awhile. Cheap ones usually just have the stone glued in. The stone is bright clear and sparkly, these look really nice on.<br /><br />These are great if you have a fairly new piercing (past the healing stage) because they're stainless steel and hypoallergenic. The smaller of the two is nice for work if you work in a conservative environment.<br /><br />I do think the price is a little steep but I pay $1 for studs that don't last much time, so investing in good quality ones that you'll get some months out of is probably a good idea. I can't seem to find this size anywhere local or this great of quality so I will absolutely purchase again.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I was in no way compensated and have no incentive to leave either a positive or negative review. These are my personal thoughts on this product.",1
5,Product held up very well on a recent overseas trip even after TSA got in my luggage. Love the fact they were orange was able to tell my suitcases were on the baggage system. Takes a little time to figure out and adjust the first time after the first time go on very quickly. Bought two.,1
3,Too small,0
1,"It’s extremely durable material. Love that! However,  the bottom measures at 26”. WAY small. If their medium means small than they got it perfect! As it hit middle of that per size chart. Aka  I purchased medium. They need to fix their chart!!!!!! Very frustrated now I have to return or give to little sister as you can see it’s not just small in the waist but looks like a 12 year old height too! I’m not tall either I’m 5’4” You think you find a good brand/company. Nope! I’ll keep look elsewhere.  Gave a 2 only because of the material.<br /><br />Review for the top: I GOT A LARGE. DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A LARGE TO ANYONE!! Literally all their products ARE small no matter what you choose!!!!<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE! (Never have I ever said that! My money is everything aka I think about something 3 times before I buy it. I make sure it will work. AND even on top of that plan for shite to happen as it’s online shopping. BUT did not  expect to buy a large and get a 26” top aka small.)<br /><br />That 2 was originally just for the pants bottoms but now the large is a small too. Wow. Wish I could put my 2 star to -2!!!",0
3,Watch band a bit too stiff,0
5,I bought these to traverse the tile hallway to make my morning coffee and because they were so bloody cute!  I am saving a pair for when I have to wash the other.  One pair of hearts matches my bathroom carpet.  Can you get any better than that??,1
5,Good price. Good fit. Nice finish. I would recommend.,1
2,scratchy polyester.<br />why do boy shorts seem backward?<br />they're longer in the front than the back.<br />I have others that are fine.<br />giving the entire package away.,0
5,Nice! Its very slimming,1
2,"much smaller than i had imangined it to be, so i returned it",0
5,The wing charmed necklace is perfect! I love the that the chain is adjustable. It is very small but I have a smaller frame so it’s very cute. The package is a very touch and would be able to personalized if you will be giving as a gift. I wish I would be able order a matching set of earrings.,1
5,"Bought for my granddaughter, she LOVES it!",1
2,Very much a balloon sleeve. Weird gathering at the shoulders. Material on the inside is not good.,0
4,"This is a very pretty dress, arrived quickly & looks like good quality. The only problem I had was that even with following their size guide the dress was still too big on me.<br /><br />I am 145 lbs ordered a size 10 and it was a bit too loose and I don’t have time to alter it so unfortunately I had to return it.<br /><br />I do recommend this seller and dress over all its a good purchase.",1
5,I use to hate to drive at night but the head lights of on coming cars don’t bother me anymore.,1
3,I really liked this product but from day 1 had problems putting the item on my Gear S2.  I like to change the bank every so often but this last time when I pushed in the button the bank came off but the attachment was still attached to my S2.  It was very difficult to remove this piece.,0
3,"Love the look of the bag, but zipper broke after 2 days use.",0
1,"Broke within 15 minutes of opening, cheap device for its price.",0
4,I haven't had the chance to wear it yet but I tried it on and I like the look.  It's very different from anything else that I own.,1
5,"I love how these fit over my glasses, and still look so stylish. Great find. My favorite sunglasses ever! So much so, I'm going to buy another pair!",1
2,Though I like the bag it doesn't look anything like its pictured!,0
5,go up a size maybe need more length just a little,1
5,Very pretty but made for ladies 30 years old and UNDER.  This dress is very see through must wear a slip and underwear.,1
5,Perfect!!!,1
3,Love it. It's basically a cross body. The storage part is bigger than expected. But I love it!,0
4,The fit is larger than expected. It is not as warm as I had hope for but will be fine.,1
5,So comfortable. Love the waistband… pulls that belly roll in a bit. But a long shirt is required because pantry lines will show if you’re worried about that.,1
4,The material is good quality. The fabric feels like Speedo sports towel. The sizing is way too big. It's probably made for someone who's at least 160 to 230 pounds and about 5.9  to 6.4 feet tall.,1
2,"These sunglasses are mirrored on both sides, making it difficult to wear while driving.",0
5,perfect for any age I think. fits just as described and washes up so great.<br /> my waist is a little bigger than the small but I  ordered it anyway because<br />I do sew and added  2&#34; of  elastic as any kid learns in sewing class [basic sewing 101,1
5,"A very good solution when you are in the airport travelling with family. Always with tons of documents, prints of the airline tickets, reservations, tours, vouchers, travell authorizations, cards, eye contact boxes, keys, etc etc etc.<br />As this is transparent plastic you don't loose time looking, and you don't need to open one hundred of times to double check where are the documents, the keys, te reservations etc. hahahhaa<br /><br />The quality if very good both the plastic and the zipper.<br /><br />The size is very good, not small and not too big.<br /><br />I recommend it.",1
3,"Jewelry was pretty, but the chains were damaged slightly, and the keychain was broken. The sword and sheath fit together, but it doesn't lock together so it just falls out.",0
5,This was a perfect Easter gift for one of my daughter's following a recent cruise.  We had an excursion with a swim with the dolphins.  Great gift as a follow up reminder.,1
3,Did not like how they fit on me,0
2,"The material was nice. But it was way too big. It came days later than expected so even if it did for, I wouldn't have been able to wear it to my event.",0
3,"Buscaba un reloj que evocara la década de los años 70 y me llamó la atención esta reedición de Orient. Lamentablemente al verlo en persona y ponérmelo en la muñeca me siento raro y tal vez es porque el reloj no se ve de buena calidad. La maquinaria debe ser buena por tratarse de un Orient, pero los terminados no me convencieron. No es un reloj particularmente deportivo, la resistencia al agua es de solo 50 m y el cristal no es zafiro, aunque esto ya se sabía por las especificaciones. Queda como testimonio de época pero sinceramente no creo que lo use mucho.",0
5,Exactly what I wanted and needed.,1
1,This very nice but does not working.,0
5,"When I received these pants, they were somewhat wrinkled, but I hung them over a chair and they became a little bit more unwrinkled and then when I wore them they became even more unwrinkled so that was awesome. Fabric is super soft and I’m tall 5 foot 10 1/2 and I’m going to not put these in the dryer let them hang dry based on the other reviews I would definitely highly recommend these pants super comfy, and great pockets",1
4,This is a great value for the money.  It’s not the best out there but it’s pretty good and a great value for our 6 year old to finish out his soccer season.,1
1,Much smaller than advertised,0
2,"There are three attractive pairs of glasses in this box along with one cleaning cloth. The box says they are rated for UV400 but that is definitely not true. I also did not notice any anti-glare feature. These were a bit uncomfortable to wear because the right ear arm on each frame will not open all the way. I kept trying to open it but would hear some cracking. Other than this, they work as reading glasses. In my opinion,  the current price of $15.59 comes to $5.20 per pair which I feel is too expensive due to the marginal quality.",0
5,Awesome bag cheap price,1
4,Nice watch and cheaper price,1
2,This watch set is very nice looking. The down fall to this set is that they run very small as they are made in China.  My wrist circumference is 6.5 and the fit is very tight and umcomfortable.,0
5,"Great for the price! Keeps the sun out of my eyes and looks great. The lenses can reflect things around you so that is something to get used to. They are also sturdier than I expected, which is good. Mine came with a little cloth carrying case and a cloth to clean the lenses. Very pleased with these.",1
1,Cheap plastic watch. Broke in 4 months. SMH,0
1,Earrings are very difficult to get on and fall off easily and constantly.,0
5,Nice,1
4,Super comfy…I’ve worn these a ton since ordering!,1
2,"This is not a sweatshirt, it’s satin.",0
2,"I am 5ft 2in and 110lbs. The small fit me perfectly, the material wasn't stretched out over parts of my body and didn't bag anywhere. The material is thick enough so it is not see through, but your bra lines will still show<br /><br />I am returning it because the neckline is awkward. It goes much higher than pictured, and does not look as flattering on me as a lower neckline would.",0
1,Ugly,0
3,"I've used several different refracting glasses and these were not horrible but the refraction could have been more pronounced. However, for the price, I was able to get 100 and hand them out during the holidays so kids could view Christmas lights with them - they seemed to enjoy them.",0
5,"They arrived earlier than expected and they made my day. This earings are a hit for anyone who considers him\herself an elephant lover. Bigger than expected, nicely handcrafted...I just loved them!!",1
1,It’s just thin poorly made stockings for your hands and it was already fraying at the ends and about to tear the first time I put them on. Complete and utter waste of money. Never ever buy them,0
5,So cute,1
5,I used them and they are perfect comfortable easy to put on and clean great product at a fair price,1
1,It looked great; however the watch band springs immediately broke when installing.,0
5,Great!,1
3,"Very bright and showy, almost distracting. But it does make a statement.",0
5,Actually ordered another 2 pair because that's how much I like them. Nicely made and nice material.,1
5,"the chain is very thing and cheap but it’s super cute and you get what you paid for, I saw it on Amazon for $30!!! And I got it for $1 definitely worth it.",1
2,"I ordered a couple different colors of this tank top.  The material is of poor quality.  It's already pilling after wearing once.  It fits too tight.  Some kind of stretchy material.  I don't like the material, length or fit.  I should have returned them.",0
3,Not touchscreen compatible,0
4,I got this little outfit for my 7 month old baby. I got a size 6-12 months and I can say it runs a little big. It’s cute but I don’t know if I feel 100% satisfied with it...,1
1,"I really loved this shirt, it was beautiful, soft, fit well. HOWEVER, after only wearing it a few times the front of the shirt completely shredded and pulled away from the placket. This shirt was never in the dryer. I owned it for less than 2 months. What a waste of money.",0
5,Gorgeous.... for the price super duper ... no complaints,1
3,This makes a nice little grab bag gift for a girls tea party or gift exchange. Put in a window and enjoy the rainbows.,0
5,Love it &#60;3,1
5,My boyfriend ordered these and I can’t wait to see him wear them . Seems like good quality,1
5,Great deal,1
2,"This fit was kind of sack like on me. I have broad shoulders, a large bust, and slightly narrow hips. The bows on the shoulders are not nearly as delicate as what the picture depicts on the model. The waist didn't sinch in quite as nicely either. I had a hard time finding measurements that worked best for my build. I think this might look good on someone just not me.",0
4,"Shiny, beautiful, great price, stunning in person",1
2,no strong  its oaky for 2weeks my be,0
2,Print has the smell of garbage that cannot be washed out. Never had this issue in a shirt ever.,0
5,I have these as back up pair . The size and measurements make for the right fit,1
3,I bought a large because medium was not available but I'm glad I did. The large definitely fits like a medium. Overall I think it's nice but not ecstatic about it.,0
5,Very nice,1
1,Broke as soon as I got it out of the package.,0
1,Poor material. The strap broken easy . No safety  to wear.,0
5,My son has been using Amazon to order all his piercing equipment yes certified thank goodness! He always had great things to say about all these cages and how light but great they are,1
5,this bracelet does inspire and it helps with New Year resolutions:)..great way to stay focused.,1
5,great loved it,1
2,the color is a wierd reddish orange and do not like the quality of the material.,0
3,"I have used the waist trainer for about 2 wks and even though the fit is good( I ordered a L--I'm 5'6&#34;,148lbs) the rods on the front have both broken through the fabric and have been discarded. I can still wear it and it still provides some back support.",0
5,"These are awesome. They’re just stretchy enough to be comfortable, but not so stretchy that they fall off. They aren’t see through at all. The seams in the buttocks are a little odd so that takes some getting used to but otherwise they’re fantastic. I am 5’7” and 140 lbs, and I got a medium.",1
1,Even though these socks are supposed to fit from size 10 to 12. I wear a size 11 and they are falling off my feet. Completely unusable,0
3,This dress is very okay. It is about as good as you would expect for such an inexpensive price. The fabric is not very breathable and I only got a couple of wears out of it before the colors ran and the fabric pilled. This dress was cute the first time I wore it but I would not recommend it for summer because my sweating ruined it,0
1,Too tight/small,0
5,The leather is soft and very light.  Everything that used to fit in my large wallet fits perfectly in this one that is 1/3 of the size.  My pocketbook is not as heavy now!,1
3,Nice looking leggings for a good price.  Unfortunately these kept sliding off my backside which was very annoying.  The fitting was 'off'.,0
5,I like it,1
2,button with charger fell off after a week.,0
3,It was strangely tight on the chest ( I don't have a big chest either) and very loose everywhere else (as expected). The shoulder straps are too short too. This would work great on a girl with little to no chest. I'm a 36B ( big ribs) and did not look good!,0
5,"My young sister wanted a wolf like animal hood for christmas. It was hard to find what she was requesting so found this one on amazon and was delighted. Order it, came in time, and was wrapped for christmas. My sister unwrapped it and her face was full of excitement and was better than she requested. I even was please with it as well. I think it is better made than the ones i saw in the stores. She loved it and it looks so cute. Very soft/fluffy and the colors are just awesome looking.",1
1,"So in terms of how cannon the cosplay looks it’s extremely accurate. However, you can’t ignore the poor sewing that was done for mine in particular. It sounds like nobody else had this issue with having holes, freakishly long fingers, and a wide thumb area. I don’t know if it’s just a specific thing with my cosplay but it’s still not good quality control.",0
2,I bought this watch and the package and case was completely damaged and the watch was running. I own a few Nixon watches and they always come with a spacer on the dial as a battery saver until it’s removed. This one didn’t have one so I had no idea how much battery life was left and I could not give it as a gift because of how damaged and banged up the case was. I ordered a replacement and sent the first one back only to realize that the second one wasn’t working at all so therefore I’m sending that back too. Very disappointing. I’m not sure they’re authentic either.,0
5,"This hat is insanely cute. It reminds me of garden-party and &#34;picture&#34; hats of old, and it will be perfect to keep the sun out. Without the brim it turns into what I call a &#34;boonie hat&#34; (no chin strap, though). I'm going to wear this a lot over the summer.",1
5,Great socks and great price. I have a small foot and socks fit perfectly. Underwood1267@verizon. Will be purchasing more.,1
2,this is our second pair.  Its a good shoe but the delivery is out 2 months....2 months!!!!!! and all they say is running late.  He'll have outgrown it by the time it gets here.  Would not buy again,0
3,"[[VIDEOID:42c411b3665534f446e85ec78892b198]] Very disappointed with the minor defect, yes, it’s minor but it makes the bag unusable. My husband uses it for quick errands with our baby daughter and only carries 4 diapers, wipes, powder, spit rag and his wallet. The plastic holder that holds the strap must be defective, it keeps popping off and my husband isn’t able to use it. Other than that, the quality of the material is great. We’d LOVE the bag if it weren’t for the defect.",0
5,"And he loves them! I honestly didn't think he would wear them. Low key purchased them for him, but for me, because I really expected him to not wear them at all. Joke was on me. He loves them, and wears them everyday, all day, unless he's working.",1
4,Love them,1
3,It rolls when you sit. although the material its good doesn't prevent from rolling!,0
4,"I did like this dress, but wasn’t my favorite of the ones I ordered for an office Christmas party. Construction is good. Material is ok. I felt it wrinkled a little easier than expected.",1
3,"I am short so this was quite long on me.  The elastic in the waist is quite tight, and by the end of the day I was ready to change out of it.  Material is nice - on the thicker side.  However, the back of the material is white, and when stretched over the bust (even with a dark bra) it looked like my bra was white.  I wore a jacket over it so ot was fine.  I have several other dresses by the same company that fit fine.  This one is snug on the top.",0
2,The quality was not good but did fit as expected. You definitely get what you pay for and if you don’t mind the quality these are for you. I do not recommend.,0
2,"La calidad es buena, pero es un corte de camiseta común.<br />No tiene el corte tipo túnica más amplio a la altura de la cadera y más larga atrás.",0
1,"The stones started coming out in 1 day, and it started turning black in 1 week. I Wouldn't recommend it.",0
5,Very comfortable love these sneakers...,1
2,Not enough room for DD's.,0
4,Live the size and can't wait to use it.,1
4,"I bought these to outfit my lanyards with a safety breakaway after a couple of close calls with a voracious robot. These do deliver. They don't breakaway as easily as I would prefer, but given that these are made for dog collars, it makes sense that they would take a little bit of tension before breaking away. It is much better than a lack of breakaways certainly.",1
2,I was really excited to get this but after wearing it for a few days it has turned my skin green and the metal is turning green and awful brown color! I would send it back if I could! I love the dangling butterfly/bee looking thing but not when I'm green at the top of my piercing and under my belly button!,0
5,Perfect my grandson loved it,1
5,"Most ear climber earrings I own end up with one or both of them falling down, hence are no longer ear climbers. These are adorable, small but not tiny, and stay in place perfectly. Love them.",1
1,This NOT SILK<br />WHY IS THIS POSTED AS SILK<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,0
3,I like the colors and design but not the actual material,0
5,stainless steel heavy mans ring for my religion is well under priced great deal great workmanship truly worth the value,1
5,It’s nicer than I expected. It’s not soft cloth. It’s on a plastic mask,1
5,"I really enjoy them. If you’re considering buying them, I would recommend.",1
5,"I have seen the reviews and every single one is justified...This is one of those items and Amazon that is not only quality but you will be so happy with the purchase  you will not be able to stop smiling... When the other customers said it fil like a &#34;GLOVE&#34; they were telling the truuuuuuth.... This is a great buy and I stand buy the product. Ladies you will not need to hesitate with this purchase, just choose the color..YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED !!!!!",1
5,These look really nice and sturdy and fit well on my wrist attached to a wristlet.,1
1,product way too small can't get a refund,0
2,it ok,0
3,It’s beautiful looking just like the photos in the listing.  After only 2 weeks of wearing it the finish has worn off and turns my skin green now.,0
5,Made my daughter happy was what she asked for,1
3,Started peeling,0
2,the unnatural material feels uncomfortable and makes me sweat...unlike  cotton pajamas...,0
1,Horrible is all I can say. Very milky diamonds!!!,0
1,I ordered a large hoping to cover some areas having twins. It was ver snug and the neck was tight as well. I returned it.,0
3,I was disappointed with the lenses being a film basically and not a thicker plastic. Feels like cartoonish.,0
3,"This item is listed as a comfy loose fit, it's not, it's a normal fit...which as it turns out for me was perfect and I love it.  I purchased another which was listed as a &#34;normal&#34; fit, but it was actually a comfy, loose fit which turned out to be way too large for me.  Could be someone mixed up the descriptions.  This is actually a 5 star product, the lack of another 2 stars is because the description did not match the fit.",0
2,This is a piece of trash and stopped working the first month I got it. I bought it for clinical because it could be easily wiped down with an alcohol swab. It served that purpose and quickly died with no revival.,0
2,It looked really cute in the picture but the material was really thin and it was really tight.Wasn't comfortable!,0
3,Didn’t keep shirts tucked in properly. Still areas where it untucked. I prefer the single connections vs the Y.,0
1,"I purchased the large size after measuring my calf at the widest point.  They fit fine and go on easy but have no more compression than a regular pair of socks.  They were useless.  I wanted sleeves rather than compression socks, because they tend to cut into my ankles.  These did nothing at all, so I'm returning them.  Maybe buying a smaller pair might work, but unfortunately after touching the material itself, it's obvious they won't give me the compression I need.",0
5,Great shirt washes well and if you have someone with issues with how fabrics feel try it.,1
4,Good quality and easy to carry,1
5,"I have ordered 4 of these, all different colors. They are beautiful and seem very well made. The eggplant is much more brown but it's still gorgeous!",1
5,I been using it and love it. Fits perfect. I do recommend it.,1
3,smaller than they looked,0
1,This is 100% polyester! Return.,0
3,"These fit me so strangely. They were skin-tight from the waist to the knees then were too long/wide at the bottom. I bought these to wear to a beach resort, and the fabric just felt too sweaty.",0
2,"It came sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise. However, it was nowhere near as roomy as pictured and arrived with four small holes. I decided to use it as a nightgown .",0
5,These are the coolest retros for my granddaughter! She loves them!,1
5,Very nice .,1
5,"The bracelet is perfect! I got it for my wife as a wedding day!<br />Real pearls, all the pearls are the same size, color and shape.<br />Very pretty Infinity Symbol with true 18K white gold.<br />Excellent Quality - Great Fit.<br />This bracelet goes with almost any outfit - adding an elegant touch!<br />I would defiantly Recommend to anyone",1
4,"Just a touch small for my liking, but incredibly soft. Great for around the house or running to the store.",1
3,They are ok but very small . They slip down in the pocket and cannot be seen.,0
3,"These were cute but they were too long for me. I'm 5'2 and have a short torso and I couldn't get them to fit quite right. I think if i could have removed the metal piece holding together the criss cross I could have got it to work. It is adjustable but not removable. Also, the clips don't grab on well. I was trying to wear it with a skirt that was a sort of slippery material so the clips would just slip off if they were pulled a little.",0
1,"I've worn this shirt a total of 4 times. Last night it ripped on me! Would really like a replacement as I loved this shirt, but have no way to contact the seller.",0
1,"No where near an XL, maybe an XS. Have other Spanx in XL that fit just fine.",0
1,This bra is far from high impact. Does not hold them in place. I should not be able pull straps 2 inches off my shoulders. I also bought the bra 2 sizes smaller than what i needed.,0
5,Fits the way I hoped for.,1
5,Always well made and perfect fit.,1
5,Grands Loved Them!,1
1,"I ordered size medium in the pants because that's my normal size (between size 6-8).  These pants were ridiculously small with a very short inseam.  The side pocket zipper was broken upon arrival.  I liked the stitching and detail but because of the short inseam, the knee stitching hit me in the wrong place.  These were really uncomfortable and cheap feeling.  Definitely not worth the time or effort of ordering.",0
3,I like how it is adjustable but don’t like how it get stuck on my clothing!,0
5,I love the no iron quality of the fabric. It came out of the dryer so soft!,1
3,Dont think would buy again cheap made but guess it's ok for a kid,0
3,"Product came on time, only 2 were the same, BUT the colored paint has been coming off my tongue ring in chunks...Probably won't order again, I DID like the included short gauge ruler included in the packaging though!",0
5,I love this outfit. Cute for date night or dress it up. It’s very comfortable. I bought a size and it fit perfectly.,1
5,Great shirt,1
3,They are adorable. But difficult to put in and stay in. The end is blunt and not pointed which made it difficult to put in easily.,0
4,"Linen is a terrific natural fiber, and is so very comfortable.  This shirt is well made and looks good.  Do be aware that linen isn't the perma-press synthetic fabrics many are used to.  As such, it wrinkles easily and needs a bit of extra care.  If you machine wash and dry it, you are going to either need to iron it or look a bit wrinkled.  Which you are going to look anyway after you wear it awhile.  Linen wrinkles.  I don't care.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this shirt is that it is a bit on the thin side.  This is probably not a problem in the colored shirts, but in the white one, it's a bit more see-through than I like.  Still, a very good looking and very comfortable shirt.",1
4,"I like the shirt. It's a little thin, you can see the color of your skin under it but no characteristics. It breathes really well and it looks like a nice shirt.",1
2,"This hat may be a &#34;slouchy&#34; for an infant. As for stylish, meh at best. However, for the price I can't complain too much. It's a plain run of the mill cap that unfortunately runs very small.",0
5,Love this!!  Nice and warm!!  Merry Christmas!!,1
1,It's broke in the for few hour I I wear it,0
1,"This would be perfect if the pearl was smaller.  It is so large, it makes the entire ring look cheap.  I will probably never wear it.",0
5,"Lots of choices and options, very colorful",1
1,Very cheap dress.,0
3,"The so-called &#34;snaps&#34; work on maybe 30% of the gloves - but for the price it doesn't matter to me.  I have large hands and the gloves fit snugly enough that the snaps really don't matter.  I'm in a veteran's color guard unit and the rifles tend to leave dark oily stains on the gloves that usually won't wash out - so maybe 2-3 uses and it's more economical to throw the gloves out than to wash them.  So, for the price, they work for me.",0
5,"This was perfect for our trip. It held cards, passport, and some cash but didn't take up a ton of space.",1
3,"It is a little bit bigger, must be made for babies with wider feet and ankles, my baby is just real petite",0
5,"I'm 5'1, 125lbs and the medium fit great. I will say the style is a bit revealing and it doesn't cover a whole lot, but it's super cute and comfortable. I love the tassels at the bottom and how lightweight it is. It's very flattering!",1
1,"I was shipped the wrong shoe! I ordered this pretty light pink one for a wedding we are going to and I got a raspberry color. The shoe I actually got is shown below. I know it’s an innocent error, but now I have to go through the return process. It’s just an annoying added step.",0
3,Love material and the look but runs to small,0
5,"This was so cute on our granddaughter,  she loves the material and of course the unicorn",1
5,This dress is very comfortable.  Is doesn't have any zippers and is a close fit but is very comfortable.  goes well with heels or boots.  Dresses up any occasion.,1
1,"Nice-size trifold wallet with a good amount of sleeves and compartments, however, the quality is horrid. The coin compartment started ripping after just two days of using this. I would not buy from this manufacturer again.<br /><br />Also (just for disclosure), the color is darker than it appears on the screen; it's a true mustard yellow, not a sunflower yellow.",0
4,Pants are a different fit but worked great for the halloween costume,1
2,"They aren't sized correctly. The pockets are too high and they don't cover the rear as advertised. I would return, but I washed and hung to dry them per the instructions. Disappointed.",0
5,Very solid earrings which make then pretty heavy. But definitely worth the money considering that they're not cheaply made,1
3,"The product is okay in terms of quality, but I was looking for a small understated earring that would be worn in a second hole. These are much, much larger than what I expected. So I can't really use them.",0
5,"This for the shirt of ""it's a good day to teach tiny humans"".<br /><br />A good, everyday t-shirt for to rep your homeschool love. This isn't cringy homeschool content and is cute enough to be an everyday wear. The 80% cotton, 20% Polyester has a good feel to it and the graphic details are on the material good and flex with the material. The size runs slightly large for what you're looking for and the sizing chart is accurate.",1
4,"It's okay, kind of cheap made, but expected for price. Overall good. For the price not much more to expect.",1
1,Very low quality material,0
3,"Beautiful color. However the lining on top and bottom is white and tends to roll out and be exposed. (You can see in other reviewers photos) Looks like it wasn’t properly sewn. Unfortunately, too late to return.",0
5,I love them!!,1
3,Dress runs a little big and the material is a little too thin,0
5,It is a nice looking watch! works well,1
5,Great!,1
5,it's super well made (not jean material more like a type of vinyl like idk) i love the strap and it was well packaged,1
2,"I'm very disappointed in this dress. Cheap material, Not made good, Doesn't fit right, The Split Is Overlapped way to much where it doesn't open when you walk.",0
1,"They all broke within a week of wearing them,  the whole stud broke off.",0
2,"For a little baggy.<br /><br />I’m 5’8”, 150 LB, and the Medium is too loose",0
1,wire bent first time I tried to insert in ear. Very cheaply made. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HQL7MSY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10,0
2,Arm fit tight very short in front runs a little small,0
5,"Very beautiful, arrived in a nice little drawstring bag & gift box. Received many compliments!<br />Great pair of earrings for the price!",1
4,Comfortable but light,1
1,"Won't print, melts.  Title says made from canvas - not even close!",0
5,"Drapes pretty, true to size, soft and flattering.",1
5,Fit as expected. Beautiful dress. Comfortable material. I received lots of compliments,1
5,Very good!,1
3,This was a low quality product. It's not horrible but it wont be good after you wear it a few times.,0
4,Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice mask and being able to upload photos is nice but the mask could be brighter. A lot of photos kinda don’t do well unless they are bright colors. The presets are solid. I tried all the settings and the one that is the most difficult would be the text because I’m the app you really have to format it so it sits evenly on your face. 3.5/5 but I’ll put it as 4 for now.,1
2,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. I thought it looked pretty cute and she’s a red head and you wouldn’t think it but she looks good in yellow. She is wearing 2t right now but the shirt was too snug. The shorts fit perfect which is what I was more concerned about. It doesn’t look flattering so probably won’t get much use out of this one, oh well. Just wanted to warn everyone you might want to get a bigger size then usual.",0
2,Two stones fell out now looks bad . Silver faded,0
5,"Bought this for our toddler, who has decided that Pete is her favorite character on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.  There doesn't seem to be a ton of Pete merchandise available, so we were glad to find this.  The shirt seems to be of good quality.  It had a slight smell (not bad, just weird) out of the package, but that resolved with washing.",1
1,Poor quality,0
2,"Looks pink in the picture, but they are actually lavender. I bought them to wear at my wedding with a pink theme, and they totally didn't match becauee they were a purple. Not happy with that. That was the only issue, false advertising of color.",0
1,Hate it! Runs small. H and (e)M has a way better made version. Lots of colors and very reasonable priced,0
3,It was cute my daughter loved it but it definitely fit more like a shirt then a dress. Still cute though!,0
5,"I needed a sun protection hat after a minor surgery on my face, strict sun protection ordered. This hat protected me from the sun as well as looking very cute!. Also did not wreck my hair! The chin strap is small enough to tuck back when it is not windy, but works well if a breeze threatens to make you lose the hat. Really happy with this.",1
1,"POOR QUALITY. Never wore, just washed once and there is a hole in the side!! One of the buttons fell off. It is super large in the chest area and small in the waist. I can’t even wear it with the hole that was produced with the FIRST WASHING. VERY disappointed and will be attempting to return. don’t waste you money on this one",0
4,"Was able to get the expected fit using the chart and description. They are very comfortable for my daughter to wear. The insoles inside stay in place, which was an issue for us with similar styled shoes. The material got a little worn around the toes, but no holes or anything that makes them unwearable. They held up at the beach and pool. Would definitely purchase again.",1
4,Its a beautiful bag and very sturdy but I couldn't give it 5 stars because its too small for me.,1
1,Please be aware that the color shown is not accurate. The description implies brown but it’s basically pink,0
5,Got here super quick & was impressed by the material! Soft and sophisticated. Fit great on me (M) and I styled it to tie the bow in the back instead of in the front.,1
3,not great .<br />but for this price ok!,0
5,"good product, great price!",1
5,"My 7 year old bought this because she fell in love with it ... I am so glad she wasn’t disappointed when it showed up. It looks identical to the picture. The price was beyond amazing, I don’t know how they made it and shipped it for $2.00! Go for the black one it definitely looks the best.",1
1,The center part of one of the studs popped out and I did not notice until later in the day. Therefore I do not know where it happened.<br />Needless to say I was not happy.<br />I guess this speaks for the quality of this product.,0
5,"My daughter loved the earrings!  Somehow they got lost in shipping, but the company was very quick to replace them and honor the order.  For the price they were perfect for a tween.  Not too big or heavy.  I will definitely order from them again.",1
4,cute,1
5,The delivery was a pain.The earrings are gorgeous and so beautiful and comfortable.if u have sensitive skin u must get these,1
1,Loved it but broke the second time I wore it. Wouldn’t recommend,0
5,"This is great. Super cute and a nice present to myself, a new puppy mom.",1
4,My daughter uses them every day for school. Laces come loose to often. I had to buy no-lace shoes but otherwise very comfy and stylish. Thanks!,1
4,"Wow, this dress was super cute!  I ordered the XS, I am 115 pounds and 5'1&#34; - it fit perfectly!  It hits right above my knees.  It's very classy yet sexy!  A keeper! Well made as well.",1
4,I think it was used or beat up. I m still happy,1
4,Get ready to hem.  I am 5'6&#34;and I hemmed 3 inches and still wore high heels.  Can be fancy or laying around the house.  So comfy.,1
5,Love it ! This little purse is adorable. Perfect for all of my essentials !,1
5,Very cute. Nice quality.,1
5,Washes well and fits well,1
3,"VERY hard to click open!! It takes me at least 3 times of pushing it up (I have weak hands and they get tired from the hard pushing) and finally got it! I left it open, thinking it might make it easier, but again, another 3-4 hard pushes to get it to finally click to stay open! Hoping it changes with time and more use! Material seems cheap and more plastic like than cloth.",0
5,Very comfortable fitting,1
3,"I actually really loved these!! They were super cute once I pulled them out, had lovely packaging, but my legs are on the thicker side so pulling them up over my knees and getting them to stay was a no-no! They work as mid-rise socks for me but I do wish they were a bit bigger in size!",0
5,Great,1
3,"I'm a pretty standard medium (5'2"" 34A/B)  and this was way too big.  Too bad as it was very warm and soft!  Rather than deal with the hassle of returning, I'll add it to my donation box.",0
1,The black parts faded in the armpits area after 2 wears and no washing as of yet 🤦🏻‍♀️,0
1,It’s not a miracle worker. Very thin and flimsy.,0
2,"Sometimes I ignore reviews, but they were right about this one.  Kinda cheap, and way over priced for the quality.  I'm not that picky either; sooooo I wouldn't get this one if I were you, when you can buy the same thing at Wal-Mart for $5. less.",0
1,"El vestido que me enviaron no es el que yo compré, es un modelo diferente (manga al codo, no tiene hombro frío y el ruedo es irregular. Nunca lo hubiera comprado.",0
2,Broke after a week,0
2,returned the top was way to big.  bottom was ok.  Material was thin.,0
2,Fits cute but this isn’t beige. Haven’t decided if I’ll return it just yet.,0
3,Nice earings took forever to get but worth the wait,0
1,"I gave it 1 star simply because I can't give it any lower..... I did  not like the look the feel( it felt like it would fall apart) , I only liked one thing about it, the ease of return",0
1,For weeding...but it's not the way the commercial said it will do. No good plus the claws is just came off so easy.,0
5,"Soft yoga style pants with pockets! Love them. I'm 5'6 & 170#, size 12/14 pants. I think after a wash they will fit perfectly. They were a tad loose by the end of the day, however there are belt loops. I ordered an l/XL size. I will be ordering another pair!",1
3,"I am tall and heavy set and this shirt just isn't flattering at all.  For some reason it hangs wrong.  I thought I was going to really like it and maybe a shorter waist girl that is smaller might fit into it better.  I am 5'8"" tall.",0
5,Perfect tutu for my daughter's costume. It arrived on time and appears well made as it withstood playground days!,1
2,To small,0
5,"I've had these gloves for about 2 weeks and they are great! My gloves do not slip over the steering wheel while driving which I've always been worried about with other gloves. The touchscreen portion on the pointer finger and thumb also seems to work just fine and is extremely convenient.  I (think) I have bigger hands than the average lady and although they were slightly tight when I first started wearing them, the leather has stretched a bit and they now fit great as they've conformed to my hands which is exactly what I wanted.",1
5,Beautiful and heavy.,1
4,The color is not light purple it’s more grey. I will still use. Maybe it’s my eyes playing tricks and the image on Amazon is actually grey and not purple. It’s a great size!,1
5,Exactly what I was looking for. It's not too thin but not too thick. Nice smooth material. Fit wasn't too snug but wasn't baggy either. An excellent buy.,1
4,"Cute! Daddy loved it! Average quality, fit as expected.",1
5,This top fits well and is very comfortable.,1
5,Well made!! Very flattering!,1
2,I have barely had the necklace six months and it broke while I was putting it on. Bart even worn it due to looking for a charm to go on it and finally I had found one I loved and then it broke.,0
5,"Nice material, good fit, love the pockets.  I question the care instructions,  ""professional dry clean recommended "". Who dry cleans pajamas? I washed them delicate cold, hung to dry. The pajamas came out fine. I'm a woman with hips, so I ordered XL. Draw strings are just for show, elastic waist band is fine though.",1
5,Who wouldn’t love these cute pigs in galoshes?,1
5,So much fun! Fits true to size.,1
1,"So, I wasted $20!  They are pretty much worthless, fall off way too easy.  I read other people's negative posts, stating the same, I thought, well they must be doing something wrong - but they are legit, these just don't work nearly as well as the other stick-on lenses that use hot water to attach to the lens.  I'm sorry for the negative review, but they just are not nearly as good as claimed.  Listen, I had a brand new pair of sunglasses - and the brand new lenses, so both surfaces were new and clean!  And they still just would pop off very easily.  Yes, I did try flipping the lens, but still it would pop off.  I was really hoping these would work as advertised, as I wanted to keep them as ""portable"" to use between my several pairs of sunglasses, and not have to boil a pot of hot water.  But, these just don't measure up to their promise.  I hope you save your money, or, I hope you have better luck, but I really sincerely doubt you will.  I hope I've helped.  :-)",0
5,Got these for my eight year old grandson and he really likes them.,1
2,It's completely see through. You'll need to buy a slip to be able to wear this.,0
5,"This is a great locket. I bought two, one in gold and one in silver. You can get a bunch of charms in one. I bought sets of 10 charms for each and didn't have any trouble getting them all in. Now, at least half of the charms were little birthstones, so I can't say that 10 regular charms would fit, especially some that are bigger, but this is a spacious locket.<br />I have seen the lockets from Origami Owl, and these are comparable, the same size altho oval.<br />The chains are lovely. The Ball Station Chain is my favorite, but the Bamboo is pretty too.<br />I got the charms here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J0SPO1I/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 from Hot Buy King. It was a great deal, an inexpensive way to fill up this wonderful locket.<br />I will update my review if I find issues with this item.",1
5,"Love it, well made, fits perfectly",1
1,"They said they run small so I went a size up and really you need to go two sizes up if you have any kind of hips. The button hole also is sewn up; so even if they did fit, I wouldn’t be able to button them. Super sad because they look super cute",0
4,The jacket and color were gorgeous! Unfortunately it just ran way too big. I wish an xs had been offered. I ended up selling it to a friend who it fits perfectly!,1
5,"very nice, I just have to do some adjustments.",1
1,It’s too bad this bracelet doesn’t look like the photo. The champagne stone (peachy orange) bracelet only comes in ROSE gold and not yellow gold (as pictured). IRL it’s peach overkill (to me) and the yellow gold suits it better. I’m so disappointed because I really wanted this item.,0
5,"It does the job, I'm comfortable with it",1
5,They are fabulous 💕,1
1,The material was stretched . Awful threw it out!,0
1,"This is a cute and perfect size purse for me, but dang!! the light color was almost as bright as the sun!! I know, it said light, but didn't say bright-like-the-sun light.... So, I returned it and got a red one - darker color so I can't see everything that scratched it nor attached itself to it. Downsizing is good, but let's not advertise it...",0
2,I was not happy with fit but I kept the dress.,0
1,"This product is an outright lie. The title says engraved and the picture clearly shows an engraved product, but what I received is just printed on. I have no faith that it won't be scratched off immediately. The big sis keychain also broke immediately. Not worth the money.",0
2,"I was so excited to find this style, was just what I was looking for. Unfortunately they didn’t last long before the chain broke off if one of the earrings. Insert sad face.",0
1,"This took over a month to get, too small and I'm normally a small.<br />Return is not free, and not worth the $ or Hassel. Don't order",0
1,I had them in my lip for two days and they started to hurt my lip so bad I had to cut the top off,0
5,"I love these, came early. I will be buying alot more of these kind of earrings. Droplet Earrings.",1
1,Cheaply made. Fabric needs a liner!,0
1,Looked good. Several nice comments when warn. Emblem fell off the third time I wore it.,0
5,Say goodbye to leg pain..these are awesome!!!,1
5,AHHH!!! PERFECT!!!,1
5,"Great little hat- My son is barely 1, but I bought a size 2-4T for him to grow into it & am thankful I did!! The head has an adjustable elastic band to help it fit his head, with plenty of room to grow.",1
3,The item feels ultra flimsy like a super cheap scarf.  Even for a light cover up it is way too flimsy.  I suppose that given the price I should have expected as much.  You get what you pay for here.  It is a beautiful pattern but I'll be lucky to get a couple of uses out of it.,0
3,the elastic waistband is too tight and uncomfortable,0
1,"I received the band two days ago. It doesn’t have the most secure hold of my tracker. Yesterday it popped out onto the kitchen floor. I figured if it happened once it’s not a big deal. I may have had it not in fully or whatever. Since then I’ve kept a closer eye on if the tracker is still seated in the band. Tonight as I was leaving work, it popped out again. I didn’t notice until I was already halfway home. Went back after dinner, and there was the tracker. Sitting on the pavement. Scraped up. Screen damaged. I’m going back to the original band that the gotcha came with.",0
4,"I bought this for myself for those days that are really rough. It reminds me that I need to just ""Keep going"" no matter what...<br />It had to be adjusted some, which is kind of hard because it's stainless steel, but it can be done.<br />The only Con - is that the black comes off the design if you wear it all the time. (The first ring I bought like this didn't do that but it's also not for sale anymore, so I got this one).<br />I still like it and would buy again, if I lose it, like I did the first one...",1
4,Cute heart necklace,1
4,This could be casual or you could dress it up. Shrunk a little in the wash but I would recommend you size up to get the off the shoulder look. I plan on getting more in different colors.,1
1,"Where do I start without getting more upset .1. This gold material is totally of the lowest quality. I received my package tried it one only to be covered in gold dust( pray to god I'm not allergic to this dust cause hello I smell a law suit around the corner "" as if I'm wearing makeup on my body the gold if rubbing off the bodysuit as I try on . 2. The fit of the suit I gave a 6 out of ten I had to let my Tailor run a stich to the lower back because it was literally floating away from my body ""it's as if I'm suppose to have lower back fat😒"". I am a 6"" 3 inches slim built guy and doesnt fit properly...tailoring poor. The zipper could of been hidden.<br /><br />Of all the flaws I must say the  length was great hence the one star",0
5,Fantastic,1
5,Stay on all night and super cute,1
5,They are perfect,1
1,"As far as cheap jewelry goes, this looks incredibly cheap.",0
5,"Can't beat the value in this bag for the price.  I was hesitant to purchase when I saw the review about the hangar not being sewn in and held only by Velcro, but now am glad because that review was incorrect - mine is sewn and the Velcro only serves to keep it out of the way of the zipper.",1
3,"Pretty decent top but have to wear something over the top as the armholes are cut out too far in the front.  Even wearing a strapless bra, you see the sides of the bra.",0
5,24 bands for $8. Others charge a lot more for less.,1
5,Pretty,1
3,Too small and didn't like the fabric.,0
4,"I was really excited to get this ring because it was supposed to flow in the dark. It didn't arrive in the cool little bags my other qalo rings did and it does not glow in the dark. It's comfortable enough, but I'm over all disappointed.",1
5,"Arrived two days after purchased! Great product and packaging, I messed up the wax the first time and had to throw it out but that was my error so I used the wax for the top set since I wasn't going to use them so far so good. Might have to re mold them soon to wrap around my bottom teeth more",1
5,Beautiful dress exactly as discripted,1
2,Wasn't sewn straight and came with a broken strap,0
4,"I usually wear small in shirts, but I got a medium after reading the reviews. I ended up exchanging it for a large, which I feel was the best fit. It's very clingy, but I do like it.",1
5,"Son loves it, he uses it  for concrete work",1
4,I like these sNdaks. But would like fewer straps.,1
2,Colors are not as shown 👎👎,0
3,I love the price but not the quality of product,0
5,Pretty cool n creepy. I'll probably purchase more.,1
5,"It's a perfect fit for my eyeglasses.  I love the color, goes perfect with my purse!",1
2,Not made for women with hips,0
4,"I felt the zipper dressed it down too much for work so I returned it. Other than the zipper i really liked it, it fit nicely and the material was rather thick.",1
5,Muy bonito,1
5,I wore this set for trick-or-treat for 2 hours outside with my kids on a chilly Oct night. I wasn’t cold! They fit great and are very soft!,1
1,Sits weird in all the wrong places. It's a gamble buying clothes from Amazon now.,0
1,It broke the first time I used it and it would not fit back in the case,0
3,I like these socks and wear them a lot but I have 2 complaints. 1.  The threads are coming out since the first washing. 2.  The seem across the toe is so bulky that it can be very uncomfortable if the sock shifts around on your foot.,0
5,"Purchased from Worldofhandbags, didn't come w/Prime so paid for shipping; $89. Great price and cute bag. Was searching for a non-leather bag and found this. Debated whether to get the larger size but thought it a bit too large and like this &#34;small&#34; better. Very helpful to have measurements and photo of women wearing bag, inside photos...etc. to get a feel of the look and true dimensions. The front plate has gold trim and the sholder strap has gold claps/buckle. Great buy! My two Photos: I put my ipad inside so you could see it fits (has a pink cover). Inside has 2 zipper compartments; one in the middle, one is inside back and 2 small pockets. Don't think I'll even use the &#34;dogleash&#34; center closure.",1
5,Bought this for my &#34;Cowboy-Lovin'&#34; hubby and son! Fits as expected and good quality for the price.,1
4,"The package contains five different pattern masks; Darth Vader x2, stormtrooper, flame trooper (I assume) & Bobba Fett.<br /><br />They're made out of a silky material with an internal pocket to fit a removable filter pad. They also feature adjustable ear loops.<br /><br />-- x --<br /><br />I'm not sure what I expected. They are good but I question how effective they are as a face mask.<br /><br />They're cold to wear and the filter pad seems a little redundant. Surely if you inhale, you draw the air in from all sides and not just directly in front of your nose. It might be a different story if there was some sort of air valve like an N95.<br /><br />One possibility I'm considering is buying a different cloth mask to wear underneath. It could both replace the filter pad and provide a bit more comfort.<br /><br />I also wish there was more variety in the designs. That said, if the choices are limited to Star Wars & iconic face gear, there isn't much to choose from. Hero's in movies need to be easily identifiable so they don't wear face coverings... Although a Tuskan Raider would be doable.<br /><br />Guess they couldn't go too far down that track. I'd assume they have to pay a royalty to Disney for every likeness they print.",1
1,Weird flap of material off of the slit. Major return issues. Still haven't gotten a return label over a week later. Offered to give me refund of 50$ and keep the dress. Paid over a 100. I want my money not your ill fitting dress.,0
2,"It’s a nice idea with the Lightning bolts but after one wear, it pilled ..I can’t wear it again",0
3,It’s pretty tough all around except for the clip mine broke the same day I got it so don’t buy it just because of the money clip,0
5,This is exactly what I needed. Simple and easy to use. Well constructed.,1
5,These are very cute and well made.,1
2,"Not in love with this. Sized up based on the reviews but it was kind of frumpy and the sleeves were too short. Even in a smaller size, the front ruffles hung funny.",0
5,Love the color,1
3,"This is a decently made piece of jewelry that hangs nicely. The chain and pendant were a little shorter and slightly smaller than expected, but not outrageously so. I was a bit disappointed with the pendant because the black contrast was not nearly as heavy as the advertisement suggests. The overall product felt, off, like it was leftover from a decades-old stash found at the bottom of a shipping crate, or even a different item altogether. But once you hit it with some black permanent marker in the indented areas, it adds enough contrast to make it look a little closer to their advertised pictures, though you can still tell that they likely photoshopped their product pictures. I'm not exactly happy with the necklace and pendant because I feel it is yet another deceptive product, but at least you can do something to make it look a bit better. The execution of the pendant may seem off, but the foundation/the materials themselves are as expected. It is an okay value for what you get once you add some contrast. Luckily the recipient liked it, which was its saving grace.",0
4,"I ordered this apron with my logo on it for food demos and it came out great. I have not washed it yet so don't know how it will come out, but so far the apron is what I expected from the description and delivered on time.",1
5,Nice sneaker,1
3,It really is meant for tiny waisted people. But I wear it high up on dresses with empire waists so it does work because of how stretchy it is.,0
1,"Wore them once, they split along the waistband. Severely. I'm very thin, these things just fell apart as soon as I put them on.",0
5,Cleaned my shoes and were left like new,1
5,very nice!,1
5,Love it! I looks so beautiful!,1
1,"I received a completely different tunic all together, I ordered a grey xl long sleeve and I received a white xxxl short sleeve ! get it together !",0
3,"The chain turned blackish gross only after wearing a couple of times. I never showered with it on or to sleep. The pendant still looks good, but I will be replacing the chain. I would not buy this item again unless it was gold filled.",0
5,Love it very nice. Just bought me a nice dress to<br />wear this piece with.,1
1,The material is very light.,0
1,It was ridiculously large and seemed like a party favor given out during birthday parties,0
3,"[[VIDEOID:5d67734a0a76bd617e6abe819e1dcb6e]] Very neat little trinkets, when Florida let us down in the souvenir department these filled in the gap. They are unique & will be well received, however, shipping left a lot to be desired. They were sent in a gallon size ziplock with jaws interlocked - no padding. The combination of this caused a few teeth to be knocked loose & out. There’s no time for replacements so it’s what it is.",0
5,Nice purse!,1
5,"It is exactly as pictured and as described. Good quality, well made.<br />This product arrived on time, as expected. It was shipped in sturdy packaging. I was so excited to receive it! I had been searching to find the highest quality, so I was pleasantly surprised to receive an offer to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I consider myself very lucky because I love this product. The discount in no way influences my rating or comments. All it really does is encourage me to post my comments. Would I recommend this to a friend? YES. I would have purchased it at full price. I highly recommend it.",1
5,"This was very nice tshirt! Mid/heavy weight cotton that drapes really nice! No clinging , nice longer length that covers hips.",1
3,"Very pretty, but poorly made and looks like a one or two time wearing item before it breaks or color wears off.",0
3,It looks exactly like the picture and it is well made. The only downside for me is that the arm holes were a bit too snug for me. Everywhere else fits as expected. It'll be a great work outfit and everyday dress but I don't think I'll order another.,0
5,VERY COMFORTABLE CRUISE WEAR.,1
5,Good quality and stylish 👍,1
3,"I really like this robe. But the zipper is separating at the bottom. I was trying to contact the company but to get help but couldn’t get a hold of them. I want the same thing, hoping it’s just defective. I really like the style. I’m hoping they read the review and contact me.",0
5,Fit very comfortably.,1
4,Two words.<br /><br />Kenshin Himura.,1
1,The fabric felt and looked terrible.,0
4,Would rather have a cotton top,1
2,not even close to proper sizing,0
1,Received the necklace and no bracelet!,0
5,"Cute purse...it's actually more spacious than it looks in my opinion. I used it on vacation and it could fit 2 cell phones, a small hand lotion tube, lip gloss, ID,debit and credit card, cash, a pack of tissues and a pair of sunglasses",1
4,Cute,1
3,A bit tight getting over my head and a bit hard staying on as a mask during Covid-19.,0
5,"Love love love this tee shirt!!! The material is amazing, thick and soft!! I ordered a small (I'm 5'5 115 pounds and small chested). It's a little to tight for me personally, if you like your clothes to be a bit loose, order a size up. I plan to when I buy more from them!!",1
3,there's okay,0
4,Okay for masks...  not my favorite but they work,1
2,Pretty but doesn’t stay on shoes clasp too short so they keep falling off quite a challenge not losing them,0
5,Perfect size my son moves them good for the cold weather,1
3,"Too big for me.  Did not work with my sunglasses, which was the whole reason I bought it.  Maybe I have an unusually small head.  I loved the look of it and the design, but it didn't work for me.  I've returned it for a refund.",0
2,"For an inexpensive brand, the styling, materials, and workmanship are good. But the boots are ar least 3/4 if not a full size too small. I always wear a ten and even if some brands or styles do not fit right, they are never this snug. And to make it worse, I emailed the company RIGHT after Christmas to request a return label and still have not heard back, almost 3 weeks later!",0
1,Doesn't fit my daughter I send back and they never give my money back it's over month,0
5,Great.,1
2,Too short.,0
2,"Unfortunately, these boots do not come up to the standard of the UGG brand. For one, the fit is very different. Specifically, the ankle and calf are much too snug, especially for wearing leggings inside. Stick with the Classic Tall version.",0
5,I love it!,1
5,Love this long shirt,1
5,second shirt purchased from friendly oak super soft and comfy.,1
5,Thank you very nice,1
4,I had to return it because it was to big. Read the reviews and they said it ran small to order the larger size. Well for me it didn't I have to reorder the small. It was really nice just hope the smaller size will fit.,1
1,Does not fit in any way. It’s like the top was sewn for a 300 lb person and the bottom half sewn for a 75 lb person.,0
5,cool,1
2,"It fits well, looked good.  Notice the past tense? It has been up for 2-1/2 weeks and it’s already faded.  Too bad. so sad.  Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.",0
3,"it shed white fuzzies all over, it was okay for a one time use.",0
5,Works as advertised.,1
3,"They’re not the best, but I do like them. The paint is a little cheapy, mine came with a scratch on it, but it was small. The paint is also only on one side so they only look good from the front. They’re lightweight which is nice and I wore them for a couple hours without getting an allergic reaction so they’re POSSIBLY nickel free (that’s what I react to). They’re a little bit bigger than a quarter of you were wondering about size. I ended up taking the metal bar thing off of them to make them dangle a little less, which worked, so they’re easy to work around with things you don’t like.<br />Overall, I’d say it’s pretty okay for your money. Maybe I’d spend a little less, idk.",0
5,Great,1
5,"It’s super higher quality, I really like like it and recommend it",1
4,Gorgeous lace dress.,1
4,The arm length was just a tad off. the arms came to my wrist so I had to keep pulling the arms down to cover my wrist but other than it fit perfectly.,1
4,So cute,1
1,Too tight for a normal large size.,0
5,Very comfortably been worn.,1
1,"I'm so very disappointed in these earrings, I just had to share. Not only did they come all bent up out of shape (I was easily able to bend it back though, which might tell you something how long these will last), the backs that the send with them don't even fit on the earrings!  Unbelievable!",0
5,"This skirt is legendary, I’m 5’5 and 138lbs, and reading the reviews I thought the normal size I always get which is medium is going to be small for me, but it was not! It was stretchy and true to size. I receieved a lot of compliments. The obly problem is the quality of the zipper, it sometimes slides down the zip, so you have to pay attention to it. It would have been great if it stayed secure in place but it’s so beautiful it would not bother me honestly.",1
3,It fit a little small  for the size that I ordered.  I would recommend getting a size larger than usual.,0
1,"This suit is so small, I am petite 4'9&#34; and less than 100lbs and I couldn't get this thing on! I do have a large chest but there was NO give to this suit to get it on. I am returning for this reason, it looks just like the picture and is cute but be aware this runs really small!",0
2,"The belt itself is cute. It came packaged well and on time. But, the hooks in the front do not match up properly so it can just pop off at anytime. Which lets just say is very embarrassing when your in front of people working and your belt just pops right off for no reason. Wish it could of worked out.",0
3,I love the style and it runs a tag large but the material doesn't hold up. It has faded some. Love the length though. If you or anyone in your family has long hair it sticks to this material.,0
3,It did not come with the pencil case or lunch box.,0
2,"This product looks cheap, and it tangles so easily its near impossible to get onto your head. Its a waste of money. For the price it might be a fun add on to a Halloween or a Renaissance costume.",0
5,I love the flip flop socks.  They fit all each foot.,1
3,"Broken, loved the look of it, but the clasp broke, just popped off!",0
1,These are not warm nor comfy! Air blows right through the thin material and does not provide any warmth at all. They are not comfy and are actually pretty stiff and rough. I do not recommend these at all and wish I never would have wasted my money on them.,0
1,I bought this for my boyfriend as an Xmas present. After the third day using it (only his laptop and charger) one of the zippers broke...very frustrating.,0
2,"Good quality belt,locks the pubes in it sometimes though😬😵,hardware leaves a bit much to be desired.Buckle snags on stuff and pops open.Needs a clasp to keep it locked.It snaps in place,but it pops apart easy.",0
4,"I ordered a size bigger. I wish I had ordered a smaller size. I admit they fit okay  but not as expected. The material is soft, pockets are  great. I liked the quality of the pants. I kept these, and also ordered a small pair.",1
1,"I'm very curvy and have a true hour glass body shape. The bra looks great in the morning but about an hour later it starts creeping up to the point that it feels like me girls are up to my throat. I'm a c cup, 34in around and I feel so constricted by these bras. I ordered a size 36 thinking I probably bought it to small but now I have to pull it down constantly that I end up with bruising and friction burns. I want to believe these type of bra is not for gals with my body shape.",0
5,"Love, Love, Love",1
1,"The worst at least not for working on cars I give it the worst review possible they are not flexible , they do not stretch and they brake as soon as it contacts any surface .. I mean it !",0
5,I am a maintenance worker and I needed something that would keep me warm when outdoors but comfortable enough to be able to move freely and this was perfect.,1
5,Beautiful dress color pink so cute and comfortable thanks!!,1
1,My daughter(3 years) and I were looking at panties and she chose this set because she loves watermelons and carrots and thought they were so cute. I just ordered and didn’t think I would have to review the words on them. Who in the WORLD writes “enjoy myself” with those creepy little faces the carrots are making on toddler panties?! So sick and inappropriate. They were promptly thrown away.,0
5,"All in all, it's a nice product... the only thing I'm complaining about is the zipper. It's a bit bulky and not the best, so it doesn't always zip up the best or easily. Other than that, I enjoy it!",1
3,"The shirt is of good quality, but the size is about two sizes less than indicated on the tag.  It isn't worth the hassle dealing with companies overseas to try and get a refund, so I gave it to my brother who is two sizes smaller than my boyfriend.",0
2,Couple of them are on so tight I can't get the ball off.,0
1,One of the earring broke disappointed..will try and send back.,0
5,I love them,1
5,My 9 yr old daughter loves these shoes!!!!...she gets so many compliments on them. They're different an cute.,1
5,I absolutely LOVE how CUTE these are!!,1
1,get a popcicle stick; it will do the same job.,0
5,"My fiancee and I are very excited about the Ring, very good purchase",1
1,Car will not start with the cover on...,0
4,"The size chart is accurate. I  normally  wear a 'large' flannel shirt, but after washing and drying they are often tight across the chest.  I ordered this shirt Extra Large and it fits well before washing. I also noticed that there is a bit of a taper in the body. If the wearer has a bit of a belly there would be a problem.  The material is light weight, I will be wearing a sweater under it, even indoors.",1
3,"Thhis whole line -- or everything I ordered -- is de[icted with some length and a resulting graceful appearance. In fact they are short, skimpy, boxy, and just not the same thing at all.",0
4,Runs smaller than expected!!!,1
5,she loves it.,1
4,order a size up,1
5,"Had to take similar jacket back after Christmas to LOCAL store.  My husband did not like color or fabric.  We were excited to find just what he wanted online as there weren't any in the local area, and it fit perfect and was great.  It even arrived earlier that was indicated.",1
3,"While this is a good product/ invention, I find that it is not thick enough and eventually cracks and becomes unbearable.",0
5,Boyfriend loves NBC,1
4,I actually really like this sweater like top a lot. It's kind of odd until I have it on for a while because it's a bit big through the &#34;shoulders&#34;& I'm little wider than most ladies. So it's an odd feeling. It's lined though and it's comfy!,1
3,The pockets are slightly uneven...debating if I keep it or not. It was cheap so I didnt have high hopes. Looks like like you could through it in the sun.,0
4,"Runs a little small.  I had to return the first one I ordered and get a bigger size, but it is very flattering and I really enjoy wearing it.",1
4,Love these. After having many different more expensive ones when I was in the military these have done the job just fine. I have even on accident dropped in the river of the boat with the wife expensive camera. She was not pleased but it floated and no leaks and everything was protected.,1
4,Lo recomiendo es de buena duración y hermoso,1
5,Cute bag and color!,1
5,Lindísimo como ajusta al cuerpo,1
5,LOVE IT,1

2,"Good product. Stitching is good, design is good. Overall pleasing to the eye......<br />Size not so much. I'm a big guy and wear a 4x so I figured a 5x would be roomy....nope. the 5x fits like a 3x.",0
1,"It was very low quality, wayy to big, and not worth the price at all. I was very disappointed",0
5,"I am  5' 0'', 130 pounds, 38B, ordinary build. The Medium fit perfectly on me. It is just the right length for tucking into jeans without bunching or bulging and it stays tucked. I also like wearing this style because it inspires me to lift weights everyday. The material is light and silky-feeling without being see-through (I got the black, gray and brown pack). It covers my racer back bra completely. I also like wearing them as pajama tops, as they are comfortable to sleep in. My experience has been very positive, so I would definitely recommend.",1
2,I have bought a 4 pack in the past and they were perfect. This 4 pack however was made wrong. The straps were sewed on backwards. Which makes it super awkward to wear and not mention it is super itchy bc the the straps are poorly made. I'm really disappointed bc the first set I got I love.,0
5,"Love it! It definitely does run small so get it in one size bigger. I bought the small it's a perfect fit! I'm normally an xs. I'm petite, 5'2&#34; and I weigh around 100 lbs. I purchased this item for the bottom because I don't like wearing bikini bottoms; I prefer full coverage.",1
4,"Shirt is super soft and a little bit thicker, like a thin sweatshirt.  It fits me perfectly, but I sized up because I was going for a flowy look like the model..I guess size up 2 or 3x to get the oversize look",1
3,"Decent boots, but are WAY smaller than they state.",0
1,Looks pretty but it caught and snags everything!  The bracelet got snagged on my shirt which is now ruined.  The necklace snagged on my sweater.  So which I had never gotten this.  Hate ruining one of my favorite outfits!,0
4,I like it very week in fact I love it,1
1,This watch was so boring it didn't even have any glow to tell time in the dark!!! Piece of 💩 I returned it!!! Nuff said!!!,0
3,wrinkles a lot! pulled out of dryer full of wrinkles.  Not as pretty as I thought it would be,0
1,WAY too small. I am about a L/XL regularly and I easily wouldve needed a 5X just to fit into this!! it barely fit my roommate who is usually a S!,0
5,Love this hat limited edition my husband will enjoy this for his birthday,1
5,👍👍👍,1
3,"I was so so excited to get these leggings, it seemed like everyone was raving about them. When I received my pair today I immediately tried them on and they were too big! This wouldn’t sound frustrating but after reading through so many reviews and following the sizing chart I was debating between S and M. I’m 5’3” 130 lbs and ultimately went with small despite the size chart telling me to go with medium. I know these have potential to be 5 star leggings but the fit is just way too off for me. Maybe I’ll try an x-small",0
4,Nice quality. This is a thinner material than most hoodies. The sizes are listed in EU sizes. I ordered a Large and received a US Medium/EU Large. Had to exchange for the size listed as XL which is actually a US Large. Size up on this one.,1
1,"I was so excited when these arrived. Very cute and they felt really heavy and solid. Unfortunately, after about a month and a half of light use 3 of the 4 have had some kind of issue. The chain on the sea star, used about twice per day on my purse, broke. My 2 year old brought me the large jewel that the dolphin is supposed to be holding. I don't know how she got it loose. Thank goodness she didn't put it in her mouth. A jewel is already missing from the crab. The dolphin, crab and octopus were on the diaper bag, which also gets pretty light use. The Octopus seems to be holding up so far but I don't have high hopes for it.",0
2,To small and they deliver wrong color . the picture look white but it came cream,0
5,What a great deal for a pair of sunglasses. I love them and they are super cute. They do keep the sun out ur eyes.,1
5,Loved it,1
2,"Did not like the material. It was too light and clingy. 5'10&#34; size 14, and it fell above the ankle. I returned it.",0
5,Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Good value for money.,1
5,Thank you so much for your willingness to work with us. This was a good product.,1
5,Thank you,1
5,Good,1
5,"Great quality, absolutely love this purchase",1
5,The box we ordered is beautiful.,1
5,Loved the size and quality of the material. I bought this for Halloween.,1
1,The zipper refused to work so and it smells so strongly of harsh chemicals.,0
5,"Very lovely, my friend said looks like the original one. Adjustable.",1
1,shirk when washed in cold water,0
5,Item is cute but waaaaaay smaller than I expected. Very dainty,1
2,Very tiny!,0
5,Sweet shirt very comfortable,1
1,Band cracked and broke,0
1,I Love the blouse...it just didn't fit. I ordered a 3x and it fit more like an XL.,0
1,They stop working 3 day after we got them,0
5,bought for grandson and he loved them.,1
3,"The bag worked very well. No water got into my phone and I had it submerged under water for a while when I was at Discovery Cove swimming. The touch screen does not work while under water, but above water it works fine. The only thing that is difficult is using the side buttons, but that is the only downside. Other than that this product did exactly what I needed and I will continue to use it!",0
3,"Returned it. For the price, it's alright, but it felt cheaply made to me. I decided to save my money and wait to invest in something higher quality.",0
1,Too small and a button was missing and one had fallen off in the bag,0
5,"Exactly as expected. Great fabric, moves easily, easy to put on.",1
5,Ordered this for unicorn day at the library. Super cute and soft. Fits great.,1
5,This was a gift and the recipient loved it. She wears it during games. The leather seems to be holding up.,1
4,These socks are comfortable and reasonably priced.  I kept two pair and gifted three!,1
4,"Bought this for my son. He is 5’ 10” 135lb. He is usually a medium, but we ordered a large because he wanted it to be a little baggy. The large ended up being what we normally would find in a medium fit. The material is a little thinner than I would expect a sweatshirt to be, but maybe that’s what “athletic” style means. Soft and strong material nonetheless. The color is a vibrant red orange. Will be good for fall, but maybe not winter.",1
1,There is nothing Skinny about these jeans.<br />I could get two legs In each leg hole.,0
5,The wife loves these ethnic themed ear accessory rings. Real wood.,1
5,"I got this for my gorgeous boyfriend for Christmas. For people that are outdoors and looking to reduce sun impact, this was a great deal.",1
1,The color stands out but  rubbish fake not as advertised<br />Very disappointed should  get  my  money back,0
5,"Usually the padding is the first thing I remove, but this bra keep the pads in place so I don’t feel like I need to. Supportive and comfortable. Definitely recommend.",1
5,I LOVE THESE SOCKS AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT!,1
2,"2 holes on the back are oddly placed, and weird. It's pretty long. Wasn't my best purchase, but it's ok.",0
3,They should have in between sizes.,0
3,"I love the Magnesium wash, which is a medium/light color denim great for day time. The denim is soft and lightweight, which is good and bad. Good thing is they are very comfy, the bad thing is that the fabric has a lot more give and stretches more easily than the Revolution wash. I would probably purchase 1 size down.",0
1,These earrings are miniature. Nothing like the seller's picture.,0
5,The owl is adorable.  The chain is kind of chintzy.  But overall it's very nice.,1
3,Very pretty but the keep sliding off.,0
4,Four stars,1
5,"Exactly what I expected, its just beautiful.",1
4,"This was sturdy enough to stay on and stay standing up, I am not sure what it is made out of - but it exceeded my expectations and I would recommend! It lasted even thru two toddlers playing with it and is still going strong as a dress up item.",1
5,The material the quality of the product meto an exceeded my expectations,1
1,Awful!,0
1,It broke after a week.,0
1,Got this as a gift for my son and it broke after 2 days,0
3,These are smaller than the actual shoe size. My son needs my help to put these on because they are so tight. Other than that they look cute.,0
1,It doesn’t fit. Runs very small! Would like to exchange for 2 sizes bigger.,0
2,Great idea.  Great protection.  Lasted 1 month before the front edges started to crack.  I didn't buy the cheapest one because I thought this would be better made.  I was wrong.  I would not buy this again.  I could replace this with cheap stuff 2 or 3 times over for the price.,0
5,Lovely outfit. She got lots of compliments,1
5,Love it,1
5,Liked the soft fabric and fit.  My grandson loves it and has it on when in the house.,1
5,Fits everything I need and more. Inner mesh pocket & outside zip pocket. Along with a handle for carrying.,1
3,"My son loved these shoes, but they tore up on the second day he wore them to school on the play ground. I understand kids play rough sometimes but the elastic part just came loose; he has several pair of shoes similar in style but this has never happened. Cute shoes, but the quality isn't there...I don't think I paid that much, so you get what you pay for!",0
1,Changing from Five stars to one star. I would give it zero if that was an option.  I bought these for my son’s to use in his college dorm’s bathroom. The shower sandal only lasted 3 months.  See pictures attached. This was a rip off and waste of money.,0
4,"works great fits perfectly, easy to put on..... hard to take off again.....",1
3,"The fit was true to size and the graphic is cute. I am not a huge fan of the rolled up sleeves which are stitched in that position but they are ok. If you plan to run in this shirt, be aware the graphic is a plastic iron-on which traps a tremendous amount of heat.",0
1,"Awful, cheap material.  The dress is super long!!!",0
5,These are really cute boots.  They look great with jeans or skinny pants.,1
1,It never worked.,0
2,"Cheaply made, poorly sewn, cool design",0
4,Only thing I don't like is that sleeves are kind of tight. The other overall fit is pretty much as expected.,1
5,Perfect fit and good material.,1
5,Great for air travel or standing for long periods of time.,1
3,I absolutely love this dress... the fit is perfect.. I'm giving it 3 stars because of those gawdy ruffles that you don't see in the pictures...if they just were double sided it would be perect,0
1,El zapato se rompió en la primera puesta.  A la hora quedo separada la cinta del zapato,0
5,Tried out for a week  and i like it be ordering  again this month,1
1,They were too small and not comfortable.  I was surprised because I really like the other socks I have gotten from this company.,0
4,the earrings are small but not flimsy and very cute. would recommend,1
1,The color comes off on your skin underwear and nailpolish,0
1,Cheap feeling material,0
5,Really cute!!,1
5,Good quality and construction-sizing perfect,1
1,The shirt was adorable but the shorts were ill fitting and WAY too big,0
4,Nephew loved them.,1
1,too cheap looking,0
5,"Good deal - I am 6 foot 2 inches and weight 200 lbs. XL shirts fit good, especially across shoulders and torso length.",1
2,"Order up a few sizes! This was tight and fit more like a shirt and not a dress at all. Very pretty colors though, I just wish it would have been true to size.",0
3,Goggles seek to fit well. I docked the rating 2 stars because 2 items were missing arrourding to the box and the instructions; pouch and intrrchangable nose bridges.,0
2,"Loved the atyle, loved the material quality. HATE the sizing. 2XL should be size med. Returning product for refund.",0
5,My daughter bought this for me for grandma day. My first grandchild was born in August. I’ve got our 3 birthstones and the grande/mother/daughter.,1
5,"This is a vine review so my only incentive is to say what I think.  I didn't love the color, but that is a personal thing and I should have gone for black.<br /><br />It's a nice basic, inexpensive bag.  At the price point I would not have been surprised at a more lightweight material, but this was actually pretty strong and sturdier than anticipated.  The sewing, details and strap were well done.  The attachment clasps are a little cheap, but not inappropriate.  The lining is thin/light and might eventually tear but was fine.  Nothing special with the pocket placement.  Zippers worked great.  Size-wise great for a tablet but it's not going to work for a laptop.<br /><br />All in all, a well done inexpensive bag and JTG-recommended.",1
5,These are nice shoes for my young son to use for basketball.,1
3,"Fit well, is a little scratchy. Washed several times and has held up well.",0
5,kids love them.,1
5,"Even though I got my size, the top runs a tad bit smaller on me. It’s kind of snug but still works. You MIGHT need to go up a size. Aside from that, this top is gorgeous and lace makes it look super feminine and becoming. Looking at it right out the package, it doesn’t look that great, but when you put it on, it looks just like the picture. So pretty and you should get it.",1
4,Very cute design with soft fabric.,1
2,"This was beautiful and felt so soft, but it should be noted that I am 5’9” and it was a wedgie maker. I ended up forgetting to drop it off for a refund, so I am stuck with a beautiful item that doesn’t fit.",0
3,Too small for my tiny wrists lmao,0
1,"It's a horrible product, that is made of cheap material",0
2,"This was for my wife, a Rescue Mom. She's small and found the mask surprisingly on the skimpy side. Between its small, tight fit and tight, thick fabric she doesn't like it, feeling too suffocated.",0
5,Very Nice,1
5,Excellent smart but compact crossbody bag.  It has more room than I had expected so I was pleasantly surprised.  Great option for a quick run to any store so overall my great companion and in a color I loved!,1
4,necklace is not top quality. bought another  necklace  and it looks beautiful,1
1,Not as advertised. Cheap material . Sized HUGE NOT FLATTERING. NO GOOD,0
1,"Garbage!  Very cheap, do not waist your money.  Barely resembles the picture.",0
3,"These shirts are made of breathable material especially with summer upon us, they're super lightweight but feels good against my skin. They do however fit a bit shorter nd looser than the average size small polo t-shirts.",0
5,They stretch really well. I swell and they haven't cut my circulation off and they are super comfortable I even sleep with mine on,1
4,kinda uncomfy but very cute :),1
3,"This short didn’t look good on me... it is too long and baggy, not flattering for me",0
5,"The Retro-X Cardigan has not only kept me warm but has also helped me cross borders and make friends all over the world. Why? Because wearing this thing is like having an Old English Sheepdog wrapped around you, especially if you get a plain gray one. The Synchilla has a long, shaggy pile and people just can't help but smile when they see you coming--even grumpy border guards melt once they get a look at you.<br /><br />No, it's not a great piece for active use anymore. This jacket is heavy and bulky. It has a loose, generous cut. Plus the lining isn't breathable and doesn't wick moisture. That's why Patagonia calls it Retro, right? It's pretty amazing this design was once state-of-the-art when you think about it.<br /><br />Bottom line: for non-technical and casual wear, especially when travelling, the Retro-X Cardigan rules. You're warm and everybody's nice to you. Can't beat that!",1
3,Dress was too big. Very dissapointed.,0
5,One of my Favorite dresses ! I wear to work and I get many compliments about it !,1
5,Was a bit leary about having a big gonna on my chest. But I was wrong! Comfortable with all my goodies at the ready. Hiking or driving to the hunting spot.,1
2,Ugly in real life. Never wore them.,0
5,I wore it for a sorority function.  Very beautiful and the colors were just right.,1
1,I followed the size chart but it was somewhat too small.,0
1,The band was too short to even connect- I am a normal size adult and could not buckle the band- was linked a child’s length!!,0
1,They got holes within the first 20mins of my daughters dance class,0
5,Fit my 10 year old grandson prefect.,1
5,Love this for breastfeeding and a very flattering dress postpartum,1
3,Very comfortable! Love the material.,0
2,The mesh is a really thin fabric and rips very easy!!,0
5,I actually love this. The material is magic.,1
5,"I absolutely love these shorts! They are comfortable, fit perfect, and look soooo good on. Should have bought more.",1
3,Material is not as soft as I would<br />Like.,0
5,"Fits true to description, holds up well after a few washes, a little pricy, but my daughter loves them",1
2,"Pros:  Very attractive.  Cons: I only give this necklace 2 stars because the chain seemed to flimsy and my concern was that it might break, therefore, unfortunately I had to return it.",0
1,One of the necklaces broke on day one.,0
5,As Stated,1
3,The earrings are pretty but the picture is misleading.  The gold doesn't look like the picture.,0
3,"Made everything pink ish when I wore it because i reflects all the blue and green lights, but I really liked wearing it. Until it broke 2 weeks later.... So yeah if you can take care of it then go for it.<br /><br />Also! Very easy to scratch the mirror surface.",0
3,They were very pretty but have really stretched out after wearing them for a few weeks,0
5,Perfect!,1
1,Most of them came broken ! Was very disappointed. I couldn't leave it at 0 stars was forced to give 1 star,0
5,"Great product, especially for the price. The wood smells great and they feel very sturdy. Hopefully they will hold up well over time. Would definitely recommend these.",1
5,love the dress . its just like the picture and true to size,1
2,Ok for money useale,0
5,Worth the money. Material is great for winter nights.,1
1,"These are not a true medium!  They are way too big in the waist and fit like a small, possibly even an extra small in the legs.",0
1,My daughter got this for Christmas. She wore it Christmas day. She took it off at bedtime. Next morning when she went to put it on it broke. She only got to wear it once and it broke! She was so upset!,0
5,Fits very comfortably and look super cute! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for large and stylish glasses! The color is great and can be easily matched with any outfit.,1
5,Beautiful and well made,1
3,Not what i expected. They were bigger than i thought.,0
5,"We have a pool with lots of teens coming over to swim. Each swimmer is offered a bag, which several of them have used, keep their own belongings in it, hang it on a hook near the pool and leave it for the next use. Ideal for guests to keep their own things in one place.",1
5,"Got it yesterday, wear it walking my dog...I intentionally order large one, I wear sml or medium so I can put it on top of my jacket.",1
5,GREAT,1
1,My toddler is a size 7.5 in street shoes so I ordered a size 8M in these. What I got appears to be a 10M with the size blacked out (but I can make it out through the marker). They fit like a 10; they’re huge on her.,0
5,This was a very good gift for my friend. It came in spotless condition. It is not to big to mall probably double the size of a quarter.,1
2,Got this as a replacement for my worn out comfort click belt because it was the same ratchet style belt. The problem is the buckle. It doesn't really grip firmly to the end of the belt and has a tendency to come loose.,0
3,"Personally, I think this should be for teenagers. Nice bracelet, but not for a woman. Juvenile looking.",0
1,"I was looking for something smaller that could be worn with more than 1 necklace, so this was too large.",0
5,Excelente,1
1,"back pockets were there, but sewn completely over.  way too tight, could barely button.",0
5,These are durable and I appreciated the magnetic cover,1
1,"The material and colors are wonderful, but the bands are too long and also uncomfortable to put on on your own without anyone’s help.<br /><br />I just can’t keep these.",0
3,Great! Worked well for what I wanted.,0
5,Super comfy and cute!,1
2,"It is difficult to set the time on this watch.  While you are setting it, it jumps forward several minutes at a time, so that it is impossible to set it to the correct time.  I'm not using it.  I would not recommend it to a friend.  I'm reminded that you get what you pay for.",0
3,I have to say I was disappointed with the cheap fabric on the outside . This is the type of material that gets snagged and balled up easy . They are cheaply made in China with no inside tags,0
1,I ordered 2 pairs of earrings and only received one. AND they aren't the correct product.,0
1,"So sad. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL bag, but it broke the second time I used it.<br />I would’ve understood if I was carrying heavy items, however, I had hand sanitizer from target, and my keys. Didn’t even have my wallet or phone.<br />Very disappointed.",0
1,It arrived without the shoulder straps.,0
3,"This is cute, but it's something I'd expect to pick up in a dollar store.  The quality isn't that great, and I'm not confident it will last very long without breaking.",0
5,Sooo pretty,1
5,Like this a lot. Just what a wanted for my everyday glasses in case I need to play tennis with them and not my contacts. Perfect!,1
3,They are beautiful but you can see strings of hot glue but that's fixable.. and the ring is adjustable which is great.. I bought these for my senior prom I hope people love them,0
2,Works like a charm with android phones...but with IOS it just doesn't work. Seems like an IOS issue.,0
3,Much smaller than I expected.,0
1,Horribly small and short. I'm only 5ft and this doesn't even go past my knees. Also is so small it will fit my 10 year old better than an adult.,0
4,I have been wearing non-stop for 2-3 weeks now. Color on the links are the same. The clasp is fading. Thin enough that people think it's real. It would be 5 stars if the clasp didn't fade.,1
3,My daughter loved the color however it ran about a half size too small and the material was super thin. My daughter felt like it was going to rip so easily. Wanted to love it but had to return it. Wish the material was better quality.,0
5,"These shorts may be my favorite clothing purchase on Amazon so far. Very flattering, well made, print as shown and true to size. I'm 5'9 180lbs normally a large or size 12. I ordered a large. My only complaint is they're sold out in my size in other patterns. I can bend over without my butt showing and they're not see through",1
5,Very beautiful and comes well packaged.,1
3,My cousin suggested I buy a beaded necklace or bracelet for my 90 year old aunt to play with.  So I bought this.  Otherwise it's not something I would wear myself.,0
3,I wanted to love these because they’re super comfortable but the length between the crotch and the waistband is so tall! I’d either have to hike them up high or have a saggy crotch. Will be returning.,0
2,The quality and fabric of these pants are not worth the price tag. You can find this same pant at Old Navy or Target for $20. Very disappointed in this pant and ended up returning it.,0
1,Nice quality product. Had a few spots but customer service has been good so far. The pictures are just so they can see the spots.<br /><br />Please contact me once you have viewed the photos.<br /><br />Update: started out very pleased. The customer service was quick and responsive about the stains. Was told to try and lightly wash them out. That didn’t work and I have not been able to get a response from the seller since. That was two days ago.<br /><br />Very disappointed.,0
2,"[[VIDEOID:d8dd82cb133eea03d3cce51c9ff626fb]] I ordered the ALPHAWIN Watch Winder 8 for Automatic Watches to handle all my vintage 'automatic' watches in one case. This is the first 8-watch device I've found and currently this one makes my 4th unit to own. I have to say that the finish is nice but I had to remove what appeared to be random bits of adhesive from it; Strike 1. The design is bassackwards. It is nice having the motors shut down when opening the case door but the design on this case puts that open door right in between you and the watches; Strike 2. Controls are in a very odd location - the backside! What? Yeah, it is nice to have individual control over each spindle but if you have this thing in a tight space, good luck with changing your rotational settings or the lights. Strike 3. I was hoping for so much more from this device because it has the ability to keep 8 watches working and the motors are very quiet. I just think it is a very bizarre design that really isn't user-friendly.",0
1,"It was way to small.  Our 9 year old daughter cannot even fit into it, and the shirt was for my wife.",0
1,No elasticity. Ruined after one time use. Falls off the knee. Very disappointed,0
2,"This back pack has fallen apart since day one.  It started with the attachments (little bear pins, etc), not losing the pins, but the little pins falling apart. Then one of the two zippers came off the track with no way to fix it, then the back pack started ripping apart at the top.  The straps wouldn't stay tightened until we tied knots into them.  So not even 1 semester into school, and it's garbage now.  The tote works somewhat, and the lunchbox are the only things left!  My granddaughter is heartbroken, because we had to wait a long time for the delivery. Big disappointment!!",0
1,Attractive but runs small - - t-shirt weight material,0
5,"This is SO flattering.  My first day wearing it and I received SO many compliments!!  It's very comfortable.  I'm 5'4&#34; 119 and the small is just a tad on the big side, but still looks amazing.  I do wear a bralette under for work so it's not so revealing (not much to show off anyway).  I will be ordering more in the future.  Great price, too!",1
5,I ordered a size up for my daughter and it fit perfectly.  She loves the ears on the hood.  Very well made.,1
5,ND Fans here’s your Hat!,1
1,"very pretty, but a piece of total junk-low quality.",0
4,Too large... we gonna keep it for later.,1
2,Not for a short person. The high waist is too high and makes the whole upper section awkward.,0
2,"Although item was well made, it was not the item that is pictured.  I ordered a navy body with grey sleeves and a flared bottom hem to be worn with leggings.  I was sent a shirt that was grey with black sleeves and had absolutely no &#34;flare&#34; to the bottom at all.  It looked and fit like a T-shirt.  Not at all what was shown and totally different colors.",0
1,Wore twice before the batteries corroded.,0
5,What you see is what you get.  These are very much worth the small price.,1
3,It looks really nice. However it falls off SUPER easy. Mine has fallen on many times with just the slightest bump of it.,0
2,The description says one 2 pack but I only got one brick.,0
3,Didn't like back of hat once fit all strap adjusted.,0
5,Very durable<br />Right fit<br />Really like the pre package separate bags,1
5,Beautiful necklace,1
3,Very cute yet still trying to figure out if I'm going to be embarrassed wearing in public. I am a wayfarer kind of girl but wanted to try the mirrored lenses look. These sunglasses seemed to fit the bill. They have a futuristic look to them though that I'm not sure about. My husband started singing Mr. Roboto to me when I tried them on for him. However now he says they have grown on him and he thinks they are cool. They almost look like a piece of art! I got the silver with violet lenses.,0
2,Broke within 2 days,0
5,Love it! Just what I needed to save all my money while at the casino.  This is the best thing for anyone trying to go back home with all your winning from the casino.,1
5,I LOVE this bracelet!,1
5,love it,1
1,"I ordered two pairs of these shorts at the same time, only different colors. Both were supposed to be size large. Clearly the pink ones are much smaller. They do not have tags on them so I have no idea what size either of them truly are. The gray are a more cotton blend and the pink are a silkier material. It said nothing about them being different, only difference should have been the colors. I definitely cannot fit in the pink ones. Also the drawstring fell out of the pink ones and I haven’t even worn them yet. Trying to think of a thinner person I can give them too. Half happy and half disappointed with these shorts.",0
2,"I had a blue version of this shirt that fit ok with the large size, but the white one was SUPER tight. So, at best, the sizing is very inconsistent.  They are advertised as slim fit, but they are really closer to skinny fit.",0
2,"These shrunk after the first washing, very dissappointed!",0
3,"liked the idea and picture, but thought it poor quality and smaller than I ad hoped",0
5,"[[VIDEOID:cfdabf6de535af60bd8bf880c536d7b4]] The studs are small, but you can tell from the product picture so no surprise. Love love love the rainbow hoop! Easy to put in, and way cute! Absolutely thrilled.",1
5,I love these and so does my husband! The fit is perfect and they are so comfortable and extremely breathable! Im 5'2 and 240 and ordered a 2xl and they fit perfectly!,1
2,The mechanism to close the umbrella did not work properly. I returned it.,0
4,"Color was not as dark as in picture but it fits nicely. Very lightweight, can be worn with a jacket on top. Material is very soft and comfortable on skin.",1
5,"I purchased these white goldish sandal a size bigger(""5"") for my toddler and when I tried them on her they fir her perfect with no room to grow. I will definitely be ordering more in bigger sizes. I advise you to size up 2 sizes in my opinion. The seller was amazing and refunded my money back.",1
5,lightweight and comfortable. sweat wicking and breathable! I can wear these at the gym or under regular shirts for extra warmth. They give the body a nice silhouette without being tight. Would purchase again!,1
3,Very easily wrinkles - cheap material. Sent back,0
5,Nice,1
1,HUGE,0
5,It's as advertised,1
5,"Awesome reusable bags! They are sturdy, easy to clean, and hold a ton! The checkers at the grocery stores are always impressed by these. My town charges a fee to use store bags so it’s great to keep these in my car ready for whenever I go to the store. So glad I found these and am very happy with them.",1
1,Too small and the front strip digs into the top of your foot when sliding them on. The heel also hangs off the back due to not being able to slide feet fully into the slipper.,0
5,Good value and light to wear,1
4,"Love the thin socks. The colors and patterns are super fun. The ankles were a bit snug, but not uncomfortable. Great purchase.",1
1,The dress runs small and is very short. The fabric is awful. I would not recommend this dress. Thoroughly disappointed.,0
5,"This is the Star my son bought a few years back and haven't been able to find for a very long time. Price was great, Got it in about 8 days. The exact star I was searching for. Beautiful piece. Very masculine. Not to large. It's just right for me. Has a shinny side and a flat metal side. Stainless steel. I LOVE THIS STAR! Not a cheap looking Star of David. I'm kind of a thick guy and you will need a thicker chain than what comes with it. Chain included id to short and way to thin for such a good sized piece. I ordered a custom length stainless steel O link style chain here from Amazon through KONOV at 4mm and 23&#34; length. Could have done 3mm and if you want longer go 24&#34;. Very happy with the chain as well. Said it could take a month to receive from China but received it in a week. Perfect for this Star. RUSH Industries was good to buy from and shipping was included. They have other nice stuff as well. I think you will like this item.",1
5,After trying several products this one is AWESOME ! This product is perfect for wearing covid masks and glasses.<br />One quick spray in each lens does the trick 😉,1
5,Beautiful,1
1,Don't buy this material is really poor,0
5,Great buy,1
5,"Great fabrics, wonderful selection of prints that match the panel perfectly. Well cut, well packed, and promptly shipped. Highly recommend.",1
5,Very nice fit. Well made. Beautiful purple.,1
1,All the copper paint came off after only 1-2 uses. Awful product.,0
5,My mother loves ten!,1
1,Way too small in the waist and way too long,0
3,Love the sunglasses however they are NOT gradient like they say!,0
5,As describbed.,1
2,"Not very shiny. Its black, but not really appropriate for black tie.",0
2,Beautiful dress however they are cut extremely big. No where near true to size. I order 2. One for my teen and one for myself for a wedding that we was in. Delivery was extremely slow. Made it just in time for the wedding. We had to tie an extender to the hanger straps and tie the straps together to hold the dresses up since they were so big. If you are ordering down size your order.,0
5,Well worth the purchase! Replaced my sons broken necklace quickly and easily!,1
1,Junkie,0
2,"Holy smokes.... These leggings are made of a material that feels nice on the skin but....BUT....they are SO long. And long not in the actuall leg part. But long in the waist part. These things came all the way up to my bra line. As in, if it had straps I'd call it a body suit. It's ridiculous. Not a comfortable fit.",0
2,"These glasses feel cheap. One arm already fell off, the screw is just gone. Nothing is broke, the screw just fell out. They are super cute though.",0
3,"If you don't have a butt you should be fine😂😂😂 But if you are well endowed they will sit extra low in the back....sliding down, showing panties low. The front is almost to the bra line.",0
5,"I am IN LOVE with this dress! So much so that I've worn it two days in a row...I tied a knot in the bottom to give it a little sass. It's the perfect summer dress and I hope to get one in every color!<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 155lbs...ordered a large. May try a medium next time but it isn't NECESSARY- I'd say it's true to size.",1
1,Way too small :(,0
4,"This pack is nice and small, good for a day on the slopes.  Lunch,  GoPro, spare goggle lenses, snacks, hat, socks, gator pretty much fill it up.  Fits nicely but watch that it doesn't catch on the back of the lift chair.",1
5,Comes with 2 filters. Great picture of a Yorkie.,1
4,"Size chart needs to be fixed. I matched my size 34 with the chart. When the order arrived the shorts were too large by at least one size bigger. The return shipped as fast, easy, and convenient.",1
1,WAY too heavy. These things would rip my ears if I tried to wear them.,0
5,Do these shoes provide good arch support?,1
2,Well I received my package and I was excited but when I went to put then in I noticed that the barbell are very short they didn't specify the length of them I.thought they would at least be standard piercing size I will order again only if listing sizes other than that I like the color.of the balls,0
5,Fits lovely. I will buy again soon,1
2,They did not look as flashy in person but okay.,0
3,Really thin fabric. Sleeves and bottom do not have a finished edge.  It doesnt' look really bad but you can really tell it is a cheap blouse. Not really worth the money but it is not worth the hassle to return it.,0
3,"Definitely more of a light weight rather than a mid-weight sock, which is a little disappointing since I was hoping for socks to help keep my feet warmer. Maybe I should have expected that from a free-style sock. Haven't tested them out skiing yet, but they will likely have to be spring-ski socks for warmer weather. I do love the pattern and the slight mismatch between the two socks, so for that I'll keep them. Foot of the sock fit as expected, but if you have slightly larger calves, they are a bit tight. I don't expect to have any problems with them staying up though, and they have nice cushioning on the shin and heel. Also very soft.",0
4,"It's a great quality belt, though I would've preferred it to be more of a raven-black than a brown-black.",1
1,"As long as a nightgown, the strap is odd length as well, I washed it one time and it shredded",0
1,You expect this big gaudy bling looking ring with cute lil shiny fake crystals/Dimonds it's super pathetically tiny the ring looks nothing like the photo. The crystals are just flat shiny metal studs. Super sad quality Not even with 3 bucks. Super misleading.,0
1,Doesn’t fit at all,0
4,I love this shirt - bought it for family pictures when I got married. Its a little on the loose side (I typically wear a M/8) but not so much that it looks or feels too big.,1
1,No good quality,0
5,I would buy it again in other colors.,1
2,Tank tops were too tight. I ordered a size larger than usual because I really wanted roomier and comfy. Apparently I should have gone 3 sizes larger.,0
5,Super cute and fit perfect for Halloween costume,1
5,The product is very good. I loved the material. It looked great one me. The product is a s expected.,1
3,"The color was beautiful but the lace is a huge crochet type lace, not delicate lace as I was expecting. I sent it back.",0
4,"These straps help me keep my glasses on when wearing a mask.  Initially they work very well, but eventually become loose.  Their shelf life is short and frequently need to be replaced with a new one.",1
3,Just okay. Ended up sending it back,0
4,Got them for my mother in law as a gift. They are nice just not what I expected.,1
1,I did what it said use warm water and oil etc still left sticky adhesive all over my chest and my shirt stuck to my chest gettin this adhesive all over one of my favorite shirts also it was not easy getting off at all never again I regret buying this hot garbage,0
5,These really are beautiful and a nice small size,1
5,I love this dress and I bought two. They fit perfectly and are pretty comfortable.  Pockets!!! love them. I plan to buy more when summer comes back!,1
5,Fits as shown on the picture,1
1,"don't buy, material is very stiff and the cuff is very small, may be it will fit a 10 years old girl.  The length is too short it will not protect your arm for cooking and preventing from splashing.  Will return this item.  I was looking forward to get it but very disappointed when received.  Also it is not a free return if you want UPS to pick up so i have to drop off . (misleading when it said free return)",0
5,"It actually fit better than expected.  It was lightweight.  It fit snug enough to go over my nose, but under my ears, yet didn't feel restrictive or tight.  It's the first one that I've tried on that allowed me to speak normally without my speech sounding muffled.  The length is long enough that you can adjust the face mask to meet the safety risk by doubling, tripling, or even quadrupling the fabric or leaving it at single layer depending on the environment that you are traveling through.  This is going to be your best option for children going to school simply for the reason that it's the least annoying.  You honestly hardly notice that you're wearing it.  It doesn't make you feel hot or uncomfortable.  There are even stylish color options.  I'm not an easy customer to please on mask issues.  I have asthma, and many that I tried left me feeling short of air and overheated if I had to wear them for a lengthy time.  I could do this mask all day long on single layer and not be bothered.  I love the fact that I can double or triple the layers by folding it differently, and walk indoors for a doctor's apt.  I love the fact that I can scrunch it up, turn it into a figure 8, and wear it around my wrist when I'm walking the dog along a path that has no other people.  If you wish to exercise while wearing a mask, or you have an active child, this one is going to be preferable over others that you have tried.  This is my honest opinion.  I received no benefit from giving them a glowing recommendation other than knowing that my advice might help others to discover a mask that they can fall in love with if they are required to wear one.",1
1,"Extremely flimsey, and doesn't hold shape.  Could not get the earring to clasp, ended up bending all out of shape, can't wear them now.  Don't bother!",0
5,"Looks like good quality, well made.",1
5,Exactly what I wanted.  Very cute.,1
1,Can't see through eye holes. Can't even keep on for 1 minute cause of the latex smell gives you a headache!,0
2,The sweatshirt  is very lightweight and not what I expected. Sent back.,0
5,"Great product,  fits as expected, will purchase again",1
5,"This double bell silver charm is the perfect size for my granddaughters charm bracelet. It will be given to her at her Christmas piano recital. She is playing ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day"" .  She loves it when friends ask her about all her charms on her bracelet. She tells them that each charm is given by Grammy and it represents the song she has played.",1
2,Terrible material,0
5,My husband just retired and I purchased this as a gift. He has a smaller head and found this fits him perfectly. It’s very breathable and therefore will be wonderful for hot weather.,1
5,I wear it every day!! Thank you so much! Will buy more soon!,1
2,"First, the dress fabric is great and comfy. The colors are awesome too. Unfortunately, the way it is cut is very unflattering. The dress balloons out at the hips because the pocket placement is odd. Then it tapers back in at the ankles. The proportions are very off. I tried to adjust this dress, but every attempt made me feel like a clown in a potato sack. I'm disappointed because I really wanted to like it, but sadly I am returning it.",0
5,They fit perfectly and my granddaughter loves them!,1
5,My son was real excited to get this shirt so I was a bit worried because of past purchases of sizing issues but this shirt was a thumbs up in every area!  The size was perfect. The quality is great and the price was reasonable. Happy kid happy mom!,1
3,Dress is pretty but felt somewhat small and length was a bit long.  Was afraid it might shrink and become too tight so returned it.,0
4,I’m 168pd 5’9 36D and I ordered a large.. My top fit perfect but the pants was a lil loose but overall it was a nice fit,1
1,Very small and was defective,0
3,"The material is OK, and the size (large) is also OK, but the problem is that the design itself has a problem, that when you bring your arms forward or raise them, you feel the sleeves tighten around the arms. Obviously the arm openings should be redesigned to allow to give free movement.",0
2,"I bought these as a gift for my 8 year old granddaughter and though they say they're adult sized, I wonder if they will be too small. Not what I was expecting.",0
5,My son gets tons of compliments on his unique tie.  It's quite the attention getter and conversation starter.,1
1,Very disappointed. It says take to dry cleaners and yet this still happens. Images disappeared the lady at the cleaners apologized and didn't charge me but this is ridiculous,0
5,"Super soft, large and a pretty color. Love them.",1
4,small,1
5,"It was packaged well and came in 2 days. This is really an inexpensive bra compared to other brand but it hugged pretty well. I like that it is convertible and can be worn with strap or without strap under a sleeveless dress or shirt. It’s good material too, comfortable with a supportive lift.",1
2,"These look great, no complaints about that. However, for some reason they made them with no extra room in the chain, on the clasp side—it’s right against the choker. Never had a piece of jewelry like that. The widest choker is extremely difficult to maneuver, it’s stupid, especially if you have acrylic nails-don’t even bother buying unless there is someone around to take it on and off for you LOL.",0
4,Nice and dainty.,1
5,100%,1
5,Packaging had no damage item is much better in person my daughter loves it,1
4,gift,1
5,"Love this dress! It looks more expensive than it is and I get compliments when I wear it. I am 5'3 and I have to wear platforms. If you are short, you will need to get it hemmed.",1
5,"Ordered these for my granddaughter to take camping.  She is between sizes 12 and 13.  I read others reviews and decided to order the 12 thinking that when they get heavier when wet the 13 might fall off her feet. Shoes came today, and I had her try them on.  They fit pretty snugly on her feet when dry, but she says they feel comfortable and she loves the teal blue color.  We have not gotten them wet yet so I can't comment on whether they will stretch or not.  I am going to keep them because they seem well made, but I realize now that she will probably only be able to wear them for the remainder of this summer.  In hindsight I wish I would have ordered up to the size 13 to give her a bit more room, but that is not the fault of the shoemaker so I am giving 5 stars for appearance and comfort.",1
5,Super cute and super comfortable. It is a little see through,1
5,Comfortable.  Daughter loves them,1
1,The Gloves Are Very Sticky,0
2,I’m usually a medium but this one was a little too small. It was nice so I was sad it didn’t fit.,0
1,Did not work.  Had to return it.,0
4,"Good quality leggings, aren't thin or too stretchy.but they are a little small",1
1,I don't know where they're finding these people for measurements?-- but this is not a 4x it is the size of x-large.  Return!,0
1,"Disappointed.  Several were hard to put on, and about 10 didn't even work.  Would not recommend.  No replacement batteries were included,",0
2,"Item is described as being decorated by &#34;top quality leather&#34;.  What is more accurate is that it has PU Leather, which IS NOT leather at all. PU Leather is a synthetic MAN MADE material. Pleather is more accurate. I will be returning these.",0
5,One of my fav PJ shirts!,1
1,No good,0
5,Very nice watch love the look and comfortable fit,1
3,not what I expected.,0
1,Is it pretty looking? Yes! Is it cheap feeling though? Double yes. Plus they cheated me on an inch. So instead of 18 inches its 17. So it won't work for me. Also it didnt come with any packaging but a little zip lock baggy so returning it will cost me more headache than I care. So in the trash it will go. Yay money down the drain.,0
5,I love how pretty these are! The colors are vibrant and the size is perfect for what I wanted. I am usually pretty sensitive but these did not cause any irritation. The price is pretty reasonable too. Highly recommend!,1
2,Didn’t like it over stretches and looses shape,0
5,Very good,1
3,"Cotton will not only fade, but will shrink",0
1,Too big,0
3,"Solid color, no labels showing. Aesthetically pleasing in their simplicity, but they run a bit on the small side. I'm a size 10 wide, and they were too snug all around. Uncomfortable and noticed them all day long.<br /><br />So if your feet are slightly smaller than average, they should be fine. If you're larger than a size 9, I'd look elsewhere.",0
5,"Loved this dress.  I wish I would have gotten an XS (but I don’t think they had that as an option.<br />SO.... the main reason I love this dress??? Aside from it being comfy, I tried it on wearing a sports bra to see how it fits, and it perfectly covered the sports bra!!!!  A dress and not a real bra?!?! Everyone’s dream.",1
5,Just as described,1
5,Perfect fit❤️,1
5,I meant to give this company 5 stars on a previous review...I confused which article I was reviewing...nice outfit....,1
4,"Despite the inaccuracies of the size chart, I was able to use the information provided by other customers to find the correct size for me.  I am 5'4&#34; ,170 lbs, have broad shoulders, a positive ape index, and a generally large frame.  I usually wear a US size 14 and found that the XL shirt fits me just fine.  The cuffs are faux French.  You button the cuff and then fold the cuff over.  Note that these are not real French cuffs and cannot be used with cufflinks.  However, I plan to remove the buttons and cut a slit in each cuff so that I can wear my cufflinks.  Good price for the shirt.",1
2,not as described,0
5,OMG!!!  This dress is so stinking cute.  We had several ask where we purchased it when she wears it.  Love the length bc it’s much longer then other dresses that end up being too short .  Thick material and hangs good.,1
1,"The molding did not work, and the bottom grill would not stay put on bottom teeth",0
5,Perfect dress,1
5,Love Merrell,1
2,i wanted to love these and hoped for them to be fashionable ish but comfortable but opposite- harsh fabric with no stretch.,0
1,Bought these for a trip to Italy. They broke in the packaging before I could even wear them. Disappointed!,0
3,"I like the shape and color options in this dress. However, I'm 5'6, 135lbs and ordered a medium. If I bend over, you can see up the dress. I'm a teacher and looking for dresses to wear to school. This won't work. Might be good just to wear around the house or to run errands though.",0
3,Shape is not as pictured. Seems form fitted.... Well.... it is a short square. I'll still ware it but I was disappointed.,0
4,"Geniales, parecen cómodas y baratas",1
4,Most of my purchases were great and I would definitely buy and recommend them to family and friends.,1
5,Very cute sneakers for a 3 year old,1
5,Perfect fit and very comfortable,1
2,"It's a decent vest but it smells terrible, like FISH. I AM RETURNING THIS ASAP!",0
2,"Okay for starters I am scrunch bum Ho and am constantly purchasing new ones and sets so I feel qualified in leaving a review on these for sure. I've bought similar styles on Here and have loved them so this one I expected to love also but this was a miss. The image clearly is from the CBL brand product, the color is super super dull and has a weird pale yellow tint to it. There is an abnormally tall mod section from crotch to top so it didn't look very faltering. The biggest problem I had tho was with the scrunch itself. The scrunch should be positioned in the actual bumm area not at the top of the waist line. It looked really really funky having a booty scrunch at the low back instead of bum area to the point I wouldn't wear it outside the house or at home at all. I wanted to love these so much 😭",0
2,Was perfect but I snagged it and it broke. It is so tiny there is no way to repair it.,0
5,Perfect,1
5,Love this product keeps dirty shoes off of clothing.,1
3,I am overall satisfied with this purchase- it's good quality and an awesome price. It would just be nice if it were taller- my necklaces still drag on my dresser.,0
4,Awesome dress. Soft. Great pockets. I'm taking a star off for the color. This is more pink than the blush color shown in the picture.,1
3,"Comfy and fluffy, but they sent me the wrong color (I ended up with the pink camo instead of the plum), and it is too much of a hassle to return something during a pandemic, so I am stuck with this color that I don't like that much.  Probably not worth $75.  If ever they are on sale for $40 and you can get the color you want, they would be a worthwhile purchase.",0
5,Very cute and comfortable.  didn’t move around like I expected,1
5,"Love the dress,  super comfy and will definitely  recommend ordering.",1
3,"I ordered a 1xl (20-22w), which is larger than my normal 18, & the shirts are a bit short. They don't quite reach my waist, so some of my mid section shows. I just ordered them as shirts to wear around the house, so its not a complete waste. I wish they had bigger sizes, I'd order them again, they are super soft & comfy.",0
5,"Really cute dress, fits perfect",1
5,Looks good!,1
4,"This necklace is pretty awesome, but it's heavy!",1
1,One of the stones was missing before it was even worn.,0
5,Adorable!,1
3,"Nice looking, however the posts are super soft and easily bends. Would not order again.",0
5,Super soft and cute and nice waistband so you can adjust,1
3,"The yellow is not yellow as pictured, but very clearly a shade of orange.",0
2,These are really nice and don't look cheap. I give it 2 stars because they come loose and my brown one broke. It's a easy fix but them coming loose is irritating.,0
3,"These leggings are butter soft. They fit great, I just wish they were tighter around the tummy for support.",0
1,its different from the picture. and it always<br />tangle and need to fix it all the time.,0
4,"The Sonja Betro Knit/Lace Sleeve Babydoll Tunic is cute. It is oversized and comfortable. The fabric is cool (100% cotton) and easy to maintain (machine washable). You can wear it with leggings, jeans or shorts. I would describe it as having an empire waistline with slight gathers. My only warning is that it has the potential to make you look fat if you aren’t careful, depending on your body shape. Overall, 4 stars.",1
3,"Looks good and appears well made. One issue is that the clips are not flat so could show through, but more importantly they have sharp edges at the pivot points, so they could snag on the pants depending on the fabric, like linen.",0
5,"I like the bracelet, got it for my granddaughter.",1
5,"Cute, good quality, very large",1
5,I love this necklace.  It is smooth and versatile looking so I can wear it with almost anything and it looks great.  And it has helped my stiff neck that I had for a month to go away.  That is super!,1
5,I love these pants,1
5,"I really like these. I ordered an extra large and they are comfortable, a tad loose for a spandex type product. These are not spandex tho. The material is good quality and not thin but breathable. I like the little pocket. On me, I’m 5’3 and they come to about 2” above my knee.",1
5,Great quality,1
1,Within less than 2 months the rivets fell off the pockets.  Am now outside of return window even though the pants are clearly defective.  I am shocked given the price.  I won't ever buy any products from this company again.,0
4,Loved this color and material. Very comfortable. The only thing is the shorter end that has the slot on the hand broke.,1
3,If I don't wear it everyday it stops. Great looking watch.,0
5,"I was able to put two of my size 8 1/2 shoes in these bags. With my sneakers, I could only fit a pair of flip flops with it. But that is still good. I didn't have to carry a lot of shoe bags for my weekend trip. I loved that I could look in the bag while zipped up to get what shoe I needed. Excellent concept. This worked well for me.",1
2,"I expected the material to be different, not as thin... Then the button was rather cheap and it feels like it's going to break. Plus it dose not fit as expected, it's too large and the waist is too high on then and the legs are short.",0
5,These straps instantly became my favorite! Theyre very comfortable and look almost like the original but you can barely tell the difference. Will definitely purchase the other color variations,1
3,They are like regular gym tops.  No compression whatsoever.,0
1,Doesn't have much stretch and large is more of a smaller medium. Could not even get them over my butt.,0
3,"These work great so long as they stay intact. About a month into using them, one alligator clip mysteriously popped off and has disappeared into never never land. I can’t find it anywhere. Unfortunate because they were perfect otherwise.",0
1,I couldn’t wear this watch band because only 1 of the 2 parts to the band would attach to my Garmon Forerunner 645. The edge of the leather stuck out too far to insert the spring action pin into watch.<br /><br />The pins also were not springing back like normal. They had to be pushed both ways.<br /><br />I sent the band back and a new one is coming. Honestly I have little hope it will be any better.,0
5,I am disabled and spend more than 75% of my days reclining in a hospital bed or recliner. My clothes need to be comfortable over all but I wouldn’t mind if they could be cute as well. I got the pink pair. I love them so much I’m going to order more!,1
5,This is top quality and has a great nautical vibe.  Adorable.,1
4,"Very cute. Mermaid dress is a beautiful blue and the embroidery is good quality. However, it does run small. I order 6 for my 4YO and it just fits.",1
5,"Bought it as a gift for my niece who had never worn alpaca before. Loved it - Fine, cuddly-soft, genuine alpaca quality! Highly recommend!",1
3,Product is ok. Color is nice. just longer than i thought,0
5,Arrived before expected! So comfi. Love it.,1
1,Cheep hats don't buy,0
5,This Shawl is so great to have.<br />I gave one shawl to my sister. In return she gave it to her son for a father day gift.,1
3,A little disappointed in how cheaply it was made. Even if its not real people should take pride and make it look good. The blue stone is glued crooked in the center of the heart.,0
5,100% satisfied but 39mm is a little bit smaller than my wrist,1
2,"I am 5'10&#34;, I normally wear a size 6 dress, but ordered the next size up just to be safe.  You can imagine how upset I was when I put the costume on for the first time and the bottom of my butt was showing.  I looked at the package again to check the size, and to my surprise, the size chart had a height section of 5'7-5'9.  Had the website stated that, I wouldn't have wasted my money.",0
1,This is for a 'small teen' not for a small woman!  super cheap material too.,0
2,"They are not very comfortable, too stiff. Not as cozy as I thought they would be.",0
5,Fits perfect,1
3,"Fit  a little tight, but I am losing weight so I will keep because I like the cut.",0
1,L/XL not true to size....returned them,0
3,"It is delicate, I would say flimsy, but in that direction with great lenses performance.<br />I don't see this lasting many years...",0
5,Very durable and light weight.,1
5,Synced quickly and works well.,1
1,Very cheap material; I never even wore them... my experience isn’t everyone’s but for me these were definitely not what I’d expected and not what is pictured.,0
5,It’s perfect to go to graduations and sporting events where clear bags are needed,1
5,Fit and feel are great.,1
2,"[[VIDEOID:470bae44e585704a3cd01a19d87d7e9a]] The product looks amazing. The size was perfect for my son's ipad, laptop, etc....<br /><br />School started in late August & the straps tore apart at the seam by mid September. Funny thing is that NO BOOKS are carried as text books are all digital. And the 2nd strap is going as well. We had to purchase another from a different manufacturer.",0
3,"Size wise it was slightly small around my shoulders, which is not entirely unexpected. I'm 6'0 185 athletic and I usually wear medium. I got the M size based on the sizing chart they provided.I ordered this exactly because its slim fit and snug, and it does fit nicely around my midsection, but I also have bigger shoulders and chest so I guess this is made for skinnier guys. The size is not why I'm giving this a 3/5. The material just looks and feels cheap, and for $40 I think I can do better. I'm still debating whether I should keep this or return it, but one thing is for sure, im not impressed at all.",0
2,Seam of the shoulders was off shoulders by 3 inches front was benched would not recommend.,0
3,These seemed a little on the thin side considering I got black ones from the same brand that we're better than this. It does what it needs to for me and my team for now,0
1,"I’m not exactly sure we can call these socks.  I mean, they kinda looked like fun socks … but these were NOT socks.  Strips of straight, unstretchable fabric sewn together.  Couldn’t get them past my heel.  After sweating profusely attempting to do so, because I was determined to wear these babies, I quickly realized once I was able to force the “sock” over the heel, it was impossible to pull up!  Zero stretch means no matter how skinny your calf is, these socks will have you believing you’re fat.  Couldn’t get them past my ankle bone!!  I felt like a girl in high school trying hard to get those jeans on that once fit.  The struggle is REAL with this product!!!  Be sure to reserve extra time for the second shower you’ll need after all the sweat and tears, and yes, there will be tears, too, you put in for one sock.  Also remember, now you’ll have to put on the second one!  Holy hell.",0
5,Good size and meets venue requirements for concerts and sporting events. I wanted crossbody and this was exactly what I needed!,1
5,"My girls loved these charms. Prior to these I had ordered metals ones, however the loops were too small and had to return those. These are perfect and colorful. They will last a long time.",1
4,Very comfortable and well worth the price. The sizing is small by US standards. I normally wear a large but had to go with an XL for the shoulders and sleeve length. I love the shirt!,1
5,"Doublju Womens High Waist Midi A-Line Skirt 3XL . ordered 2 patterns<br />I am 5'1"" these skirts fit fantastic.  my sisters were ooh-ing over them.  You must check the measurements for the sellers. this determines whether you wear their 2XL or 3XL the length is modest for me as i am too chunky for skirts below my knee. I must cover my knees and the bigger upper part of my legs to carry off a midi length skirt.  These fell 3"" below my knee .  The colours were as pictured. sorry i tried taking a photo but not getting a good shot with my arms lifted.  I will send a photo if my son is around when am online.  The material is lovely and thick but enough to fall nicely you may not need an underslip but you can get an opinion when you wear it. 3XL people go get yourselves one.  I was waiting for the order to arrive to release what i have in my cart.  Great buy!!!!<br />UPDATE: i added a photo of one of the shirts",1
1,not a good quality. it was smooth to touch but not high waist. it only one inch width elastic and little bit long for the height of 5'4''.,0
3,The sandals are not exactly like the picture but look very similar. I like them and get many compliments when wearing them.,0
2,"I was super excited to receive these a gift for Mother's Day from my husband since I am a librarian. However, after one day of wearing these earrings, they fell apart. The back picture of books came off both earrings. Luckily, they're double-sided so it's not a complete loss, but it was still disappointing.",0
5,Nice gear S2 watch band. Classy band and has held up great and got me many compliments. Would buy again.,1
5,Great buy good quality!!!,1
5,"CUTE! It’s a great, easy summer dress. I’m not crazy about the material, but I expected it. I wouldn’t wear it to a fancy event or anything like that, but it’s great for what it is! I plan on running my 3 kiddos around all summer in it. Great for pool/beach coverup. Traveling...etc. everything I need it to be! I ordered the XL!",1
3,The charm doesn't have the detail or stamp thats shown on the picture provided on the website. I looked up a test to validate the authenticity of the metal and the charm seem to pass the ice cube test. So by the test standards the sterling silver is real.,0
4,"Washed them first, they're comfortable.",1
4,This is not your traditional thermal material they look and feel a lot like women's leggings but they have a fly in the front and my husband said they are comfortable,1
1,Too small,0
2,Don’t change the product for the worse…,0
5,"I was nervous about using an iron on transfer with the bag, but they worked perfectly.  There was no melting and the iron on vinyl was quick and easy to apply.  Very economical way to make custom bags for our entire tennis team.",1
5,nice shirt,1
1,For a short time this case was great but after 2-3 cm day the case started to break chunks of the edges..... not happy but it will do,0
5,Gorgeous !,1
3,Had issues with the zipper,0
5,"Loved these stylish, lightweight sunglasses!!<br />Great gift!!",1
4,"I like the material, so easy to take care of.  The length is pretty good.  I like my tops longer, so it works for me.  I like the fact that it slims your tummy look, also.  Shipping time was good and I've had no issues with it.  I will buy a few more in different colors.",1
3,Nothing special personally but maybe someone else would like it.,0
2,"Feels cheap, looks cheap ordered a small but it fits like a juniors- wish I would have ordered a medium. :(",0
5,Bought it got it.,1
4,The dragonfly is very small.  It is a pretty necklace but I am giving it to my granddaughter.,1
5,I like the dress. I do wish the appliqué around the shoulder would have been stiff so it would stay upright.,1
1,My earlobes turned green and swollen.  Cheap metal. Don't buy.,0
3,I expected it to be more sturdy. Its flimsy so it snags and bends...,0
1,"material is so thin, you cap practically see through it, unraveled after first washing. Does not even make a good rag! Don't waste your time or money!",0
1,Turned colors and earrings didn't stay hooked.,0
3,"I love the material and the sleeves, it's a cool cut however I ordered the largest size so it would be loose and it's not at all! Fits like a L-Xl",0
2,Super cute put caused me major ankle problems because of the lack of support.,0
5,Great quality and feel.  Overall great training gear for the price.!!,1
3,Smaller than chart size,0
5,Beautiful necklace wish it was a bit shorter but overall great quality!,1
1,"It fits ok except, it’s right on the arms. My arms are not fat. I’m guessing it runs small",0
3,I ordered a larger size but it was still too small and I cannot wear it. I will order XXL for any other purchases in the future.,0
2,The neck is too high making the vest uncomfortable,0
4,"Nice fabric, but it was a little larger than I expected it to be. A little longer than I really wanted.",1
2,Its very flimsy and I thought  it would work in my cartilage piercing. Not. I finally get it in and there's no locking mechanism to close it. General piercing and taking it off every night would probably work. Also you only get one earring.,0
4,"I bought two of these... one for my two year old and one for my six year old. The hat for my two year old was much too big. The hat for my six year old seemed to fit much better. The &#34;mustache strap&#34; kept unbuttoning from the hat, which was frustrating at times, but I do like the concept of this hat.",1
5,Product is very comfy. I wear it for 12+ hours with no irritation or slipping. Color and design is beautiful. I always get lots of compliments on it.,1
5,"Good quality and very attractive print. Happy with my purchase and would buy again. The tag said 100% silk, I have no reason to doubt it.",1
4,"Very pretty dress! Very see-through (ivory color) and quite short. I’m only 5’4, so it’s rare for dresses to be “too short” on me, but this one is pretty darn short. It’s just a tad tight around my 38DD chest. XL would probably fit better. Overall cute for the price, but not the highest quality (which I expected.)",1
4,Thought they were a wider frame size but other than that nice sunglasses.,1
5,Thank you for such a beautiful bracelet I really enjoy it.,1
2,Very pretty. But it broke the day after I got it,0
3,I bought this for the second time a year after my first one started getting worn out ( my old laptop weighed a ton and was hard on it) .. and am disappointed to say my the quality has really gone done.  It’s okay.. but not the great it used to be.,0
5,The sizes run a little big. I ordered a small and it was a little larger than expected.,1
2,Kinda big they slip down a lot and are shorter than I expected I’m only 5’5” and they don’t touch the ground..,0
5,Great just what wanted,1
3,The bottom seems very slippery so it makes me feel unsafe when I wear these out.,0
5,Love these.  They fit right over my glasses perfectly!,1
1,Received today and excited to gift to my niece but highly disappointed as it has both a horrible smell and the screen print is printed poorly and smudged. I could not recommend based on this poor quality.,0
5,Good buy and as described,1
5,Colors are beautiful and feels very silky.,1
1,"Baby small, they trying to sale you the adult size but send child size. this shirt is for a 10 to 12 years old I'm 51 the crazy thing it was for my Grandmother special day RIP.",0
5,"these are great. Yes, they do fog up if you are breathing heavily, but so impressed that my employer bought them for my students",1
1,"These earrings are very poorly made... And super heavy... Beware!!! Save your money, even tho they are cheap, and doesn't cost a lot... I've had $1.00 earrings that are a way better quality...",0
4,easy to wear,1
5,"Good material, well made...",1
3,had to purchase additional metal adhesive inserts to try to get a deal to prevent my glasses fogging up... sorta works.. LOVE SRV though..,0
5,Fits great and is very comfortable. Great quality and value.,1
5,Very cute and fits well.,1
3,I order a size medium  it fits just right .......the material is kind of cheap and the bottom part is a thong not an underwear. 🤔🤔🤔,0
3,People might think that I brought it from a $1.99 store,0
5,Ran a little big and had to return it but it was perfect for what it was needed for had it fit.,1
2,They came broke.,0
1,I received my item  and it looks lovely but it did not have the chain in the box. Is it possible you can still get me a chain?,0
4,"Nice shorts, but too small for my body shape. I wear a size 8 so I ordered a large. The shorts were way too small. Pro would be perfect if I ordered an xl.",1
2,"the shirt was really terrible, it didn't close well at the top, and I knew it ran sml, so I ordered the 3 x, and I wear a 16/18 not true to size AT ALL. I didn't like the closure at all it looks decent in the photo, but in fact the top button wont close because of rushing, you have to keep buttoning, and lets not even talk about the wrinkles",0
5,Simply gorgeous!!!!!!!!!,1
5,Love this watch.  Looks and feels very nice!,1
5,This cute little guy is so cute. But I have large hands for a woman and it is a bit of a squeeze to get it on and off. I still enjoy it though and will add my own charms.,1
2,I ordered the black & tan leopard print & the gray leopard print. They were advertised as a cotton poly blend but they're 95% polyester 5% spandex. Not a super flattering fit & a lot of loose threads. The gray leopard print had an almost neon yellow in it. Really ugly. The black & tan was not bad but I can't do the material. Sending both back.,0
5,"I absolutely love these!<br /><br />My BFF and I were on our way to meet her man for lunch when I picked them up from the mailbox. I opened them immediately and we both oohed and aahed. I started to say, 'I got these because I like the two sets as one pair'. All she heard was 'I got these...' and 'knew' the end of my sentence would surely be, '.. for you' - ' I got these for you.' With that, she took them from my fingers and put them on her ears. They looked beautiful on her and I told her so. Beautiful, as if they were hers - were meant to be hers. Not mine. She squeezed me tight,  thanked me, and told me she loved me. 'I know you do,' I said, 'that's why I got these for you.'",1
5,Mom uses it daily.,1
5,Beautiful Dress,1
2,"This dress is super pretty and flattering. Unfortunately, I only got to wear it once. When I tried putting it on a second time the zipper broke. I tried fixing it with a repair kit but could not get it to align again. Very unfortunate and disappointing. Given the price I might buy it again, but not sure the quality would be any better.",0
4,Came somewhat small,1
1,I bought this ring and a week later the painting/coating of the ring came off.,0
2,I didn't like the material of this dress and it was too small/tight,0
1,"Masks smell weird as soon as you take them out of their bags. Smells much stronger when you put them on. The colors aren’t uniform? Seems like two teeth are used and two masks are new, based on color alone. Will try washing them. If smell doesn’t come out I will have to throw them out. Otherwise they fit adult faces and teen faces. Too big for children.",0
5,"I purchased these nose studs after going through tons of other cheap studs. I would find myself constantly having to replace them because they were constantly falling out while washing my face, sleeping, etc. I bought these studs because there are a lot of them in a package and I figured I'd be replacing them frequently as they fall out and get lose. I am happy to say that, even though these studs are low priced, I've had one in for well over a month and it hasn't fallen out! Very pleasantly surprised. They look great too! Very satisfied with this purchase!",1
4,"So pretty, I wish it fit. Beautiful, great quality fabric, but the elastic at waist is too snug. Had to return.",1
1,The zipper is too weak. I went to use the  bathroom and the zipper popped.,0
1,It looks nice but breaks if you put it on,0
5,Very nice,1
5,Perfect for my daughters bracelets crafting!,1
5,Bought as a gift and nephew loved it,1
5,"Love this bag, gotten many compliments.  Would definitely order again.",1
5,Love this dress.  It fit perfect and has pockets.  It was perfect for the trip I went on.,1
3,"The ""horns"" do not stand up.  Reminds me of Domino's noid. Very soft.  Well have to see if I can put wires in it too stand it up",0
1,Yuk! Also it’s super short and VERY see through. You can definitely see the pockets through the outer material.,0
3,They run very small.,0
5,Items arrived in timely fashion and were as described. They fitted our purpose exactly as needed.,1
5,"This is clearly a quality product cause I legit have been wearing them for over a year straight and they are awesome. I sleep, shower, swim and workout in them! They are awesome!",1
5,Comfortable and keeps feet warm in snowy weather. I use it when I have to shovel my car out of the snow!,1
3,Hard to get on,0
4,I just love this sandal!! Its comfortable and love it that it comes in different colors I got the all versatile Black!! Use it with anything.,1
1,Too small sent it back,0
3,Super cute bag but way too small. The bag is about 9”x6” instead of the 13”x9” listed in the description. Seller refunded my money with no problems.,0
3,"I would go up in size if you want a loose fit, also is a little shorter. I got a medium which is what I usually wear, should have gotten a large for a larger fit.",0
1,"Runs very small. Strange design, odd fit, weird length. The material is like swimsuit material. I'm 5'7&#34;, 135 lbs, 36D. I ordered a medium. I generally wear a size 4 in dresses. This fit however the top was stitched strange, the length and drape was weird. I'm returning this dress.",0
1,Too short to wide made for fat person! Size chart inaccurate,0
5,Very good.... excellent,1
5,Love it! Easy to breathe through and it’s comfortable. I’ve received to many compliments on it.,1
5,Great sweater for the price,1
2,wasn't made the same as picture the string is much smaller the color was off,0
5,These on my wife’s favorite capris. She has many other name brands but this is her favorite.,1
2,"The elastic doesn't hold it up very well. When you walk, it falls down.",0
1,Came with a white stain on it looks like its either a dried up boogers or some other dried up crusty  bodily fluid. absolutely disgusting. Will be returning and will not order again,0
1,"Horrible product, disgustingly cheap quality.",0
4,Super soft! My daughter loves it :),1
5,Bold,1
3,"I thought it would look like sterling silver, but it looks cheaper - like something children would buy at the mall.  It also bugs me that the little metal “fringe” part doesn’t lay properly so that they all face one direction. It gets twisted and looks sloppy.",0
5,Its very Beautiful too long I just don't what I'm going to do maybe wear it pulled up to my bra.. Lol the material is So the Colors are vibrant maybe I can have this one taken in..,1
5,Such an elegant slim watch that fits perfect. Lightweight you can barely feel like its on.  Love the black faceand rose gold.,1
5,"These are amazing, I bought four more pairs after I got the first ones in.  So comfortable and cute! Very well made. Also if you are short these are perfect. They hit my leg right above my ankle, usually I have to get all my leggings to the tailor. Great find, highly recommend. Very similar to lulu lemon.",1
5,Bought as a gift for my roommate. We have 12 chickens and she's had so much fun gathering their eggs. Perfect gift! Comes in a super cute bag for gift giving!,1
5,"Received this for Christmas, and I must say, this is one of the coolest presents I have received thus far!  Prefect fit for me. I am 5'4 husky 170lb guy, so the medium was in point. Very comfortable. Even enough for me to keep on and run errands on my weekends or even take me kid to school.",1
5,"I'm 5'6&#34;, and this dress goes to just above my knees.  I ordered a size larger than normal, based on other reviews, and it fits great.  The black dress does not appear to be see-through, and the fabric is soft and comfortable.  I'm considering order other colors.",1
1,Cheap quality,0
3,"The dress was nice, however a bit longer than I wanted so I returned it.",0
1,Ouch.,0
5,Perfect. Gift,1
1,It's super thin and sheer. Definitely not worth the money.,0
5,great walllet insert you can not beat the price,1
5,This necklace lasted me almost 4 years and I'm looking to buy another one just like it. I never took it off (not even in taking a shower) and it still lasted 4 years.,1
2,I ordered this shirt for Christmas and when it came in the mail... it had iron prints on it. Looked like it had been under heat too long...The shirt now has a weird line above the words CREED and it's very noticeable.,0
2,"Fit as expected, just kinda uglier than expected.",0
1,"Very poor fit, quality, and feel.  First one I took out of the plastic had a stain on it, others found to have defects inclusive of ripped pockets, and other abnormalities.  Stay away from these, not worth your aggravation...",0
3,"Not bad for the price but odd sizing.  Very snug in the upper body but too large in the hips.  I am 5’5” and 110 lbs.  the small was too small on top but will try a medium and if it works, take it in on the sides",0
3,It would be super cute if both sides were the same shade of blue but the other side is a solid mismatching shade of blue. It is also smaller than depicted.,0
3,"I was really excited about this Fuzzy 3 Piece Sweatsuit, but I was really disappointed. I order this in an XL and it didn't fit at all, it felt more like a medium.",0
1,The depiction of the photo doesn’t match how it looks. The cross over of the straps makes it look like a racer back in the front. The straps kept sliding down even after tightening and I didn’t like it at all. It was returned.,0
3,"Based on reviews I knew to order a size up. The fit is good, not amazing but it'll do. I think I like the bottom more than I like the top, over it's a good purchase for the price.",0
3,"Looks exactly as pictured. I got a US6 and I'm 5'3&#34;, 130lbs. I'm bigger in the butt and smaller in the breasts so getting it over my hips was a little challenge but once it was over it didn't fit my chest very well. There is some extreme padding in the breast area and it even came with extra, but there's so much that it just looks unnatural on my chest.<br />It also lost most of it's color in the washingmachine, which I'm disappointed about but kind of expected. Overall not bad.",0
1,"They look nice, the detail on them is good. But I wore them for all of a few days and I went to wipe off the usual ear funk that collects on them, I start wiping it lightly and it cracks right in half. After this happened I took a closer look and there were faults and cracks all the way up it.",0
1,"It fit just right however, the wires poked out within a month and I had to throw it away.",0
5,"Super cute. However they are very thin. Bought for 11yo daughter for Christmas, hope they don’t break easy.",1
3,The shirt was nice but for an extra Large the size was too small. I stretched it so it fit ok but not as expected.,0
3,not good value for money!,0
1,I ordered a digital print ACU style military jacket and I received an army drab green military jacket instead,0
3,"These earrings are so cute and they look like the picture.  However, the post on the ear crawler is crooked and I am afraid if I try to straighten it out it will break.  They are dainty and I'm not sure that the quality is very good.  Because the post is crooked, it does not lay quite right on my ear.  I will try to exchange and will update my review if the next pair is better.",0
5,"Fits great, fabric feels like more cotton-y than not, perfect thickness, not sheer, curve hugging, cute little slit and ruching are nice. Could be dressed up but that’s not my plan lol.<br /><br />Oh - the smell is awful initially, very chemical-like, it goes away obviously.",1
3,"I wanted so bad to love Blackskies hats. I tried the Grounded 5-panel first, but the depth was way too big, it ended up going down over my ears. I tried the Obsidian next and the depth was perfect, but it was way too small. Even on the largest hole on the closure it was squeezing my head. There's no way I'd be able to wear it without a getting a headache. Three stars for me. Great looking hat, well made, but just not the right fit for my head.",0
5,"Shipping took longer than expected but I don’t believe it was the seller’s fault, it’s a great gift idea and worth the scratch!",1
5,Provides a different look then the band that came with my Apple Watch. The perforation allows for better breathing during physical activity.,1
5,The bracelets were in perfect shape and the seller sent a written personal thank you on the order sheet. I’d buy from them again :),1
4,"Wore this to a wedding. Very nice fit. Hot an XL I'm 190. The zipper is my only complaint about this dress. It is small and very hard to zip up and down.  Other than that. The pattern, and look is what I expected from the pictures. Also for girl like me that have a bit of a belly, the fit to flare is not where expected so it is up higher so if you dont wear shapewear you will look like you are expecting lol. But all and all a good buy",1
2,"Beautiful but cheaply made, the posts came bent now the bend easily even as you are wearing them.",0
2,I usually wear a medium so I order a large thinking it would be lose not so...if ordering order two sizes up...cute and correct color but not happy with the size!,0
4,Super cute. I’d wear a tank underneath bc you can kind of see bra underneath. But fits as I expected it to. Cute and comfy!,1
5,"We originally bought these to keep in our trunk for grocery bag control, but after awhile we were like why don’t we just use these by themselves? And after one round of easy loading in the self check out lane, we’re never going back to bags!",1
5,Loved it! A gift for a friend since kindergarten! 👍 ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,1
2,"I had high hopes for these shorts.  I purchased a pair for my teenage son because they're Seahawks colors and we're fans.  They're so short!  They come up to mid-thigh...he much prefers shorts than hang right above the knee.  Even worse, after we washed them according to the tag instructions, they seemed to shrink and look rather wrinkly and wadded up.<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't recommend these.",0
5,Normally I wear an XL. Read the sizing charts and sized up to an XXL. Fits great. Light soft material. Good buy,1
5,Great quality - worth the money. Perfect size; and all the pockets/slots were just right.,1
2,"Cute dress, not worth $20. Makes me think of something from Melrose. Should be closer to $10",0
5,La longitud del pantalón es la adecuada y ceñido en la cintura,1
5,"Just received them yesterday, very pretty and delicate earrings.",1
4,Nice boots for Undyne cosplay,1
1,This is crap do not buy turned my finger green,0
3,"The brim could be a little wider. Also, they are made for smaller children 8 and younger.",0
1,IT'S PLASTIC!!,0
5,"I recently had a melanoma removed from my leg which resulted in a 4 inch incision on my lower leg.  My doctor told me to wear compression socks/sleeves to help the healing process.  Of course, in my mind I thought ""No way, those are for old people""  But I ordered these and absolutely love them  2 weeks post op and my leg is healing quickly and looks great.  The sleeves are comfortable, no binding.  I have ordered 3 more pair and plan to keep them in my daily routine.  I wear them on my off leg as well, and it's amazing how good I feel.  I have very large calves(17"") and the XL fit perfect.",1
1,Do not fit adult ears without cutting.,0
5,"True to size. Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. She loves it.",1
3,Tool to adjust the watch band is made poorly and would not assist in the adjustment process.,0
1,theyre durable but they slide right off my head so they're useless for ME. They have the grippy rubber band around the inside but it doesnt work. Idk if my hair is too conditioned or maybe its too big for my head.,0
5,It was a gift.  I really liked it and so did the person I gave it to.,1
5,"The granddaughter loves it, and never wants to take it off. Runs around the house pretending to be a princess.<br /><br />It's very cute, and a great addition to play time/story time/dressup time. Lots of fun!",1
3,This sweater is acrylic as opposed to a soft cotton blend. It fits kind of tight in the arms as well. I don't like it simply because of the material it's made out of. It's 95% rayon and 5% spandex. Reminds me of the pants I used to wear in the 80s! Lol It's kind of hot when wearing it too because of the material. It's OK but I won't be wearing it as often as I hoped to.,0
5,Excellent leather tags.<br />Superior quality.<br />I am so glad i bought extra. Love the colors!!!!,1
5,"This blouse is GORGEOUS! Bought the navy blue in medium. Accurate sizing, beautiful design, length hangs just below the butt in back, slightly shorter in front. I liked that I could freely go about my business bending over and moving with no restriction or neckline hanging so low that people could see down my shirt. I'm 5'8&#34;, 154# normally wear a size 10 or medium for reference. This is the second style of this brand I've purchased. Both are great quality and cut. Highly recommend.",1
2,"I am a personal trainer and I give these pants a 2/5. These shorts were very stretchy and the fabric was interesting. I would recommend wearing them possibly for a light workout. They do not seem like they have good wicking/air flow. so maybe not the best for an intense workout. The fabric might be acceptable for you but for me did not seem breathable. Yoga or mobility. I will say - they run big. They were huge actually and that is something to note. Order smaller if you want the right size.  They also coiled up around the tops of my legs and caused ridging, lots of looseness in the legs but tight in the top. These shorts do not have any retention and will ride up during your workout.",0
1,"I opened the package of this squid, and immediately though I walked into a nail polish factory where someone had spilled a raw batch of chemicals all over the floor. The stuff is INEDIBLE. Package says it expires in 2023, but I doubt that it's any good as is.<br /><br />I, very stupidly, tried to tough through it and eat some anyway and of course puked it up right away and have felt like puking all day since.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Spend the extra few bucks for a different brand. Never had a problem with dried squid like I have with this brand. Serves me right for being cheap.<br /><br />P.S: I bought two packs, both had the issue despite expiring at vastly different times, so it seems its not a one shot issue as well.",0
5,I love this swimsuit. Purchase according to size chart.  I don't think this will fit larger breast sizes.  I am a 36C and the XL fit pefect,1
1,Not what I excepted but I  guess you get what you pay for!,0
5,The band was wonderful quality and it included the tools necessary to attach the band.  I would highly recommend it!,1
1,"Came late, and too small. I wear 12/14 and xxl to small. Bra would probably fit a c cup.",0
5,"Beautiful, bought for my grandma and she absolutely loves it !",1
5,I absolutely love these compression socks!  They are very comfortable and make my legs feel so much better!  I have had several ankle problems and wearing these compression socks gives me the added support I need.  I highly recommend them!,1
2,The hat is not Distressed or Vintage as described. It is brand new with Velcro not snap size adjustments,0
1,Way too big.. Had to return it,0
1,"the sizes are wrong, very high waist and the quality is lousy, I have not a month with them and the elastic is already worn.",0
1,Very cheap but you get what u paid for,0
5,Just as described! Love the earrings and the packaging is super cute!,1
5,As advertises. Fits perfectly on my GW 2500.,1
1,The material of the dress is nothing like the picture. The dress looks like a cheap night gown to sleep in,0
5,"I LOVE THESE EARRINGS!<br />They're adorable,the size and color are perfect,and the material is good quality;they don't look cheap at all!",1
1,"I thought I was ordering a 95% cotton shirt.  Turns out, it is only 60% cotton.  The description is wrong, wrong.",0
1,all the leafs broke off,0
1,Very bad blouse and provided. I received the product in poor condition and dirty. I definitely do not recommend it,0
5,Great product and fast shipping,1
5,"Love this dress. Bought a large,  I'm 5'6 170<br />Fits great 😊",1
2,"The watch itself tells time, so I suppose it performs its function, but the overall look was less polished than I'd hoped.  Considering how cheap it is, it's not entirely unexpected, but all of the secondary dials and buttons are for show only.  It looked relatively good on, but the quality was apparent.  Looks better in the picture than it does on my hand.  The &#34;leather&#34; strap (I'm not convinced of its genuineness) was itchy and cut a bit rough on the edges, not comfortable to wear if you plan on bending your wrist much.",0
1,It came with the lenses popped out and were damaged as I tried to put them in. They kept on popping out and are now scratched beyond usa after a camping trip.,0
5,Super nice boots originally bought a different maker spend $35 these were purchased for half that price and they're awesome,1
5,So far so good.  Really cute on and comfortable.  It has a stretch to it.,1
3,Not the color in the picture its a darker duller blue ordered a size larger per suggestion of other reviews I read... shouldn't have. Other wise its a nice shirt for the money,0
5,Gorgeous,1
4,"My 7 year old son loves these pants. He gets excited any time he sees the Kid Nation logo. I don't think he's been disappointed yet with anything he's got from them. These pants are soft and comfortable for him. He loves that they have pockets. Once I get these clean and back in his drawer, it's pretty much guaranteed that he'll grab them to wear, even though it's hot outside. He likes to protect his legs from thorns and mosquitos, though, while he's exploring.<br /><br />This probably doesn't have to be said, but if you get the color red, like us, you will want to wash them separate from other clothes at least a few times, unless you want them pink. The color does fade pretty quickly.",1
1,"Print and weight is good, but a women’s large is really a kids size 12. Also a bit short.",0
1,Runs small,0
3,"The shirt is ok a far as quality goes.  What I don't care for is the fact that the sleeves are made of several different pieces of material rather than just once piece with different colors.  Also, the collar is very small but it pretty much shows that in the pictures.",0
5,This necklace is stunning. I love it. What more can I say? The quality is excellent.,1
3,one of the necklaces came detached... had to reattach on another link.,0
4,Great shoes. My daughter loves them and says they are very comfortable and work for exactly what she needs them for at school.,1
3,This is a women's watch - quite small. Gave to my wife.,0
5,It fit perfectly and the material is strong,1
4,"Love them, so far no issues. They are comfortable and the lenses change out easily.",1
1,Do not buy these.  Bandanas are falling apart after 1 wash.  The designs are painted on and are flaking off after first wash as well.  Absolute crap.,0
5,Great earrings and price to boot.,1
5,Beautiful colors and quality appears good.,1
5,I personally really like the shirt it's a little loose in the front and rises up when walking but if you wear it with high waisted pants you will be fine.,1
3,Way too thick and bulky. The leather felt like plastic.,0
3,"Nice style and piece, haven't seen anything like this, but not as shiny as I would have wished for the red - which is an enamel finish, as is the green.  However, it still looks nice and is a pretty addition at the holidays.",0
5,"Loved everything about it! Great designs, great quality and fit my kiddos perfectly",1
4,Super cute and good quality.,1
5,It’s very pretty. I bought this for my friend who was having a baby in August. We made a birthing necklace for her and she loved it. It is small but I was kind of expecting that. It’s just hard to know the size from the pictures,1
4,I like it. I have curly hair so I enjoy the extra room to get my thick hair through. Pretty awesome.,1
1,Cheap AF<br />Doesn’t stay on unless held in place,0
5,Have not tried it on yet but love the color,1
5,My granddaughter love it.,1
2,"The body was the correct size, the arms were at least 2 sizes too small for me. (My arms are not out of proportion to my body). The top button immediately fell off as I tried the coat on. The coat did not look nearly as good as the photos-- though the body material was nice.",0
5,jewelry,1
5,"The color was what really stood out. Loved the gold and black. Perfect for our photo shoot. And for the price, simply a great value",1
5,Fits just like it should and love the look!,1
5,I ordered these for my daughter and the quality is amazing. They are thick and also soft and comfy. We are impressed and will be ordering again when ready to size up.,1
3,"The wallet is slim, compact and fits easily in a small clutch. It’s too large for the pockets on my pants. I’m not sure if the RFID blocking works though because my work badge still works when I put it in the wallet and tap the card reader. Also, I don’t know if it protects all the cards, even the ones on the outside, or just the ones on the inside. This item isn’t accompanied by a description or explanation of how the wallet blocks RFID.<br /><br /> I put a few coins in the coin pocket, and the wallet would no longer snap. It will snap if the coins are in a single layer. You can put a couple of bills on the inside part. There isn’t a pocket for bills, just fold them and place inside and fasten the snap.",0
1,"Just walking the dog and its not raining, just the water on the pavement, the shoes really deformed, and whithin a few days the outsole of the shoes detached<br />Shoe its not leather, material becomes smelly",0
1,This weather is terrible I don't recommend anybody to buy it .it was damaged two times the same item,0
5,"We purchased this set for Father's day gifts.  This will allow both children to customize the apron for daddy.  Daddy recently received a new built in BBQ and he's taking to grilling quite seriously.  Kids are always wondering what to give dad on Father's day... Well I don't know of any guys that won't wear denim, so here is a heavy duty dark colored denim (to hide those grease and condiment stains) that all men (and ladies) can enjoy.<br /><br />This apron pretty much looks exactly like the photo, couldn't snap any pix of daddy in it, this would ruin the surprise.  LOL<br /><br />It arrived quickly and in great condition.

1,The fit was too loose and the neckline too plunging,0
1,Doesn't fit normal.<br />Missed return deadline and I am the loser now.<br />Will know to stay away in the future,0
5,Cumplio con todas las espectativas,1
3,Definitely too small,0
1,Didn't fit,0
2,"Not as shown. Only little ""tit"" bumps<br />Kinda cute. Fits adult heads",0
2,they were very small. I bought a size for my husband and when it came it would fit a med. child.  It was supposed to be for men. The size was way off.,0
5,They were just fine.,1
1,Sides of shoes fell apart and lights stopped working after only a few wears.,0
5,Cute dress,1
5,Well these are great little earrings.  Nice sized and light weight so they don't tug at your ear at all.,1
2,"If youre a spiritualist, this had bad energy. The company I worked for laid off and closed all 9 of us in the import department a week after got this necklace. It felt weird when I opened it. I would not recommend, I think it's stolen stone and it's karma will bite you.",0
1,"The size is on the small side, the fabric is like a satin taffeta, not usual slip material. It clings and is static-y -defeats the purpose of using it as a slip. Would not buy again.",0
3,There's not much fabric to this piece as advertised in the photo. In agreement with other reviewers that this is very small and therefore pricey,0
2,Looked good in pictures. Easy to read and nice long necklace. Construction poor. Back kept falling off in normal wear.,0
5,"The perfect dress to Disney Bound as Princess Rapunzel! I love this dress! It’s so comfortable, it’s gorgeous and the color is stunning! I got so many compliments on it at Disney. I’m looking forward to finding more ways to wear it!",1
5,Seems to be good quality like the look of those shirts,1
5,Love them,1
3,No to the true fit,0
3,But thinner material than expected but pretty and soft as description suggested.,0
5,"My husband had a Russell Athletic Sweatshirt and Sweatpants for over 10 years and needed a new set.  Had to order from three different Amazon vendors to get two sets, one black, one navy blue.  My husband loves them.  Hopefully, he'll be happy for another 10 years.",1
5,I really liked the apron. It is good qua!ity and the colors are vibrant and appear not to fade.,1
5,Nice hat. Love the long duck bill.,1
1,This dress is made of really thin jersey knit. Not suitable for a special occasion.,0
5,Comfortable and pretty.,1
5,Bought it for my son. He said he likes it,1
1,"Not what I expected, probably won't wear",0
1,"These sports bras have too much variation in sizing. All three of these bras pictured are the same labeled size. I’ve returned a total of three bras now because of the sizing variations.<br />Bra 1 is perfect (pictured #2)<br />Bra 2 is perfect (pictured #1)<br />Bra 3 is too large<br />Bra 4 is too small<br />Bra 5 is too large (pictured; #3)<br /><br />3 out of 5 (60%) bras being returned shows poor product quality control.<br />It’s disappointing because they’re good bras, if only you’d receive the size you ordered.",0
1,Thin material and runs super small. Can't even wear it. Gave it away,0
3,shrank over 6 inches at the hem after first wash but very soft,0
2,Other than one lens being distorted with an uneven finish the lens are not bad.,0
1,They are cool looking BUT not sunglasses. No shade what so ever.,0
2,Don't like at all. I wear medium and these were too small.,0
1,The color is not even close to the picture. In fact the shirt has 2 completely different colors that don't even look good together. I would not buy this shirt!,0
5,Liked the fit - semi professional,1
5,Beautifully done,1
5,My husband loves this belt. After the first bought another,1
5,Good quality! I go between medium and large (I wear a size 10 Jean) and I'm glad I ordered a large here. They are very snug but I think that's good just in case they wear down.,1
3,It was a gift.,0
5,"I needed this dress for a Polo event wear the dress code was Kentucky Derby!  I really liked the dress but have to admit was nit really sure about how it would look on me.  However, dress came within 2 days.  The material is stretchy.  I believe it was well made all around.  It was extremely flattering to someone who holds most of my weight in my stomach area.  I believed the dress was very slimming and all around it felt extremely comfortable to be in.  I got many complaints!  I think I got the assignment!  Would definitely buy again!!! And, price was great!!!<br /><br />5’9, 260, Note:  I followed the sizing chart for my bra size 48.  Had I not carried weight in stomach, I would have gotten a size smaller.  Hope this helps!!!",1
4,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 105 lbs, 34c chest, 27 waist, 34 hip and small fit great. I'm typically a U.S. size 4.  I deducted 1 star due to its thin material. I cant say its see through, but it could be thicker. Nice material for hot weather! And the &#34;yellow color&#34; was not yellow, but goldish/brown. Just a super weird color, but I'm going to return it and get another color due to the overall fit, cuteness and quality! Exactly as pictured(even yellow) and described. Hope it helps :)",1
5,The band is too small and extension is needed for me however it is an insanely effective bra. I mean. Wow!,1
1,Very cheaply made bras.  The bras made my breast look more rectangular than round.  I wore them a couple of times and eventually threw them into the garbage.,0
2,I washed the shirt before my son wore it and I turned it inside out.  When I retrieved it from the dryer the graphic was stuck to the inside of the shirt. I had to let the shirt cool completely before turning the shirt right side out.  After washing the graphic looked extremely dingy as if he had worn the shirt many times.... I would not recommend this vendor especially for the price,0
5,"It’s a really nice shirt for the holidays! Love it, and I received it before Christmas!",1
5,Hermoso vestido,1
5,"I love these shirts to spice up other tanks as I put them underneath.  I also use these under long sleeve shirts to give the outfit a little extra flair.  I typically wear XL or 2X and these run kind of small.  I purchased a 2X and my only compliance is that I have to keep pulling them down as they are a slick material.  Had I purchased the next size up, they would have been perfect!!",1
1,"These costumes are very cheaply made & already have holes after being washed just once. I would not purchase them again. Unfortunately I purchased two, and expected better quality.",0
3,La falda me gustó su tela y es muy linda pero tuve que meterle en las caderas y además moverles todos los botones por que quedaba muy grande.,0
4,She loves the material but I did have to go a size bigger didn’t feel it was true to size,1
2,"I loved this and thought it was super cute. However, I didn't even get to wear it. Took it out of the package and there was already a huge hole in the arm seam. Guess I should have looked at previous reviews, looks like this is pretty common. Will be returning this!",0
2,"This swim suit is gorgeous but it is several sizes too small. If you want to order, I suggest going 3-4 sizes up.",0
5,Super cute socks! Perfect for my friend!,1
1,Can't get over chest size is right material is not flexible,0
5,Nice fit and I love the liner. Plenty of pocket space and nicely priced.,1
5,"Got it right away, been wearing it ever since!",1
5,love this watch. clean. stylish. very affordable.,1
1,These are flimsy and not the color advertised,0
5,Very comfortable! True to size. The only thing I would complain about are that the rubber grippers fall off very easily.,1
5,Great,1
4,"I previously purchased the Japanese national team's jerseys in the Japanese sizes, and their S,M,L,XL sizes are different from those of the US sizes, so please be aware of what you're buying and from where. (The US M is inches longer and more roomy for a man typically of US M size than the Japan M)<br /><br />Overall, the shirt is very good quality. The fabric is thick, the colors are bright, and it has not shrunken in the dryer so far, although I generally hang and air dry the shirt to protect it. The shirt is authentic. Recommend.",1
3,Very tiny. Very noisy.,0
1,This ring honestly does not look like the picture at all and the&#34;silver&#34; looks like a rusty black. It's terrible 😕,0
3,Did not do what i expected.,0
1,I did not like how ruffles looked. If there wasn't any ruffles would have worked out just fine!,0
1,"Wish I could give this zero stars. So disappointed. Got this shirt because it is described and pictured as a wrap shirt, but it is not. I was scammed. These images that I took clearly show how it is a completely different shirt than in the picture. Do not advertise as a wrap shirt and use fake images if it is not actually a wrapped style shirt. Returning!",0
2,"Unless you have the enormous face of King Long, these clip on's are far too large.  Additionally, the clip is hard to put on without using both hands and even removing my glasses to fit them on properly.  I'll return these.",0
5,This watch is dressy enough it looks like a piece of jewelry.  Love.,1
5,"The bracelets are just beautiful, very stylish and good quality. Their sizes seem to vary a bit but not an issue at all. Love wearing them!",1
5,"Great way to kick off my  month long birthday celebrations! Nice fabric in  beautiful bright red. Stripes keep it youthful  and on trend. Can be worn with causal skirts, shorts,  jeans or slacks.",1
2,These frayed and broke on my first trip using them,0
1,"Goggles were too big, left too much space between the foam and the skin. Items were returned.",0
5,This is the second one that I have bought.  Nice color!,1
5,Nice ***** I love it 🥰,1
5,Beautiful and durable. Love them!,1
1,The one I received is Red not Purpie,0
5,Looks as expected,1
4,"WIth the large mix of reviews, I was curious as to how this product will serve me. I bought the green one. It turned out to be almost the exact color as on my screen.<br /><br />SIZE: It fit my iPhone 6 (not the plus) just fine. I use a men's walle that is about half an inch thickt. Both my phone and my wallet fit just fine, but it is a little tight. With both of those I only barely have room for a chapstick. I have a hard time fitting my keys. There is NO way a pocket book could fit in there.<br /><br />The shoulder strap was fine for me, but I am 5'3.<br /><br />QUALITY: I'd say the quality is what I expected for a purse under $10",1
3,This is a cute dress but it's a little big.....wish I would have ordered a medium,0
3,Cool looking watch,0
5,"I love it; it fits perfect, is long enough for my long torso and is comfortable.  The saying is so cute.  I love to wear it hiking!",1
5,This is my second one in a different color....such a cool item and very durable.... color is more pink than red,1
2,"These are cute, yes, but the antler placement makes it look like it’s coming straight out of your nose.",0
4,Really pretty and colorful,1
3,"The Tshirt is fine as an item.  I ordered the large, however it seems like a medium.  I guess I should have ordered extra large.",0
4,"Great case to store the remote key fob. I wish the sides were hardened and it did not squished down. The reason I got it was to keep the remote buttons from getting pressed in my pocket but since it is a soft case they can still get pressed easily.  So I found pieces of metal and bent it to support the inside of the case and make a inner shell and works better now.<br />  There also was no way to remove the huge buckle on the side so I had to cut it off which was a shame since there is no way to just temporarily remove/unclip it.<br /><br />Been using it for a few months now and works great, very durable.",1
2,Makes you think you are buying 3 pair but it is only 1.  Not a good fit.,0
5,"Has been hard to find flannel robes for my mom. I thought at first this was thin fabric, but washed to make sure sizing was out, used liquid fabric softener and it felt great. She loves it.",1
4,Great with leggings!<br />Washes well,1
5,"Just ordered more. We have to wear masks at the gym now and these are amazing. Light, breathable, don’t pull on my ears and hurt. I can work out and breathe (well enough). Fit me perfect, I’m an adult woman but they’re too small for my boyfriend.",1
5,I love this set. It goes with so much!,1
5,!! Articulo muy bonito y de excelente calidad !! colores muy llamativos !! materiales y corte de excelente calidad !!,1
3,Ran pretty small,0
5,"My 11-year-old daughter was so happy to receive this for Christmas. We had been looking at fox fur  animal hoods that were really expensive elsewhere, naturally the price point was a no brainer once we found this gem!",1
5,Works great!,1
1,Band did not have screw mount installed in the band so when I went to hit some balls with my GPS watch the band came lose.,0
1,The ones that came were nothing like the picture. Very disappointed wanted a certain style,0
1,Sleeves are very short .,0
1,hate it and cheap,0
5,I adore this dress! I ordered a med and it fit like a glove.  Im 5'4 130 lbs... Hippy but no boobs :( Warm and cozy midi dress... Exactly as pictured. A light blue/grey color. The fabric is similar to sweatshirt material. Wish it came in other colors... Id order them all. My only complaint is the collar wont stay down right... But a couple safety pins solves that.,1
5,Accurate,1
1,The ink in this bled all over my pillow cases and stained them.,0
4,I like the look and style of these glasses. The plastic frame feels a bit on the fragile side though. It's been only a week so time will tell.,1
5,"Love love love this. I've worn it with a skinny top under, but prefer it with an open-front cardigan for work. At 5' the bottom of the dress just brushes the top of my feet. The construction seems good - I didn't have any open hems or such. I like the material and the colors, and haven't had the problems with the color bleeding that some others had mentioned. Super comfy and it makes me feel pretty. The perfect sort of online purchase!!",1
5,as advertised,1
3,"XXL but still fits tight, I normally feel comfortable in 1X sizes",0
1,Did not like how this material was when I got it.  Definitely looks more like a clown suit.  Going to try and save it by dyeing it but not holding my breath,0
1,"The material is quite inexpensive feeling and the size is very, very small compared to what it should be. It will barely go on...",0
4,"Used it in Paris, and loved it, kept all my documents, passport, maps, pens and money safe and near and in plain sight near me. Back in the States it hasn't gotten much wear. Nothing wrong with the bag, perhaps just a cultural thing?",1
4,its pretty cute not amazing quality but not bad!,1
5,very good,1
2,Boob portion fit but the body was so long,0
2,"Very cheap , mask is small and broke instantly",0
3,"As with most things, it looks better in the picture than it does in person. That said, it works well enough. Paired with some paisley leggings and it is cute enough, and super comfortable.",0
5,This top is super cute and soft. It washes very well and does not fade. I have two different colors and considering more.,1
1,This item is a 2pk. I only received one.,0
5,Very nice,1
1,Awful! I ordered size small and even like that it didn't fit well! I am always S in dresses but this in particular doesn't look well,0
1,Beautiful stones but I bought 3 for Christmas gifts and the clasp on everyone of them broke. I am not able to return the gifts but new chains are needed. Poor gift item,0
1,"This is one of the most frustrating buys I've ever done. The ring got here on time, the problem is that the size doesn't fit. Before I bought the product I went to a jewelry store and had my fingers measured, it was a size 12. I read some reviews that actually said the ring tended to be a bit bigger than normal, so I went ahead and took the size 12 thinking it would be a good fit and TADA... it's smaller. My problem know is that my wedding is around the corner and I don't have a ring. I feel cheated and abused !!! This was an awful buy.",0
5,Love these.  I bought them for driving at night because other drivers leave their high beams on or they have those LED's that blind you.  These glasses knock down the glare and they are comfortable.  Working the shift has now become safer.,1
5,my mother loved it,1
5,Feel great. Keep me nice and warm and feel so soft n fuzzy,1
1,So cute but the fit is terrible! The cups barely cover your chest. Torso is so short it seems made wrong.,0
3,Didnt like shape or color,0
5,I love the necklace but one of the earrings is broken.  How can  I exchange it?  I really love the necklace set and would like to find it in different colors.,1
5,"Super sparkly, I was afraid they would be cheap looking but despite the fact that they are comfortably light they sparkle and seem very sturdy, good size too.",1
5,"I absolutely love this hoodie!! With the logo on the front and the adorable chibi characters on the back, I can't wait for the cold weather to get here!! My daughter and I are huge ARMY people and will be sharing/fighting over this all winter!!",1

4,nice for the price,1
5,should have ordered 2 for a match,1
5,Excelente,1
3,"Is it worth $10+? Yes. Is it worth more? Not much. The green color was way off from the picture, very dark.  The hardware is cheap of course, and the band won't be as durable as a brand name. It is a decent band and for the price you could buy a lot of them and still come in under what you would pay for a brand name. This a decent option.",0
5,Looks and fells good!. Good enough for the price.,1
4,The top is a little heavy and itchy. But other then that a cute dress.,1
5,I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter who loves unicorns. She thinks passing gas is hysterical so the the picture of this unicorn “blasting” off was a great gift. She laughed so hard. The night gown fit as expected and is soft.,1
5,Love the hat and I get lots on compliments but the only thing I dislike is that it’s super long on my forehead.,1
4,Received in a timely manner and are very comfortable.,1
5,"Good material, excellent work",1
2,Toooo small,0
3,"Smaller than I thought it would be and I have a short torso, no real stretch to this material. It looks nice but I would’ve been better off going a size up!",0
1,Poor quality - zipper broke in less than a week. Relaxed it and the new one did the same thing,0
5,"Honestly, I've paid $50+ for belts that have a similar look and feel. It's good quality and I am happy with the purchase.<br /><br />I actually got my girlfriend because of this belt. I was walking down the street and caught her looking down at my crouch regain. So I said to this random woman, &#34;Hey toots, my eyes are up here.&#34; She confirmed she wasn't checking out my &#34;package&#34; and that she was impressed by the belt.<br /><br />Thanks Men's Black Leather Belt by Vellette. Keeping it real!",1
4,Very good product,1
3,"Band fit fine and looks good, but the clasp is extremely tight. Wife was unable to open it while it was on her wrist. We decided to order a magnet-clasp style band which she is much happier with. Fits the Samsung Gear S2 (42mm version, not 3G).",0
5,Hermoso,1

5,"LOVE these tops! I am a 34DD, 27in waist, got the extra small and they are a perfect fit. Not skin tight but not too loose with the dreaded hang off the boobs look pregnant look. New fav workout top!",1
2,Poor quality shirts.  Button color bled onto the shirt after the 1st wash.  Also the white lines on the shirt started coming off after 1 wash. The yellow Coofandy shirt also lost the lines after the 1st wash.  Pictures of the purple attached.,0
5,I’m a big fan of Alex and Ani bracelets. I purchased this one for my daughter-in-law who recently moved to an area that is known for fresh lobsters. The bracelet arrived on time and was boxed beautifully.,1
5,It is wonderful! A little heavy but awesome,1
3,"I have another pair of Just USA Jeans that I love, so I wanted to try another style.  These didn't fit quite right for me so I had to return them.  The color and feel was nice otherwise.  Just didn't fit as well as other Just USA styles on me.  Order a size up if in question about which size to choose.",0
5,"this band was for my wife she loves it,",1
4,These are great! Only 4 stars because the O-rings could be a little bigger so they dont fall off with idle play. But I replaced them with thicker ones so its not an issue anymore. I even bought a pair for my husband because he was envious of mine.,1
5,Very nice quality and nice necklace to go with the heart charm. Bought for wife and she was happy.,1
5,I think they have limited application but may help with some tasks,1
2,2 stars for the packaging everything else about these is garbage lasted 2 weeks before breaking without any stress,0
3,Bad plastic,0
5,It's sexy,1
4,"They fit and breathe well. Ran with them on for hours and when I took them off, no itch or rash marks that I have gotten in the past.",1
4,"I was a little disappointed that the bag is smaller than expected. The gift boxes carried in the bag are standard clothing size, and they are much taller than the handles can reach, so we had to carry the bag like a football. Otherwise, it is sturdy and the color looks good.",1
5,"I like everything about this watch.  Killer looks, accurate time, comfortable band, reasonable price for what you get!",1
5,These totally cover my torn ear lobe and very comfortable.,1
4,Cleans very good and comes with nice packaging,1
1,Not so great. Really only 1 time use. Quality is realy bad. Tends to strecth at each ends.,0
4,The dress was a bit too long for me but that is an easy fix,1
1,Shorts that were received were labeled 2XL but were clearly not.  They were between an adult medium and large.  Nice shorts for the price but poorly labeled for size.  Had to return for refund.,0
2,"True to size however they get dirty and worn down very easily and quickly. Would only be best for “in the  house” slippers only (at best). Unfortunately, because they were worn down and horribly dirty after 1 use I didn’t feel comfortable returning them.",0
5,"My partner loved them. They are very warm, soft and silly/fun to look at. My partner has size 11/11.5 feet and they fit snug but comfortably.",1
5,I like the look even though I wear few of these pull overs.,1
1,go up 2 sizes,0
2,"I got the black one, runs on the bigger side.. Looks made of cheap material. Shirt is cute, but not worth the price. Half of the price would be a reasonable price for the quality",0
3,"It runs WAY small. I ordered 4 sizes up and STILL was disappointed. It spoiled my Halloween. I'm glad I didn't purchase other items to complete the outfit. I would return but packaging was already disposed of, so...<br /><br />Fabric wise it seemed to be a good quality. Definitely looked as displayed. Just wished I could've worn it.",0
2,"Nice size, but strap broke a month after wearing.",0
4,It’s ok looking! It’s durable! Fits true to size!,1
3,"The fabric and print were great, but I couldn't wear it at the length it comes in.  I'm 5'8""  and of a certain age, and most of my height is in my legs, so it looked sort of ridiculous on me.  I returned it, and I really wanted to like this dress, too.  Great for shorter women.",0
1,I bought one of these and it worked once.  I could not get it to work again.  I returned it and got a replacement.  The replacement had a defective male USB plug and would not work.  After trying 2 that were defective I decided to give up on them.,0
3,"They are pretty,  but very small.  Size was not given in description,  so I judged size by earring in model's ear and it looked bigger than actual size.",0
5,Fabric is soft and not see through. Like that the straps are adjustable.,1
4,Fits a little small but overall it’s ok.,1
2,"Fell apart about 2 hours into light use. Had to throw out because I was already out, or I would’ve sent back for a refund. Disappointed but was cute for a bit.",0
5,"True to size , super soft and comfortable.  Can wear around the house and for sleep",1
5,It's very cute. I had the purse too. So looks nice together . The wallet closes nicely. And not over sized. Thx,1
5,nice quality my kid loved it defiantly recommend,1
1,Purchased this shirt. It runs super small. Is not the same type of shirt pictured. Unable to roll sleeves,0
3,"The reason I thought this top is due to my skin condition where an elastic band of a bra causes heat blisters.  Although a flattering top and made of a nice material, the built in bra strap is not encased in the fabric but rather bare to touch the skin inside. I had to return.",0
5,Really pretty earrings. Love this color.,1
3,Good idea but hard to get kids to keep on their face to cover nose/mouth,0
3,"The price is right for a tie my fiance will only wear once.  The silk was somewhat cheap feeling, and color was not as vibrant as online (the compouter settings could be a factor, though).  Ok purchase.",0
5,"I love this bralette. It looks so cute under v necks or button up shirts. I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone. It looks like the picture, fits great, the material is nice, and the quality is nice as well. I am very happy with this purchase.",1
3,Me quedo reducida pero es buena,0
5,"If you're looking for a solid pair of flops, then be sure to check out these from Utenag. Made (almost) entirely of rubber (except for the inner lining of the straps) so you can use around (or in) water, in the yard, at the beach, etc.. They are also form fitted to your arch. So you will have some decent support. Very squishy! And once broken in they will be super comfortable to wear for long periods. If I have to make one suggestion (as other reviewers pointed out) it would be to GO DOWN ONE SHOE SIZE. Other than that, a very nice pair of flip flops!",1
1,Sizing is way off.  Small was more like a medium/large,0
3,Quality seemed ok but it was huuuuuuge! I wear XL for everything and I like clothes loose but this was ridiculous. I could have fit 2 of me inside. The legs were about a foot too long. Returned item.,0
5,"The sleeves are super long, which is a plus for me because sleeves are normally short on me. The shirt fits a little tighter than other shirts that size, but not too much. Comfy",1
5,"Beautiful colors, great material. Love the quality! Love this dress, and plan to buy others like it!",1
5,My son wore this tie to his prom and he looked great!,1
1,"Fabric fraying, all different sizes and fabrics. Bad quality.",0
2,not for wide foot,0
5,I've always been satisfied with Russell Athletics and I like the somewhat large fir.,1
5,I wear a size 8 and usually wear a medium (5&#34;5) in yoga pants. I'm glad I went for the large after reading the comments. They are great for running.,1
3,"There ok, do what up expect as my pants do stay up ! Fit well but material could feel better.",0
4,My son-in-law liked it,1
1,The quality matches the opinion on this. It’s Chinese made garbage.<br /><br />Amazon should do a better job of keeping these trash products under control.,0
1,I liked it but its a little different from the pic. I thought it as really wide leg.. But it is a nice trouser.. Thanks,0
5,👍,1
1,I will be returning the T-shirt,0
1,Thought I was buying 3 got one ! I should have read the reviews ! Not the only one who thought this ☹️,0
5,Vionic comfort with a bit of style and support all around for my 'older' feet.,1
5,"The green Birthday Girl shirt is cute and soft. A nice women’s fit and true to size but a little long for me. I am only 5’2” though, and everything is long on me.  I hope it will shrink a tad when I wash it.",1
4,Great shirt - was different material than expected,1
1,"loved the look of this shirt, but when i received it, it was way way way to big. i ordered a medium and it fit like it was an xxl",0
3,I wear a large... well I thought if I ordered a<br />x large it was going to be perfect.. well it was too big.. i have to roll the sleeves up bc there’s so much extra material..I could’ve got a large and it would fit perfect.,0
3,Very short for being 5’5. Had to return.,0
1,The size is wrong. Don't buy It.,0
2,"I got double of most of these rings, which was nice; however, after just 1 hour of wear, it turned my finger green. Do not recommend it unless you're using it for costume jewelry. They look really cool; just disappointed in the quality. I'll probably try that trick where you put clear nail polish on the ring to create a barrier.",0
2,Looked more gold than rose gold in person. Which was disappointing.,0
4,"Interesting construction. It's definitely a statement piece, so wearing this with a plain top is best.",1
1,"I am 5'4, about a size 6-8 and size 34C bust. The neck on this dress is high and it makes me look HUGE from the bust to the waist. the length hits below the knee, so it just makes me look short and fat.",0
4,Cute but doesn’t last long,1
1,Broke the first day. Pendant is cute however.,0
1,"this is not cotton , looks very CHEAP",0
5,Love them,1
1,Wouldn't purchase again. Super cheaply made and uncomfortable to wear.,0
2,"Good quality, would have given it 4 to 5 stars for that. But since it is running really small (see measurement tape on the pics) I can only award it 2 stars overall.",0
1,Poor quality fake Kaye spade wanna b,0
3,Not worth $10 if you ask me. A lot of junk charms and beads. Description doesn’t mention beads. Thought it would be 100 charms.,0
5,Amazing!!!,1
5,Perfect.,1
3,"the pattern and colors are cute. however, the fabric is cheap and sort of scratchy on the inside and the buttons feel like they're going to pop off at any second",0
1,This is very pretty and has a great shine. However after wearing them for three days (I purchased two) I have three stones that have fallen out. I am not happy nor pleased with the quality of this product.,0
5,"Good quality fab, great fit. Love it",1
3,Purchased 6 pack of mask for a party. Only five mask were received. Other than that the 5 mask I did get were good.,0
5,"I absolutely love these. I am 4’8, 135 pounds and I got a medium and they fit loosely on my hips which I appreciate but fit nicely on my ass which I definitely appreciate. I would definitely buy it again",1
2,I bought these because of the description.  I wasn’t looking for flimsy yoga pants.  I need a pair of traditional sweatpants but I didn’t want cheap polyester.  These are 100% cotton.  So there’s that.,0
1,"The dress is very beautiful. However, the side zipper goes way too far up. It was impossible to continue zipping up without getting my underarm skin. Unless you have the longest torso ever!!!!! Don’t waste your time on this. The fabric was damaged as well when I received the dress. I had to return. The dress was somewhat heavy and looks really nice. But it was impossible to zip as high as they had it.",0
1,"Rhey run very small in size. But im reordering one whole size larger, instead of size 2 i'll go 3.",0
2,I love the wallet however when I got it it has an inch long cut on it.,0
4,It looked great.,1
4,"I purchased this as a chest massage gift for a loved one, so I can’t give a personal review. That being said, it seemed to be true to size, and came covered in a plastic bag. The color and texture were true to form, and it felt plenty sturdy.",1
5,"This bag works great. Very comfortable. Mine is packed to the brim with a four person tent two twin blow up mattresses and pump camp stove first aid kit small fire kit map and more small necessities.  It's comfortable to carry hours at a time and hold up to the abuse well.<br /><br />Update Sept 7 2018: still going strong being used for archery elk hunt. No tears<br /> My tent has been replaced with a 5lb sleeping bag, tarp,  game bags, 3 days canned food, small cook stove and fuel can, accessories, 3 liter water bladder, and a bit more. Oh and off the belt hangs a heavy ruger super Blackhawk 8&#34; barrel. All in all about 60lbs or a bit more. Heavy to pack for days but unbeatable performance for great price.",1
5,Great backup band after the Australian shepherd gets ahold of your watch,1
1,First of all be careful when you order. These are NOT natives even tho amazon promotes them and they look alike. Within ONE day of wearing the entire front is worn off showing the gray right through. They are also MUCH harder to slip on. DO NOT waste your money on these shoes. Get the Natives.,0
1,THWY SEEM TO BE IRREGULARS ONE SOCK FIT SO MUCH SMALLER THAN THW OTHER SENT THEM BACK THIS IS THW SECOND TIME I TRIED THAT ENOUGH  ITS NOT WORTH. IT,0
4,"It's exactly as pictures, it's nice and cozy but it's edges are raw, no seams. That might be on purpose",1
1,They stay on for about 3 minutes then fall off then can’t find it,0
4,Sups. It’s the only reason I gave a 4star is bc it doesn’t have sizes for plus size women,1
5,"Nice looking and design, if there are white big stone in the middle for the opinion.i will get white color next time.",1
1,"the XL is tiny!! T I N Y no one over a size 7 could wear it... giving them away to a teen ager. Impossible to get on, I wear a size 16 normally",0
3,I got a large and normally I'm a size 10/12 but these were a little snug.  Otherwise I like the look and the price.,0
5,Using this with my xbox one controller for project Xcloud. I have a Note 9 in a clear otterbox case and it fit perfectly! The plastic feels good and not cheap...,1
1,"i never even put it on.  it came in the expected time, but with no tag on the dress (suspect) and wreaked of perfume.  i couldn't tell if it was actually worn but i wasn't interested in testing it out.  i am returning.",0
4,With some cable ties I added some holiday spirit to my motorcycle.,1
2,To tiny no in space,0
5,Have same shorts for more than a dozen colors I use for playing my sport. I hope they come up with more popping colors in this type .,1
5,"Love the dress, fit nice and very comfortable",1
5,Very cute!,1
5,"This shirt is super cute and well made! I love the length of it, I have received compliments both times I have worn it. I ordered the brown in a medium and usually wear a medium or large. I say it is over sized which you can see by the pictures , will look good with leggings this fall.",1
5,Very high quality. Looks great on a suit coat. Just as advertised! Show your support for the second amendment and the National Rifle Association!,1
5,I bought this for a wedding rehearsal dinner and wore it with tall boots and high socks. It looked cute and was so comfortable! Not cheap fabric either. I'm 5'1 about 128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.,1
1,"I order 3 different colors from this necklace for presents. The reason I'm giving only one star is because when I ordered them the description said 925 sterling silver ( I attached the picture of my order). Well I was very disappointed when I received the necklaces and they were not silver!<br />I'll be honest , they do look good but I fell mislead.",0
1,I got the suitcase for my daughter for her international trip. It did not survive the one trip. Already on the first flight it broke. I know that airport personnel don’t handle each bag with care. But it should have lasted longer than one flight. Super disappointed.,0
5,I got this pretty quickly I think I'll order them about 3 business days ago when they came in the mail and they were super soft and a very nice material not too thin not too thick not see-through at all however they were a little long I'm about 5'6 so I might Taylor at the bottom so that they're not just dragging on the floor and get ruined but for the price I'm going to definitely look into what other patterns they have because I want more!!,1
5,Love it. Love it!!!! like previous comment on this type of bracelet has pearls (my favorite!) and other old stuff!  Actually use as heirloom!,1
1,This bracelet broke the first time I we're it and I really liked it so I would like to send it back please and thank you.,0
1,"Fits nothing like the picture. It flares out right above the slits on both sides and looks extremely awkward. The neck is not as wide as it shows, definitely doesn't have that &#34;off the shoulder&#34; look you're expecting. You get what you pay for. Thankfully it was as cheap as it was because it took so long to get that I couldn't return it.",0
5,Very nice sunglasses,1
2,"I ordered this top in the light green. I wanted to love it, the colors were exactly like the picture, but it was too HUGE. I'm 5'3&#34; and it was so long it fell past my knees. Also, it smelled like rotten fish. The odor was so bad that even if the top had fit I wouldn't have been able to keep it.",0
5,"These earrings are beautiful. I was hoping the jewel was a bit brighter and more golden, though. They feel nice on the ear, but do tend to hang forward a bit. They also come with a very nice gift box!",1
3,Really expected more from this mask. I wear glasses and they fog up every time. Very disappointed!,0
1,"I did not realize when I ordered these that they were not lined and offered no protective aspect. I take the blame for making the assumption that is these covid times all ""masks"" would be lined or have a ""pocket"" to add like a coffee filter of tissue- something to give protection.",0
5,Exactly what I was looking for. I wear these under my slacks to eliminate panty lines. A bonus in the winter months is it adds a little warmth,1
5,Lightweight and keeps my head warm. Just what I wanted.,1
4,I bought several of these for christmas present and everyone really liked them.  There's a dozen different versions to fit different personalities and it's a good price.,1
5,great,1
2,"They look cute from the front. But two issues: One, the style/length make them look like clown pants, someone at a circus on stilts would wear. Two, they run so high in the back they do not flatter your back end, unless it’s big and your waist is tiny. Sad because I really wanted to love them. If the style/color/length were slightly different they might work. They fit well other than length. I’m 5’5” 120 lbs, size M. I returned them. Zipper is also a small struggle.",0
5,Had a strange smell when it came it and it took a lot of washing and airing out!  It still smells a little but is cute on!,1
5,A gift,1
3,Smaller than advertised,0
3,"Ordered the Rose Gold but, received Yellow Gold. Design of earring is unique.",0
5,May be a tight fit for a larger head.,1
5,Bought them not for head band.  I have a lot hair. Those bands just for tight hair up or make bun without catch it. Love them.,1
1,"Such a beautiful dress, but it’s too small!<br />I usually wear a M or L, I ordered the XL, and it didn’t fit! :(",0
5,im using it for work,1
3,"Great color and very soft. This runs small compared to the fit of the picture. I am 5’ 1” and ordered the small and the sleeves are too short so I find myself pulling them down all day. Length overall is okay, just shorter than the picture so size up if you want that look.",0
5,Seems to be good quality. I can’t tell how durable yet.,1
2,"I dislike the inside stitching. It felt like something was constantly touching me, brushing my skin. I didn't like that feeling",0
1,"Purchased one dress in this selection from this maker and it was fabulous.  Ordered this one......not so much.  Although it is very attractive, it is a cheap polyester that is quite transparent and felt like I was wearing a plastic bag.  No ventilation and I sweat like crazy.  No air movement through the weave.  Bummer as it is a lovely pattern.",0
3,"Not as cute as the online picture. The large fits with no wiggle room so the medium would have been  way too small. The material is thin and have holes and not  just scuffed  marks as I thought. Overall, it’s kinda cheap looking but you get what you pay for I guess.",0
1,Item returned. Did not look like the picture. More like a mouse. Cheap quality,0
5,"perfect, i love it. Cords did not stand the wash though and went out during the wash.",1
5,"I bought these for my Fiancé and I. We love them. His fits perfectly, mine is a little big, but I did order a size up just in case. So no complaints.",1
5,Gorgeous...ready for Valentine's Day<br />Love the colors<br />Material is good quality<br />Great value,1
5,I love this dress. It’s super sexy and flattering. So glad I bought it,1
5,"I bought this necklace for myself as a cute surprise for my fiancé who is a mechanic.  I received it on time and the packaging was so cute.  One thing is, right away as I was taking it out of the box, the charms and the chain were all tangled up.  Like they were put in the box like that.  It was very frustrating. Another thing is I wish the chain was a tad bit longer,  but this will do and I can always change chains. My fiancé loves it and he wants me to wear it around all of his friends. Lol I will definitely repurchase from this seller again!",1
5,Exactly what she wanted for her birthday.,1
4,Very nice it fitted perfectly.,1
1,"There is discolaration around the collar, shoulder seams and a small narrow strip in the middle of the collar down approx 4 inches long",0
5,"I bought this for my sons 4 month photos and it’s super cute. Great thick material, it does not look cheap. Be warned however that the bottoms are very tiny! I received two sizes of bottoms thankfully. One is 0-6 months and the other is 6-24 months. The 6-24months will fit him for the pictures but definitely not for long. The material is thick so it doesn’t stretch and the elastic is very hard. The smaller size shorts look like they would fit a newborn during the first weeks of birth.",1
3,"My son is 12....It's a little small. The material is thin, but it will work until we get adult ones. Hopefully it fits a little better.",0
3,Sent it back.  Looked like some spots on face.,0
2,"It was a really nice piece but it soon became infected after I put it in, it took a couple days for me to notice and about a week for a keyloid or absess to form. I have a bump with pus.",0
5,"True to size. Love how it drapes/falls. It’s true what other readers are saying about the bulging pockets though, but maaaannnn It changes nothing for me. Plenty thanks to all the reviewers who put up pics of how to wear - with neck piece and belt. Y’all model stuff beautiful and inspire easily. Now I know how to wear mine.",1
2,"This is a nice looking bar, but the quality is bad. After a while of wearing it, the other end of the arrow was turning green. It would have given me an infection. I had to replace it. I do love the way the arrow looks, I just can't continue to wear it.",0
5,"I like the hem length is a little longer than normal. Very comfortable, heavy weight material. Matches a lot of different outfits.",1
2,"Pretty, feminine style, but the fabric was just too rough for me! It wasn't like burlap, but it had a texture that was uncomfortable. I love off the shoulder tops, but the elastic on this was oddly tight, even though the rest of the dress fit well. Returned it, but wish I didn't have to!",0
2,It's not a long cardigan. Very short.,0
3,"will not stay upright , top heavy, not easy to read, but OK item",0
1,It’s not the same photo,0
1,"The number is not pi. It becomes incorrect after 3 digits. 3.14159... is basic knowledge and forever stuck in the head of so many of us. The featured fraction is a reasonably good approximation if you need to use a fraction, but it is useless to carry the decimal equivalent of it beyond the hundredths place.",0
5,Very satisfied with purchase and delivery.,1
5,Ayudan bastante y quedan bien ajustadas,1
4,"It’s an awesome ring. Onyx is a grounding stone and is said to help with deflecting negating energy. I should’ve got a size larger, as it’s a little tight. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.",1
1,Umbrellas were too small . Needed them for a wedding ...bride was very upset<br />Not like online illustration<br />very disappointed after so much waiting for nothing<br />Please update your pictures online<br />I RETURNED BOTH ITEMS<br />STILL WAITING ON MY CREDIT,0
5,Great looking suit that's very comfortable,1
5,I absolutely love this! it's a little loose but very cute.,1
5,"I love a good pair of studs and these give a great variety. I absolutely love the black gems, I think they are really chic!",1
5,Great Product,1
5,"This is soft and comfortable. It wasn’t as long as I was expecting, but I still like it.",1
3,"The lights are great and keep the kids entertained, however, some of them don't work or stopped working after the first day. Not sure it's a battery issue though, cause if you squeeze the sides some of them light up until you release your grip.",0
3,"Buenas y muy resistentes pero el color no es como el de las imágenes, termina siendo más opaco (sin brillos)",0
1,"Cheap quality. The vinyl graphic is a piece of glossy cardboard inside the watch. Mine has scratches inside on the cardboard.  Feels flimsy and cheap. Don't bother with this.  Isn't worth the $2 + shipping.<br /><br />Update: I took the watch and tried to slide it on a leather strap I have for the watch I usually wear.  The underside of the watch has a raised lip that is metal/sharp, and it left a long scratch down the center of my leather watch strap.<br /><br />I tossed this thing in the trash.",0
5,Beautiful!  I love these earrings!,1
4,"Beautiful,  exactly what i wanted. Would have given five stars, but they're not quite as long as the photos make them appear. They are not shiny gold,  but more of a matte finish. The arrows each have a different hue, and oint of miner assists more green than the other when day side by side,  but when I'm wearing them they look like they match really well. That's what i wanted,  but worth mentioning.  My ears are a little sensitive and i was worried Abbott the weight,  but really they're not bulky and heavy at all!",1
3,posts way too long!,0
5,Soft and warm. Colors are vibrant and nice. It’s a Christmas gift and I will take pics to update review once I give it to my husband,1
1,These bras were so tiny!,0
5,"I really like this sweater! It's lightweight and really comfortable. I haven't tried Merino wool blend before, and I thought it would be itchy like other wool products I've tried, but this wasn't on me. I like that I can wear this sweater year round because it's so lightweight. The only thing I didn't like was, there aren't any pockets to put your phone in while your walking, it's not a deal breaker, but I always find them useful. I really like the bright and colorful patterns. The zipper works very smoothly.",1
3,"This shirt came faster than the expected date, that gives the 3 stars. I got the XL but my slender arms couldn't fit in it. The color is also not as seen, the shirt is short length-wise. Sad I cannot waer this shirt, and cannot return it either.",0
5,Simply beautiful,1
5,Love them.,1
1,This was purely a t-shirt dress and does not have much shape. It is also pretty see through and just shows every bump. I returned it as it was not flattering even for a thin person.,0
4,"Love the dress! While I received the package very quickly, mine unfortunately arrived with a rip on the front...BUT I contacted the seller and she was VERY kind and helpful!! The dress is a little bit longer than I expected, so I will not be wearing it for the event I purchased for, but it is still very flattering in all the right places (I'll just wear it to a different event than I originally anticipated)! For reference, I am 5'5&#34;, around 130 lb and I purchased the small and it fits perfectly. The top part is very stylish and I love the way it makes my shoulders look. I will post a picture shortly.",1
2,Wallet looks good but the color swatches off very easily.,0
2,"Update: After less than a month, the decorative bead has separated from the post on the pair I wear most often requiring repair. I take them off nightly.  I have probably worn them 12 times.  I loved these at first, but now I am not sure.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I love these! They are 6 pairs of earrings in one package.  I put them in backwards and wear the larger size end for a dramatic effect.",0
5,"Its functional and easy to carry. At first it takes a bit of time to get used to it. It feels like you are not carrying anything in your pocket. I am able to fit my money, IDs and 3 credit cards. You can put in a lot more, but the whole point I got this wallet was to keep it light.",1
5,Very nice quality!,1
2,"Bought this to take on trips and They had the right idea when making this, but it does not even come close to a true body pillow, it has the correct size but not the correct shape. You can't really hug it like a true body pillow. I have learned to only blow it up about halfway and it helps a little. You can't bend it like you would want to.  I have stopped trying to use it.",0
2,"reguLar tipicaL Liners,they are just okay.",0
5,My son likes it . It is comfortable  and good for children in summer season.,1
5,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She really loves dream catchers and this was the perfect gift for her. The price was just right too. I only wish it would've come in a box.,1
1,"Not very comfortable, lace is itchy and it doesn't stay up very well.",0
5,"It feels a little flimsy, but it is far from that. It has a big front pocket and a big side pocket. One side has vented holes and it unzips to allow for more storage space. The shoulder strap is located inside the bag. It is padded and adjustable. It has netted pockets on the inside. I have only used this for carrying my exercise equipment, and it has held up pretty well. It is foldable, whatever space you are using the bag collapse in that area.",1
5,"These are comfortable, stretchy and<br />more modest for a woman in her 60s than shorts",1
5,Fits like a glove and it’s beautiful. Got so many compliments.,1
1,absolutely so awful I threw it away  worse craftsman ship,0
1,Feels cheap. Doesn’t sit right. Sending it back,0
2,Didn't fit how I thought. It was tight at the waist so jot flattering at all,0
3,"These broke within the first five days, very disappointing- super cute and cozy though",0
1,I bought this product about a month ago and it worked perfectly for about three weeks now the clip doesn’t completely close anymore. It keeps falling off my belt loop and it’s really annoying. I would not buy this product again. Even if this was only a couple bucks I would not buy it if it only last this long.,0
5,Wonderful daughter inlaw loved it,1
3,"Not satin or any quality material, can still see through a bit due to Thiness of material, not really best quality but works well enough, pretty cheaply made for price.",0
3,"It fit really well and looked great, but I didn't have them a day and the material was all cracking and piling away. It arrived on time and what I was expecting. I wouldn't pay as much as I did for them again. Not worth the price.",0
1,Too big!,0
1,If I could not give a star at all I would. This product is garbage. Do not your money.,0
1,This piece is cheaply made. i took it out of the box and it was damaged. both earrings are smashed.  the crazy thing is the seller doesnt accept returns. obviously i will not be returning as a costomer and you should not become one.,0
5,It was something I had been looking for for awhile. It came earlier than expected. Looks exactly like the picture.,1
3,Not women/ girls size,0
5,"I love this charm! It is shiney, detail is crisp and on spot, and it is not too heavy as to weigh down your bracelet. I would definitely say that it is well worth the price paid and I will recommend this charm to any one contemplating it's purchase.",1
5,I love the fit!,1
5,They are very comfortable and not to short. Great for Everything you want to do.,1
1,"Different brand than is pictured. These are not true sized dress shirts. I originally ordered a 17.5 36/37 (My normal size), it wouldn't even button at the collar or anywhere else. I ordered the next size up, same problem. Returned them all. I know these are slim fit, and I wear slim fit in properly sized dress shirts. These are not those. Regardless, they should at least fit at the collar. A real shame as the colors are fantastic.",0
3,Its ok not something i would wear wont buy it again,0
2,"Were fine until I tried to take them out the day after I put them in. Both would not unscrew, acted like they were super glued on. My girlfriend had to use pliers to get them off.",0
3,Looks much cheaper than advertised.,0
1,Simply horrid color!  Lavendar looks like mud.  Extremely disappointed .,0
5,Awesome,1
1,Ordered the biggest size so I could have that extra length due to my bottom (thick girls know the struggle with dresses being too short) so a size 3x but fit like a M/L didn’t cover my bottom ... material was super see through too!,0
3,If you are over a size 12 and busty don't get it...it won't fit properly,0
2,The fabric is uncomfortable.,0
5,I organize my keys & hang theses on a single ring hooked to the top of my purse handle. I also have 2 I have used for sets of spare keys for my older children to have on-hand.<br /><br />When I hop out of my car to take a neighbors dog out - I select the single key to wear as a bracelet to keep it handy & I never have to search for my single house key(pink) or the remote start for my car (green).<br /><br />Big convenience for this 60+ lady!,1
5,Actually hasd an issue with the amazon site making it a size smaller but they fit perfectly and the item is so much more vibrant and coller looking in person! The seller is very quick to reply with issues and you can tell the item is of great quality.,1
3,beautiful but did not stay closed,0
5,Can't complain at all! Great alternative to the original band.,1
1,This is awfully cheap - it literally broke within 3 minutes of unwrapping it. Save your money.,0
5,My legs felt like they were getting a massage as soon as I put them on.  I was on my feet for 7 hours and my legs and feet were not fatigued and I had no swelling in my lower extremities.,1
5,Fit exactly as expected.,1
1,I wore this watch for two weeks before it stopped keeping time properly.  By the time I realized there was a problem it was after the return deadline.,0
3,will have it taken in a bit,0
5,Love this dress!!!!,1
1,It is definitely NOT PLUSH. It is not comfortable and it does not really keep you warm.,0
3,the gold pieces faded quickly,0
5,Price and durability,1
3,"This was a cute idea, and I loved the convertible style, but it runs rather large. Also, I'll note that it's made of a very hollow sounding plastic. Cheaply made for that kind of price.",0
1,This case has a horrible smell! It is nauseating and I have tried everything to lessen the smell. I tried using the case several times but between the rubber falling off all the time and the smell it's useless.,0
1,I brought these for my 5 year old granddaughter and they were so tiny they went right through her ear. Please don’t waste your money on this one. I was very disappointed.,0
1,Very disappointed! Stone fail out as soon as I took it out of the package!!!,0
5,I really like this jacket . It is a lot warmer than I expected however.,1
1,Muy pequeño y de muy mala calidad,0
5,"Very soft fabric, and comfortable. Not sure how well it will wear, given that this type of weave often seems to pill in the wash, but we'll see. In the meantime, I will enjoy it. I got lots of compliments the first time I wore it.",1
3,"Nice looking well constructed unesex socks.<br /><br />Unfortunately they don't seem to fit anyone in the house. My wife wears a size 8 shoe and she can barely get them on her feet, by the time she does they are stretched out paper thin and way to tight to wear. I wear a size 11, I knew the moment I saw them that they weren't going to fit so I didn't even bother trying LOL<br /><br /> It's not that we ordered the wrong size, There was no shoe sizes listed on the packaging or the web page, all it said was Min-Womens socks and nothing to indicate size so I just figured it was a one size fits all deal.<br /><br />All I can say is if these were intended for adults then they were intended for petite adults or more likely teens.",0
5,This will be super cute with leggings and some boots come fall. Can't wait!,1
2,Looks better online.,0
2,Material is somewhat silky and not cotton. The shirts are comfortably big however the shirt is awkwardly too large. Can’t even make it look cute off the shoulder. Top is very boxy.,0
5,I love them. Very nice package glasses fit well over my prescription glasses was Leary and love them they are great can see way better and it takes the sun glare away Im visually impaired and these work wonders for the price it came with a container and towel to clean with can't beat this deal I got the mirror ones and can't wait to get more pair they aren't dark like I wanted but can't complain they are polarized and uv 400 is as dark as it gets thank you thank you. They fit perfect.,1
3,Love the colors but it says sweatshirt material and the bottom doesn’t stretch. Very snug.,0
1,"Well, you get what you pay for. The length of the top is great, but the bra shelf is somewhere by the neck. waist and hips fit fine. If you are taller than 5 foot 5, you will have an issue fitting your chest in.<br />For reference, I bought a Medium. I am 5 foot 8 with a 38 inch chest. The material is quite thin.",0
3,So sad I had to return this item very pretty but it is not white it’s ivory color and I needed a white shawl I read the reviews prior to purchasing and it said it was white but yeah it is not definitely white they should actually change the description color on the item,0
1,"Too soft, does not keep shape, very disappointed with this product..",0
5,"Love it, and so do all of my friends.  So retro in the most awesome way!",1
1,Cheap material! Looks NOTHING like the pic! Don’t waste your money!,0
5,"I love this skirt! The price was incredible for the quality of it! It fits great! The material is stretchy, thick and comfortable! I love it! I'd recommend this skirt to anyone and would buy it again! If you are hesitant buying this, don't be!",1
3,It's beautiful but I'm up sad and very disappointed the bowtie has a whole inside  The shipping was on time Way faster i'm going to give them 3 star just for the delivery if there was no hole most definitely give them a 10 stars!!,0
5,3 y.o. son is very happy with his Cape :-),1
4,It’s very cute! But the top is way to big and the bottom fits great.The top fits me around it’s I don’t have enough to fill those cups lol.for reference I’m 5”7 and 130lbs B cup.,1
1,Don’t waste your time or money they make it look like it’s the best thing ever and it’s so false.,0
5,"I bought this for my daily walks. I have been using it for a year now and I love it!  When I purchased this, my phone was monstrously big and fit, along with a small tissue package and my car key in a smaller pouch. There is a velcro tab closer so your phone stays clean and dry. There are 3 holes at the top so you can position your headphones comfortably and out of the way. 2 ways to remove pack once on.",1
5,Quality and warmth,1
1,I work in a freezer unit for only a few hours a day at around -20F and the first time using these even with hand warmer in them my hands were still numb and the zipper snapped on both the first day I used them. maybe more for casual winter and not for working in.,0
4,Looks like the picture but I didn’t like the material,1
5,"Fits great, true to size.  Can wear as a vest or as a top.",1
2,"The hook was very bad, wore it once and it torned apart",0
1,"Terrible. It hurt to put it in because i had to bend the bar to make it wider. Once i got it in, i had to make sure the opening wouldn't get in my ear. The feather kept falling off and the ball was nearly impossible to get in.",0
2,I ordered these shirts for my daughter and I to wear at the beach. I could not wear mine because it was too small. My daughter could not wear hers because it was too small also. They are really cute ahirts but run really small.,0
5,"Quick shipping, great customer service.<br /><br />I LOVE my boots.<br /><br />I read suggestions and opted for ordering a full size larger than my original shoe size (I’m a size 7 and ordered a sz. 8) and I’m glad I did, they fit perfectly with room for thick, warm socks if needed, but they aren’t to big without them.<br />I learned my lesson when I first ordered them in a size 7 (my regular size) and with all the laces loosened, I was unable to fit my wide foot into it past the neck of the boot.",1
3,"I originally ordered a small however exchanged it for a medium. I have a tiny 7 year old. The small mask was bigger than the medium mask so although the medium body suit fits better, the mask is ridiculous. I wouldn’t buy it again.",0
5,Durable. Fits well. Colors are just as displayed.,1
5,Great product. It’s a new trend .Birthday present for my 18 year old son. He loves them. I also have red and black.,1
3,Kinda small,0
5,Great purse perfect size,1
4,"Fit Great and look great, Jersey type material. Drawstring is overly long.",1
1,"The material is not chiffon. It's not even close to chiffon. It's this weird waffle-scratchy-gauze material that reminds me of a terrible hospital gown. It's also made short and wide, so not really tunic length, but really baggy on the sides.",0
5,Great kids jersey,1
3,The material looks like plastic and the color is darker than the photo.,0
3,"This top looks ok, but the fabric is a bit thin. It is slightly larger than expected. Comfortable.",0
5,Amazing piece !!!!,1
1,"I washed it once, line dried it and it shrunk so much I can't even wear it anymore!",0
1,I ordered the grey one. The actual fabric of the shirt is almost pink. Like a dingy dark mauve. The collar and the cuffs are bright grey. It's the ugliest combo of colors ever.,0
3,Nice style. Not a fan of the fabric. A bit longer than expected. Love pattern.,0
1,"This was the second pair of shorts I bought.  The first pair fit perfectly, nice and roomy and was an XL.  I decided I wanted something a little roomier and baggy to wear lounging around.  Got these and they are MAYBE a size small if not XS.  Yet the tag in the shorts says XXL.  Clearly no one is paying attention when these shorts leave the manufacturer.",0
3,I like the material and all but I ordered the size based on the sizing information provided but it was way too large. That's saying quite a lot because I'm a DD and it was too big even in the chest. Based on the information on the sizing chart provided I was actually worried that the shirt might be too tight/small in the chest area and yet it turned out to be too large.,0
5,Perfect for every day use.<br />Enough colors to match any outfit.<br />Comfortable for my newborn.<br />Still fits her at 3 months.,1
5,I love the this charm. The colors are vibrant and elegant.,1
5,Delivered the day after purchase. Super sturdy band and absolutely sharp looking.  Wish I’d ordered this one right up front. Went through two of the plastic/silicone OEM bands before upgrading to this one. Recommend!,1
3,Nice,0
1,Not a good fit for c/d cup boobs. Sent it back,0
1,What I liked the most is the quick response from the manufacturer about my damaged item. What I didn't like was the fabric doesn't look like the pic. It's very cheap and not the same color as the pic.,0
5,"Bought two of these. First one - a Large which I found was ultimately too big for me (size 34). The elastic nature of the pants allows for plenty of movement. Love all the pockets. Second one I bought a size down and it fits me better (less loose). Otherwise, really like these - great quality!",1
1,Realmente una estafa no es de plata es de acero no tiene nada que ver con la fotos son unos amorales,0
1,Very disappointed in these. Fleeced lined to me means fleece in the pants!! All they are is double layered of the material. I live in Western NY where it gets cold so want fleeced lined pants for my husband!!,0
1,Nice color but it doesn't lay as nicely as in the picture. I looked like an ostrich.,0
3,"Cute hat, but NOT average adult size! It fits my 9 year old daughter perfectly but can only sit on the crown of my head and of course it doesn't stay on!",0
3,took a little while to get here but I'm satisfied,0
1,"This bracelet was so big that it would't stay on  my hand. I am not a  petite person, so for me to say that means it is very large. Had potential to be cute, but didn't fit well at all.",0
3,The cufflink its very big and heavy. After a few times of use you get used to it but people will always comment about the size.,0
3,"Not sure what man has this small of a wrist, but I guess coming from china, I'm not surprised.  The watch seems like good quality.  But I'm not sure how to read or set the time, and it came with no directions. Oh well, what's 10 bucks?",0
3,I wear a 2XL top and I ordered the largest size and it still didn't fit. Too narrow and too short.,0
1,"Over price, look cheap, I have brought few coaches.  This look nothing like the photos.",0
1,Unfortunately this watch band lost magnetism for the most part after only a couple of times wearing it the color is great comfort is great it’s convenient I love the convenience but it started Getting loose in the end of the day and then sooner in the day and in the afternoon and then slowly just really wasn’t holding on is tied to my wrist,0
4,"Looks great, little large but comfortable and no issues with wearing it.",1
5,As much as I love Alaric and Jeremy's ring I ordered it accidentally.  I thought I had enough money to buy that plus help pay bills.  Im now accidentally in the negatives so I cancelled it.  I got a response back saying its been cancelled but I just need to know when my money will be back in my account is all,1
5,Good,1
4,"My Sister and I love the sunglasses. Only one drawback was that 2 of the 4 ordered came unassembled and I had to be very careful in snapping the parts together. T'was like whoever originally packed them in their black bags was in a rush and just stuck them in there. Methinks the Pickers who put my order together could have not noticed (maybe) how the bag rattled and felt loose compared to the completed ones. Otherwise, they are comfortable, light and definitely gave my eyes comfort in the bright sun. Love the flip up lens!",1
4,"A cute little number for the price! I ordered the 3X based on my measurements; if you're curvy you can't order a large enough size in this dress, since it does run small. Despite my efforts the dress still turned out to be more fitted than I hoped. It still looks nice and it's not tight anywhere, but it does show my belly; I believe I can wear some Spanx and solve this problem though. It's also somewhat sheer, since it's a mostly white dress constructed from stretchy t-shirt material, so choose your undergarments accordingly. It's a pretty light Summer dress alone but it also looks nice with a pair of leggings, boots and a jacket. It's a very nice wardrobe staple and it goes with a lot of things I already own, so I'm pretty happy with my purchase. My measurements are 41&#34;-35&#34;-45&#34; and the 3X fit me just right, but is a little fitted.",1
5,Fits perfect. It is good quality and my son says it is very comfortable. Quick shipping,1
5,I am one of those that was really happy to see Ghostbusters: After Life.  My local theater has a mask required in place & this worked out for both fun & safe.,1
2,Absolutely adorable dress.  I love it.  Went by size chart and still ordered a size larger than I usually wear and this is too small.  I wear a size L and ordered an XL and honestly probably need an XXL.  Ridiculously small. :(,0
3,So I bought the case because I wanted to protect my watch more than just a screen protector. It's comfortable and does a good job. The bessel is a but stiff when the watch is inside the case but still works. About 3 weeks the clip broke off of the band so only a 3 out of 5. I work 2 very intensive jobs as far as watches go so I give it props for lasting as long as it did. I'd say if you want to buy a case it will be fine but this on3 won't stand up to some rough and tough wear and tear.,0
3,"Great shirt, my son wears them to work out at Cross Fit",0
1,"Tarnished, terrible  hard to believe  this was for sell",0
1,Runs super small! If you a large go 2x. Its cute im just mad it is not trie to size!,0
2,"Much too wide considering the length.  I've tried to love this shirt, I really have.  I like other shirts in this style, but this one just doesn't seem to look good no matter how I style it.  I feel like it is made for a shorter person, but the width would be overwhelming on a smaller build.",0
5,I can breathe through this mask. It’s pretty,1
4,"Beautiful mask but came defected. There was one black rhinestone instead of white in the middle of the mask, so it looks like a dirt.",1
5,"Its exactly in the website description; well presentation packaged. Very comfortable, I loved it, the color is beautiful and bright, I bought in other different  color.",1
5,"i loooove this necklace it looks great on me, had to buy it twice!",1
2,Length good ( will b wearing w/leggings ). I don't like tops that STOP at crouch area. I didn't like that length when I was young and now at senior age still DON'T. I can layer it with sweater in winter and wear alone in spring & summer. I thought I ordered grey and got light olive. Will keep bcause I have olive leggings and booties.,0
5,They fit the frames and look good,1
5,Great glasses for those who do not need expensive frames.,1
5,"These are great / got them before a long travel overseas and I wore them all the time , for sun protection and to stay warm in the evenings - great colors and they don’t have a big logo on them which I really enjoy",1
5,"These did run just a tiny bit big, but the comfort is spot on. The extra padding is in all the right places. The socks stay put on vigorous hikes. They really help keep my feet dry. I am super picky about caring for my feet. These do the trick!",1
4,I'll be giving these away to friends for quickie halloween costumes so they don't need to be the best.  not to say they are awful which they are  not.,1
1,"Even if the mirror finish wasn't scratched off on the pair I received, it still wouldn't be worth this price. Spots of clear coat cracked along the bottom. The bag it comes in for storage is better quality. I'd expect to see these glasses at a dollar store.",0
2,My daughter loves them but trimming them down to fit her wrist makes it so they don't stay closed,0
1,Too small and hurts nose.,0
5,Love this band. Got the multi color and love the way it matches and brightens my outfit. Magnet works great. Really pleased. Think I need a new color now.,1
5,Strongly constructed good quality,1
5,"This ring is so beautiful. Everyone always makes comments about how pretty it is. The only thing is that it's a little big for a 7"".",1
1,Size not close/ returning,0
3,"Not decided will keep it or not. This kimono is not the same like the picture, especially the closing in front. The only think I like is the material and that's is long ENOUGH. I am 5'7&#34;,size16/18. I bought XXXL ,fit well,color is not too excited, but acceptable. I was planning to ware it with jeans or over dress,but looks more like something I would ware at home, like house robe.",0
3,"The flip flops are so comfy! However, the first time I wore them one of the decorative medallions fell off and was lost.",0
2,Runs very small,0
5,Wore this dress after just having a baby. The fabric was slightly shiny but in a dark room it’s not noticeable. It’s very stretchy and easily conceals. Great dress glad I purchased it!,1
5,Perfect sweatshirt,1
2,I thought it would be a little sexier but it was very conservative looking.,0
4,"A little smaller than what the picture shows, but still very very cute! I'm very happy with my purchase",1
5,Beautiful necklace!,1
1,Very cheaply made. Not happy with it at all.,0
2,"This dress fit as expected, but isn’t very flattering. The material is not soft, but stiff. I was unsure of the color when I ordered it, but apricot turned out to be a like khaki type color.",0
4,"I've been using this watch strap every day for months now, and the plastic is still in great condition. There are no cracks or discoloration like you might worry about. I mark it down one star because sometimes i feel like sweat builds up under the band and irritates my skin. This is only if it has been exceptionally hot, however - the vast majority of the time I get no irritation from this band. Highly recommend.",1
3,Would have been nice but runs about 2 sizes smaller than advertised. Unless you like skintight restricting clothing- Big girls beware.,0
5,gave many away WORKS,1
4,"Beautiful and comfortable, but it kept falling down from my face.",1
3,"very short, does not cover behind. I am 5'6&#34; 130 lbs. Not sure how the girl on the video could be 5'10&#34; and it cover her behind, unless they changed the sizing of the product. Other than that, fabric quality is fine and tassels are a cute touch.",0
5,I ordered a sz:M and it fit just right. I’m 5”5 - weight 140 and I’m pretty curvy . I was not sure if I should had ordered a Large due to my big hips. But while looking into the chart I took a risk and ordered the Medium.<br />I will post pic soon..,1
1,Crappy quality material and they were way too big for my head. More like a necklace than a headband. No wonder so many come in a pack for such a cheap price,0
1,It would be adorable if it didn't have the word &#34;DREAMY&#34; in GIANT letters across the back with added bling....it's cute enough to be house wear but there is no way that I would ever wear it in public.,0
3,a little bit small for my face. But overall they are good for the price.,0
2,They’re cute but you wear them and then wash them to find out that there’s no more elastic to the underwear. so no more grip your underwear will fall off.,0
5,Love them,1
4,"The colors of this shirt are vibrant and the quality of the image and the shirt itself are excellent. It appears that it will stand up to repeated wear and washing but since we just gave this as a birthday gift it has yet been put  to the test. That is the only reason I didn't  give 5 stars. I will try to remember to come and update this review after awhile. My 3 yr old daughter loved the shirt! She's petite, and I got a 4t, so on her it's a little long but it fits well otherwise. I would say that it is true to size.",1
4,This hat really is cute but a little large on my head. I love the color.,1
5,They are so comfortable!,1
1,I tested these to see how much blue light they block on the online blue blocker glasses tests.  It appears they did not block any bluelight<br /> &#34;blue light blocking glasses test&#34;<br />Google it.,0
1,I order this before a large and had to send back . It was like a small.. so they sad order 2x  Will be equivalent to a US large but still on the snugh side.. I take a medium to a large but suggest if some take a large get a 3 x and will be equivalent to a large or a medium.. would send back but need it for a trip this Saturday will have be carful not eat to much .. lol like the quality and fabric but not size chart .. very disappointed !!,0
4,"just another hat for my collection. Good quality, wears well. Will buy it again when it dies.",1
5,STYLISH & JUST RIGHT,1
5,I am very please with the feel and how thick the material is. Will definitely order more.,1
5,im a penguin collecter. this scarf is perfect. no wrinkles or static. I was very pleased with this scarf.,1
2,"I found this shoe to be too sparkly and too bright--almost garish. In addition, the shoe is best for a wider foot and the strap is scratchy.  However, it is the material glued to the insole that my granddaughter found most annoying--do a close up of the inside of the shoe before purchasing.  Not sure that I will return them, as we live in another town, but I certainly was not elated with my selection",0
5,A nice hat pin for a transplanted islander...perfect fit and trying to maintain some aloha up here in cold country!!,1
1,Rings were not what I expected no where near  Poor Qality,0
5,Love super adorable my niece will absolutely love it ! It’s not cheap feel it’s super soft and true to size !,1
1,I ordered a 2 xl thinking it would still fit loose around these bad boys. Nope. Not happening.  I'd post a picture but its just not ok lol . Anyways just no. Ill keep it and sew some lace down the sides and hope it fits then.,0
2,I didn’t like the chemicals. I didn’t look too deep into it but I know I just got these for my little girl because I used to wear them when I was a child. But I won’t be letting my daughter use them due to the toxins,0
5,I love it ! Well fitted and love it with high wasted pants! :) pretty happy about this. Wouldn’t recommend putting it in the dryer should air dry. Overall if you like small crop tops I would recommend!!,1
4,It was a gift for my mother and she liked the bag,1
1,The picture on the belt buckle is cool but the quality is terrible!!!<br /> I only got to wear this one time before the ball that goes in to the hole on the belt for sizing just snapped off.<br />I'm going to attempt to solder or tack weld it back on but this should NOT have happened after using the belt buckle just one time!!!😡😠🤬,0
5,My daughter loved it,1
5,Great for my senior mom in nursing home.  Great quality!,1
1,"This is extremely small. Definitely made for a child, and no option to extend the size with the extra loops at the end because they are too small for the hook to fit through.",0
1,Nothing advertised about this product is true. Advertised as medium length sterling silver chains. Chains are barely larger than chokers and are definitely NOT sterling silver. My chains quickly discolored and left green marks on my neck.,0
5,It is great and can be used so many ways,1
2,"This band looks and feels great, and that's about it.  The screws that hold it together fall out (if you tighten screws too tight the band doesn't fit or click in right) because you need it to be flexible to snap in.  After daily use I lose screws and the springs that hold it firmly together.  There are not many options out there so I bought a second one and placed a drop of super glue on the screws to hold them in place but I'm not sure if that's ideal.  I'm going to try to return the defective one because it's shouldn't do that or I shouldn't have to super glue the screws to be safe.<br />Oh, because the screws didn't hold my watch went flying off my wrist hit the ground and I had to file a insurance claim on the watch because it hit the ground so hard it wouldn't charge and the bevel turned but not very easy.  Use with extreme caution.",0
5,"Love this bra.  Looks great and has that &#34;definitely not a cheap bra&#34; look.  Came with loads of straps and even a set of clear straps.  Got this to wear with a dress that has a weird neckline, but love it so much it basically became my everyday bra.",1
1,"I'm sorry I can't give this a better review. This item not only has a funny strong plastic smell, it collects so much lint that it is actually unwearable. I mean it picks up everything. It ruined my whole evening",0
3,Adequate bag for my dance shoes.,0
3,"I gave this to a teenage granddaughter.  It is cute - too cute for an old lady I think.  Also it hangs funny - at an angle, which my granddaughter doesn't seem to mind",0
2,Arms are small and not like the picture,0
3,Bra piece was a bit small . But the swim suit is truly beautiful.,0
5,Love these!  Second pair we have bought.  Great for wide feet babies until like other brands they are actually wide!,1
5,"For reference I’m 5”3 and 167 pounds. I ordered the large and it fits perfect, it’s loose, comfortable, and perfect length.",1
1,Absolutely beautiful.  Unfortunately the second time I put them on the arm fell right off the glasses.,0
2,This was very cute with a great feel to the material. It just wasn't adjustable and therefore was too short for my torso.,0
3,Didnt get to wear it much.,0
5,Omg! They are so cute and I really like how organized and well packaged this tagged arrieved.,1
5,Adorable and relatable.,1
4,"They are cute!  As far as comfort, they are comfortable. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because I was hoping the shoes would be a bit lighter in weight.",1
5,I absolutely love this!! It’s so comfortable and fits just as I hoped it would :),1
3,"I bought the wallet and handbag, and both are really beautiful. I get a lot of compliments on both everywhere I go. And the great stamped leather pattern matches many of my western belts & boots. However, it isn't well made. Within the first week of use, the leather shoulder straps started cracking and fraying, and lots of the threads in the stitching are popping out. This continues so I'm not sure if this bag will last long. And the disappointing thing is that I'm not hard on bags. I guess it's just not well made.",0
5,"We haven't used this product yet, but it came as described and the design is beautiful!",1
5,If you have trouble waking up in the morning this actually works. You truly get an adrenaline rush and feel better upon waking up.,1
5,Great lanyard! Great service,1
1,Quality of the metal is terrible! It looks really cheap when you get it not like the picture. I expected it to be smaller and it was quite large.,0
1,Rosegold color lasted less than one day.  Noticed paint chipped off the second day.,0
5,We bought this set for my daughters halloween costume. It is a great quality product! The little wand broke quickly but I think it was played with a little to rough. But everything else in this set is perfect for any kiddos dress up collection!,1
5,100% amazing! Better than the one I bought @ target! Will buy from again! Not cheap fabric!,1
3,These charms are not 16mm x 19mm as advertised. They measure 11mm x 14mm,0
2,"I love Pattyboutik and have over 20 tops from this brand. I have also bought from the maternity line and love those tops and the maternity ruched dresses as well.  But I just don't like these dresses because of the material. The fit is right and so is the length but the polyester is really cheap to me and I don't like the feel of it on my skin.<br /><br />Pattyboutik, please make this exact dress style in the jersey/spandex material you make most of your shirts out of and I'll buy a dozen of those too!",0
5,So pretty and very unique!  Feels substantial - I can't wait to wear it!<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount for an honest review*,1
2,This is a nice looking dress but it was way too big and unflattering.,0
5,Perfect for a Princess Jasmine cosplay. The earrings are a nice size and lightweight. I definitely recommend these,1
2,Too long and sloppy.,0
5,Love them and what a great price!😊,1
1,They did not send the colors shown. These arrived one day before school started and they were supposed to be for my son. They showed up with pink and rainbow. Only one was suitable for boy colors. Very upsetting.,0
5,Good quality shirt with a nice fit. One of my granddaughter’s favorite.,1
2,Difficult to take watch chains out. Not really worth the money to be honest,0
2,"A pretty bracelet and lightweight, but there was a kink in it right out of the box and part of the stamped design was missing. It wasn't as flexible as I like.",0
2,"I wear size 6.5 to 7, hence ordered these in size 7. They are too small and to make matters worse, the plastic (yes, it is made of really hard, stiff plastic not rubber or jelly) is so hard that it scrapes my skin and toes a lot. I have many blisters just from wearing them for three days.",0
5,"[[VIDEOID:4393df1f4344241c28a4358091612447]] Quality material, Nice Bag without the High price",1
1,Shoulder straps broke after a couple uses,0
3,"These was very cute for a Candy Land theme reading night at our school. However, they were extremely heavy. And on my way home from the first night wearing them one of them fell apart.",0
3,"Pretty basic.  Thin material and no sweat band.  However, the product price matches so this is a decent purchase.",0
2,this item was too small for me.,0
3,It's T-shirt material alright. I got a large hoping it would be lose on the waist but not exactly what I had in mind.,0
5,The quality of the product was better than expected.  The size was true to size. My son loves them. I will be ordering another pair.,1
3,"The fabric is totally different than what I was expecting. (think heavy polyester) And it is HUGE on me. Luckily it has adjustable straps. But even with that, I should send it back but figured if nothing else I could wear it as a swim coverup, as it is much longer than appears on model and I'm 5'8.<br />PS. This order took almost a month to arrive.",0
1,I was expecting 4 polyester tops. Received 2 cotton  and 2 polyester tops. Description said tops were 100% polyester.  Cotton tops looks cheap.....sending both sets back,0
5,I have 3 pairs now and they are soooo comfy!,1
2,"Most of it leaked out in shipping.  They did give us a refund, but still wanted us to initially return the mostly bottle.<br /><br />Didn’t quite work as we hoped for our glasses either.<br /><br />Ended up just throwing away.",0
3,The top did not cover me as all. I had to end up buying another white top just so I could still use the bottoms. They were small too but the top..even if you were a B cup it would cover your nipples.,0
4,"I wore it a few times, I love the look, it really looks like a quality necklace. However after just a few wearings, it ripped. I'm going to try to get it fixed by a jeweler because I really like it",1
4,It's beautiful. I like it,1
5,"This bracelet is absolutely adorable! I love that depending on how you wrap it, it can fit any size wrist. When I received it I tried it on to see how big it would be since I was giving it to my mother and saw how veristile it is! She loves the bracelet especially since this teal color is her favorite color. Nice little added bonus was it came in the very nice gift box.",1
1,Didn’t get on ✖️ 4 a gift. O really is a postage issue. I would have loved them I’m sure,0
5,It looks really nice.,1
3,"I figured I’d get a pair of these sunglasses since I lost my last pair.<br /><br />Based on the the reviews I have seen, it seemed like the glasses were big. So i figured I’d order them because I have very wide temples.<br />As I received them, they were the complete opposite. The lenses were tiny and the arms of the glasses were too close to each other, which squeezed the temples of my head.<br />They were nice and were great quality, but they weren’t the ones for me.<br /><br />Giving them a 3 stars cause they’re nice, but they only good for small-headed people.<br /><br />If they make bigger ones, I will definitely get another pair.",0
5,Perfect Present,1
4,"I bought this as a present for my ex-wife before i was going to propose to her a new lifestyle and make us all happy but unfortunately she left before i could show her the quality watch, besides the enormous heartbreak and massive financial failing. The watch holds up to me rummaging through trash. Shines bright enough for me to see in the dark and i try to hunker down under park benches. The water resistance is pretty good too, I've had to walk and sleep through massive rainstorms and the watch has yet to croak on me. Overall great purchase",1
5,"It was just a little snug,but it was nice to wear.BEWARE OF GLITTER! I wore it to a concert, were skin tight was the trend.",1
2,I love the patterns - just wish they fit my FitBit,0
2,"the description was not accurate, photos displayed a brown inner fur but I received a white inner fur, this was a false description on the seller part, would not purchase from them again.",0
4,Gets the job done.,1
4,"Looks get 5 stars!! However, sadly, already cracking open! I get that the shoes are on an 8 year old who plays hard. But that is why I took a star away.",1
5,"Good quality chains, jump rings and lobster clasps.  The six colors are vibrant and are perfect for jewelry making.  Will definitely buy more in the future.",1
5,Very nice 👍,1
5,wife loves it because of the pockets. it doesnt look anything like the picture though,1
2,"Cute dress, but WAY TOO TIGHT up top. Couldn’t even get the zipper a quarter of the way up, but the rest of the dress fit fine. I would definitely SIZE UP",0
4,Kept warm snd dry longer thsn expected. Vslue for price,1
1,It is too small and poorly made. I ordered a large and it fit like an extra small. I am 5'4 200lbs and curvy the material is streachy and ok. I wear size 12 pants and xtra large shirt due to large boobs...,0
2,Wish I would’ve read the material before I purchased it. It is mostly polyester. I was thinking it would be a cotton T-shirt. I have got compliments but I do  not love the fabric,0
4,"The hat and patch are great quality. I was a little disappointed to see the patch was starting to lift when I received, but was able to fix with fabric glue.",1
5,"Oh my lord, these are HUGE! And that's an understatement! Lol<br />They are fantastic",1
1,nice design but bad stitching quality.  this shirt will fell apart after couple washes.,0
5,Fabulous jacket. Cool. Sturdy.  Really feel protected.,1
5,I like the product,1
4,Bought them for my son and I'm not sure if he's taken them off yet! Says they are very comfortable and he can wear them outside.<br />We'll see if they hold up,1
3,It was nice put it dont stay on,0
1,"Very disappointed, The Unicorns look weird.<br />My daughter does not like them.",0
5,I love the variety of colors and studs. The hoops are my favorite tho!,1
3,"I am 5'9 and around 200 lbs, with long legs, wide hips, and a large butt & bust. Since I am tall, I expected this to fit my broad shoulders and big chest. Well, it did fit, but there is still a lot of extra fabric. Despite having a large bust, there is too much fabric around my chest and it exposes my bra a little. I would only order this if you are comfortable showing cleavage and don't mind it being a little large. I kept this purchase because it is super cute and the fit isn't the worst.",0
3,Expected the sister tag to be larger,0
5,"I ordered this scarf because I didn't want to be bothered with a purse.<br />It is a great idea and I was able to fit some cash, credit cards and phone in the pocket.<br />The pocket is deep and the scarf itself is made well, and it is stylish. It comes in so many colors it was hard to just pick one.<br />I will probably be ordering more, as I wear more scarves in the fall.  Thanks for a great product!",1
5,These glasses are of EXCELLENT quality and build.  I haven't tried them while driving but pretty sure they'll work great.  Their weight is light and the grip around my head is fantastic.  This is an excellent choice.,1
5,actually fits larger than I expected :) but still good.  great quality for the price!<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review,1
3,Fit was more of junior-sized than adult-sized.,0
5,"I've had them 2 years now and the quality is excellent; they don't chip and they still look new.  I am ordering them again as I lost many and they are so perfect to color coordinate daily with any outfit of any type (from jeans and tshirt days or business casual, to days I wear my 40s/50s dresses).  I don't usually review things but they are so good and I have been so happy with them I'm going out of my way to do just that!",1
5,[[VIDEOID:70e2e83156778d0a55fa438e3e64b68b]] Me encanto,1
5,"I wear a women’s 7...bought the 7. They fit great. I’m used to wearing flats or slip on vans; so to me these feel bulky, but I’ve gotten used to them. I have been shopping in them and they have been comfortable. They also keep my feet warm. We are in Georgia so we do not have the super cold weather, but the weather has been in the 20s and 30s and I’ve been glad that I’ve had them. I also get a lot of compliments when I wear them. I like the flat sole on them. Some similar type boots will have that separate sole on the heel. I always feel like I can feel it when I’m walking. That’s one reason why I got these is for the flat sole.",1
5,"Adorable set! Great quality loved it all...reviews mentioned balloons deflating, they sure did. I'm not sure anywhere mentions self sealing but they are not, expect to put a piece of tape over the opening.",1
4,"I bought the XL in blue, I usually wear a size 12 in dresses. 41-33-41, it falls 2 inches below my knee and covers cleavage, perfect for me. the neckline can be pushed down for a different look. It is more like a size 14 than a 12, so a bit big, all in all a good summer purchase.",1
4,A bit snug but they are nicely made,1
5,"Dress fit perfectly! I got a 1X....I'm 6ft tall & weigh about 280 but I have a very curvy, hourglass shape. This dress really showed off my shape & I loved it.",1
5,He loved it!,1
2,The glass wwre not gradient,0
2,"Not thermal and the print in the product description photos is not what I received.  Other than that, the quality is ok for knit jersey t-shirt fabric.  I am 5'11&#34; 165 lbs with a 31&#34; waist and 32&#34; inseam.  The Asian XL is my size but I am returning these because I don't like actual print.  It's too Union Jack busy for my taste.",0
4,"The top of the dress is a little awkward, but nothing a blazer can't fix.",1
5,She loved it,1
1,Broke within a week,0
3,"I needed a dress belt because the 15-year-old one I had was finally looking ratty enough to replace. I got this one because it claimed ""top grain leather"" and the pictures looked good. It looks fine, but it feels more like plastic than leather, and I question how long it will actually last. It wasn't bad enough to return (also I only wear a dress belt a couple times a year). And for the price it's fine. I just don't think it's actually top grain leather.",0
5,Awesome,1
5,"Son was happy with item, when viewed on line however did not show a side profile so it was a little different than what was expected.",1
1,"Opened box, frowned, closed box, returned. I think they are made out of cardboard.",0
5,Perfect for sleepaway camp.  It is big and sturdy- we can fit everything my son needs for a summer away.,1
1,Warning this item runs 3x too small.  I ordered a 2X and it would not fit a friend who is a size Medium.,0
5,The quality was very good.  It fits great. Only wore once so not sure how well it will hold up.  Will update my post if it changes.,1
5,The item is perfect fit!,1
3,I just don't like how this particular skirt fits.,0
5,The seams make wearing these gloves distracting but they look cute with the costume.,1
3,Cute but way too small. I ordered my usual size.,0
3,"This item was a good fit, but I felt it looked very matronly on. I didnt feel ""good"" in it.",0
5,Awesome cap. Gave as a gift.  Recipient loved it.,1
5,I like how it's adjustable. It fits very well.,1
3,"nice design,but bad quality.<br />i tried one time... and that’s it",0
4,It is sleek and fits well and perfect as it is not bulky but still protects the phone.,1
5,The lining is great,1
5,Love this dress! It's so comfortable. My favorite part is that it has pockets.,1
4,"You won't pass this down as a family heirloom, but it's cute and is a nice light jacket for the office or at a restaurant. I would buy it again once the one I have snags and unravels.",1
5,Works great -  maybe should read the instructions -  works in sync variable of shutter and aperture or independent -  125 and ISO 100 then just hold the main button- then fire to meter an incident point -  working with lighting aspect ratios and light to camera aspect ratios as well -  makes it easier -  if doing high key look at the shot after on the PC as the viewfinder isn't what is - Measure your own and little to no adjustments to exposure or contrasts needed-,1
1,Poor,0
4,"I was surprised to like this tank as much as I do. I didn't think the blue tie dye would be a very flattering look, but it's subtle not obnoxious tie dye if that makes sense.<br />The tank top itself is a nice, soft, cotton with a slight stretch to it. I was offered this in a size medium but typically wear a large. I'm about 165 lbs. The medium feels kind of snug but still fits.<br />On the top left side the brand name Ruby Diva is stitched into the tank professionally with a gold/yellow thread. I thought that alone would be a deal breaker for me but it blends right in without being too ""flashy"".<br />Material is thin and breathable. Perfect for a hot summer day. No obvious flaws in the stitching and there was very minimal shrinkage after washing and drying it.<br />I would absolutely recommend this item.",1
4,"I am 5'8 and 225 lbs, I ordered a 2x, I was looking for a tighter & heavier spandex. Not what this is. They were comfortable in the hip/butt and loose on the waist. I took in the waist myself. The bants are long enough and comfortable.",1
3,"I did not love the fabric, plus the sleeves were too tight but the hips were too big.",0
2,Two holes in the seam. One was rather large the other about 2.5 in.,0
1,Zipper broke,0
5,Fits great,1
4,"I really love thir, is a little uncomfortable but very bearable, im size s - m , but fits me perfect",1
1,Material is not like the picture it’s a shiny cheep weird material,0
5,Looks just like the photo! I love it!,1
1,It no longer fits!  Now it is in the trash.,0
3,"Pros: Nice leather wallet, great number and size of pockets, good price.<br />Cons: The embossed letters and graphics on the front are cheap looking, and much less subtle than it looks on the picture.<br />Conclusion: It has the perfect number and size of pockets for passport, cards, visas, cash, etc. The embossed part looks different than the picture — a lot wider cut and cheap looking. If I had known this, I would have gone with a simple blank style.",0
5,"I over estimated size. I'm a 36dd bust, 5'2&#34; 150lbs. I think I could've got the large instead of xl. But because stretchy it still fits and looks good do I'm keeping it. I think it would look better with a belt but otherwise comfortable and flattering for a girl with hips like me lol.",1
1,I ordered white but I received light purple 🙃,0
5,Beautiful white lace dress. Excellent fit.,1
5,It looks so pretty and goes with my other bracelets.,1
1,"I was very disappointed. I wear a size 12 US and ordered XL.  The wouldn't button. The fabric was thin and I just did not like the feel.  The button itself was extremely loose and the zipper was busted. Definitely should size up if you purchase, but I do not recommend these jeans.",0
3,"Pants for lovely, the shirt was extremely tight on my bust area and I have A cup boobs. I really wish you could order the pants and shirt sizes differently. I wouldn't gotten a small in pants and Medium in shirt",0
4,I love how shiny the diamonds are and how flowing it is. but the ball is very hard to get off.,1
5,The visibility is even better than I thought it would be. I can rest my neck and still watch TV!,1
1,Like the concept of the dress..comfortably loose from the waist down. But it was cut way too tight across the chest area and under the arms. I think its meant for smaller chested women(about an size A/B). Ended up giving it away. :(,0
5,I reciced all 9 headbands and they are adorable!! Fit my baby perfectly along with leaving aome room to grow into. Also veey affordable!,1
5,Bought a second one for father in law. Work great,1
4,Pretty.  Somewhat large though but overall flattering for what it's supposed to do.,1
5,Love it!!,1
2,"Not stretchy.  Too big for 36"" table",0
2,"Too big, awkward, and cheap looking. Never used it for anything since the shape is so awkward. Trashed it instead",0
2,"FIRST TIME I USED IT, THE GROMMETS STARTED POPPING OUT<br />DON'T BUY THIS BELT",0
2,"I ordered 10, only got 8 and they were not as pictured.",0
3,Running smaller as compared to the ones I already had.,0
3,it’s very long. But cute.,0
1,I purchased the 'This is Hell' design. The borders are hemmed in WHITE thread. This makes the mask look cheap and crappy.  Definitely not worth more than $1. Very disappointed.,0
3,Does leave marks on the skin and the silver coating appears to be fading rather quickly. love the design but want better quality.,0
2,"I purchased this shirt for myself as I liked the unusual neck line.  It arrived on time and nicely packaged.  The fit was odd though in the front- the strips that make up the neckline are sewn in a odd angle/way and unless you enjoy pulling on your shirt every 2 minutes to stop them from bunching up, it would not lay flat as shown in the picture.  I ended up giving this to my teenage daughter to wear and she seems to be enjoying it more than I did though she too has issues with the way the shirt lays.",0
5,I love this watch band! This is a replacement for my silicone band. It is so much better than silicone! I use to get tons of irritation under my silicone band because it didn't breath well. The leather band is comfortable to wear daily with no irritation. Great band and it looks good too!,1
2,"This was not an official anything. It was a cheap knock off, no rhinestones, just a cheap iron on or possibly screen print from a picture of the rhinestone shirt. And the picture was crooked to boot. Waste of money to return. Will give away.",0
3,I like the sweater but it fits a little awkward,0
4,but you can tuck your hair in and still works good,1
5,These are very cool and the companies service and price was great ! Im buying the single shed antlter next ...,1
1,This dress is horrible! What I received was nothing like what is shown. I ordered the blue and that was the only part that was accurate. The dress wasn’t even hemmed. There’s a weird wire around the top and the material is so stiff and ruff. Extremely cheap looking and not anything I would wear out. I bought this for a photoshoot and photoshoots are very forgiving of bad garments but this one was impossible to make look right.,0
5,Very cool. fit fine.,1
5,Works as advertised.,1
5,this purse should be 6 stars my wife was stunned when it arrived on her birthday and people at her work  also loved this  purse and kept asking my wife where did she get it! If your looking for a gift for a lady who loves purses guys this is the one to get!,1
5,"I never take my jewelry off, I wash with it, and play with it...I have broken so many chains it's not funny. Most necklaces and bracelets come with chains that if you sneeze wrong it's broken and the clasps are a joke most of the time. Another reason why I stick with sterling silver now.<br /><br />This chain so far looks like it will go the distance, and if it lasts a year with me then you can be sure it is quality! I will let you know. SO far it's been a month which is still pretty good for most chains.",1
1,This necklace is made of extremely cheap materials and is very close to falling apart as soon as you try to open its packaging.,0
3,Me encantó muy cómoda justo a mi estilo mi zise perfecto,0
3,"Fits well and is comfortable buut its missing the ""not today"" graphic and its honestly kinda cheap graphic.",0
1,"Very very disappointed. Not at all the wings that are pictured. The wings are cheap, bright pink, and don't even stand up. If you are interested in this costume because of the pretty wings they are advertising , prepare to be severely disappointed. Will be returning.",0
3,More pink than red.,0
5,I bought these so I could use for a faster transition from bike to running in triathlons. I followed the instructions to get them on my running shoes--really quite easy and didn't take very long--and ran in them for the first time this morning. Wow! Shoes were easy to put on and easy to take off--almost like wearing slippers. And the hold was perfect during my 40 minute run. Great stuff. I'm going to have to purchase a couple more.,1
5,I have trouble finding good bust support in swimwear but this one is perfect.,1
2,"No stress to check at all.  That can mean more cotton less elastic but elastic is important in Sox.  Fit , comfort are priority but more cotton means breathability and foot health. My feet are great with elastic though and I would not buy these again.  No stretch at all.",0
2,"I was very disappointed in these pants, I ordered burgundy and blue. The first thing was the large waist band with apx. 1/2” of elastic. These pants are more like something you would buy at a bargain basement clearance sale. The second thing was the placement and style of the pocket. I opened one package excited to try them on and would not wear these to the bowling alley. I want to return them.",0
2,"Dress has modesty placket to lie beneath the buttons that run the length of the front of dress, but the dress came so completely wrinkled I would have to have it professionally steamed or ironed for it to lay right, I returned the dress.<br />I was looking for a Hawaiin style dress and this made me think of cherry blossoms.",0
3,This thing hurts. Don’t get me wrong…as long as you stand up and be still you will be fine. If you have to walk it slides and don’t have to sit down. It digs in. The material is hard and pretty inflexible. I have tried several different times and it just wrecks my skin. I have even tried it over a tank top so it won’t rub my skin. Just not good.,0
5,Great quality!,1
3,I weigh 117 lb and it was snug but not uncomfortable. However even with low heals (boots) the dress was too long. The material is a little stiff and not sure if it would have shrunk if washed/dried. The color was spot on. Lastly it made a weird crease by my hips (maybe because I’m too short?),0
3,love the look and feel of these blouse. too bad it runs REALLY small. I normally wear a size XL in tops but ordered this in 3x to have plenty of room. It JUST fits and afraid that after it is washed it won't fit.,0
5,Works great!,1
4,"It is a tiny bit smaller than expected, but not so much that it isn't wearable.  The only thing I'm not a big fan of is all the straps that cross in the back, but still a nice bathing suit for the price.",1
1,This dress is horrible! The colors are nothing like advertised and this will be going back! Send what you advertise! Deserves no star but that's not an option.,0
5,Very nice and beautiful piece! It adds nice flare to the event!,1
5,"Nice, clear eyeglasses for me!! Love it!  Will buy again.",1
1,The charm came off almost immediately. I love the way this bracelet looks but can not wear it anymore since I don't know where the charm is.,0
2,Looks cheap,0
5,Great fit and just what I wanted for my exercise classes.,1
2,sadly these run small. they are asian sizing so I would make sure you are well aware of that,0
1,Received it today and I’m very disappointed. It has a hole.,0
3,"the bag was smaller than I thought it would be, I thought with the price it would be a standard size.  I will not use all the time.",0
1,"I followed the size chart and ordered the correct size but they were so small that I couldn’t even get them over my ankles.  Not even exaggerating.  I’m a small woman at 5’3”, 125 pounds and these were waaaaaay too small, even for me.",0
2,These sweatpants were great the first couple of times I wore them. Very comfortable and fit as expected. After washing them only twice they started to pill really badly. So unfortunately they are very comfortable but I would no longer wear them in public as they look very scraggly now. Again this is only after 2 wash cycles in which I followed the directions on the tag for how to properly wash them.  So I’d say these are good as comfy lounging pants and nothing more.  Don’t expect pants you can wear in public after the first couple of washes.,0
1,These shirt are terrible terrible terrible!! The XL is at best a medium and they are cut wrong!!! Highly do not recommend!!!!,0
4,Real nice ties for the $. They look and wear very nicely! Good buy!,1
3,"I like the shape and the built-in belted waist oh, but the fabric was so thin it showed every little flaw in my bottom. I will wear them with just the right panties and they will be cool and comfortable but I would love to have the fabric thicker.",0
3,It’s very beautiful and fits well. Be careful with the back slit. It rips very easily. When you get it go ahead and resew it. I wish I had!,0
3,Not all loose like the picture. Smaller than expected.,0
5,runs a bit small i’d size up,1
1,"Product came in with stains on the hood, seams were coming out, and product did not match the images depicted in the description.",0
5,Very forgiving and comfortable,1
3,this is very hard to get a credit card out of the pockets,0
5,Perfecta,1
5,very cool,1
1,The plastic by my camera broke. Also the plastic came off the sides,0
1,Very very small. Product runs smaller than described. I got for postpartum after having my baby but a week before delivery I realized I do NOT want anything right squeezing me during I know I won’t want anything squeezing me after. Wish product would of worked,0
3,"Very thin material is quite see through, which would probably be fine if it were a darker color and the day was not too bright. It will be ok with a long slip. Dimensions are not true to size chart, the dress is short. Definitely buy up one size if you are over 5'5"", but the bust fits as expected.<br /><br />Edit: I also bought this dress in navy from the same seller and that dress is true to size, long enough and the bust fits well, still thin material, but not see-through due to the better fit and darker color, so it feels nice and lightweight. I cannot explain why the yellow seems to be one size smaller than the navy when they are both marked as Large, but I have decided that maybe the yellow dress I got was mismarked, some kind of fluke.",0
4,Only problem i had was with the string around the weist. But i replaced it,1
2,All 3 shirts are different size I needed all to be 10 and one is 8 one is 10 and one is 12 very disappointed,0
5,"Fits perfectly, wear it during biking.",1
3,It's beautiful but not sturdy. It will break easy,0
1,"My son wore these to school only for about 2weeks, and they are falling apart. The sole is coming apart from the canvas, and on the inside, there's a piece of the fabric that is catching his toes from the top where the shoelace area is reinforced.",0
5,Sizing is good.  Not an actual compression shirt but very good for a light workout or street ware.,1
5,"Fit is good, great nerd slogan, seems to be made well.",1
5,Love this!  Comfort fit is the way to go.,1
1,Worst lens quality ever. Nice design.,0
4,I love the glasses but it continously says connected I don't like that,1
1,"Absolutely disappointed! This item is nothing like the picture.  What arrived was a cheap, poor quality cardigan. Complete False Advertising.  Do not purchase",0
2,Picture is incredibly misleading. Came with a cheap looking ball chain instead of the link chain pictured. Locket itself so far seems okay. But I'm very upset about the chain. It looks like vending machine junk.,0
5,I love these shoes. I have problem feet and I can wear these shoes right out of the box.,1
5,"My son destroys shoes, this was the first pair in a while that he hasn't totally ripped holes in after 2 weeks.  The Continental rubber bottoms have held up well.  I'm actually going to buy the next size up to have on hand for later this year.",1
5,Great item.,1
5,"It's smaller than I expected, only holds 8-9 cards max (5 in the actual card holder, plus 4 in the pockets or a few bills folded in quarters). However, the center card holder that &#34;ejects&#34; the cards is fabulous and saves me a lot of frustration when using my credit cards. I would like to have more room for cash storage, but the card holder and ease of removing the cards has won me over. A lot of people have asked me where I got it when they see the card holder function. It is a good size to keep in a pocket, the leather and snap are high quality and the aqua color is beautiful.",1
2,Perhaps it's just my ears but the post wasn't long enough for me.  They are cute and I wanted to wear these as my bed earring because without a back they wouldn't snag but they hurt my lobes too much.,0
1,This product is not white. It is more off white if anything. Like an eggshell. The quality of the hat is nice but disappointed in the color as I bought specifically for a coat that had white in it.,0
4,If you are full breasted this bra is not for you. But it is well made and I love the options they gave for the back,1
1,The socks were too small for the size they said it would fit,0
3,"I didn't like the large flower on the top, which prevents one from putting pins there. You can put lots of pins on the bottom, but then how do you put it down on a table? Sides are okay, but harder to grip the thing with ends of pins sticking out.<br /><br />I did like the strawberry emery which is good for needles, and allegedly keeps them sharp.",0
4,I have been eyeing this dress for quite some time on a few websites and was so excited to see it on amazon! I was alittle hesitant with all the other reviews about it being &#34;to short&#34; but figured with free returns I didn't have anything to loose. I am 5'9&#34; 155lbs and my measurments are 38-27-39. I ordered the Medium and it fits perfect. It does not quite reach the floor but I can wear cute sandals instead of heels and it will still look great!,1
5,This is the best brand for satin caps,1
1,"Fake, not good quality.",0
2,the pants is not a regular xl. im not sure if Hurley xl is smaller than other brands but this just isn't the right fit.<br />Very nice material though,0
3,Cute dress but too large. I'd have alterations to make. Also the back strap buttons or clasp was missing.,0
5,Very light and with a well done clip.  Key would be if they are scratch resistant.  Mine work well.,1
5,Daughters loved it,1
5,Godson loved it,1
5,I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. The quality seems to be there and she didn't try to return it. Husband Christmas giving WIN.,1
5,Quality,1
3,Too tight. Runs small. Not flattering in the stomach area.,0
3,I wish it had American measurements and a larger size so I could do large and small bracelets.,0
4,"Cute, but I thought it ran a little small.  I wear a size 6 to 8 and I felt the medium was tight in the waist area and not comfortable to wear for too long.  I then bought the large and it was a little big but more comfortable to wear all day to work for wear the traditional costume from your favorite vacation day.",1
1,I got this shirt and really liked it however I wore this shirt once and and washed it after one wash the letters started to peel off.,0
4,"Bought this for my mother, who is almost 80 and has problems seeing.She really liked this watch.",1
3,"I received this of yesterday, I ordered this in Nov. And it is not what I ordered. It has big white enamel eyes with black spots for eyes. There are no crystal eyes. Looks find of freakish. It is made well. Cool if it had crystal eyes. U be the judge.",0
5,Waiting for our flapjack shirt to complete the costume. Mr Baby (18 months) loves it.,1
5,"The dress came super fast after ordering it. It fits great. I ordered a small, and I usually wear a medium, so I think it the sizes run a little big. I feel like it is really good quality for an amazing price!",1
3,"very small, and the colors r not what they look like in the picture. the red ones look more orange",0
5,Lounging in house instead of sweats,1
5,"Great pants, incredibly versatile.",1
1,Womens Frill necklace gypsy tunic V neck Navy Blue- NOT WORTH 1$<br />Arrived on time or before expected. Upon opening the necklace for both the navy & white I purchased are scratched & worn. Material looks very cheap & is sewn poorly. The  quality is awful. The color not as pictured. I would return but received no packing slip or information in plastic wrapper. I highly recommend skipping this one & saving yourself money & the headache.,0
5,This wallet is amazing.,1
2,"I like the look of this top, but it cannot be worn without ironing, which is a drag for a cotton/spandex blend.  I am no fan of ironing, and frankly not that good at it. and this, being a stretchy material is difficult to iron. You get one area flat, and another gets creased. Very aggravating!",0
1,Ordered exactly by the size chart. Not even close. The forgot the people have backs and shoulders bigger than their waste.... I tried clearing this up with the vendor directly and was sent a self serving email.....,0
3,"The watch is beautiful and works great, however, only half of the band is synthetic fabric. The rest is black pleather.",0
5,"Very pretty and perfect fit for 9-inch ankle. The solid beaded one rides higher, just above the ankle bone, as shown in the picture. The bangly one lies below it with the pretty charms resting along to top of the foot and hanging down a bit in the back for a lovely, super-feminine effect. They are nice alone or together. I only wear for a few hours -- I don't leave them on for days -- and I haven't had any discoloration or irritation.",1
5,Nice dress. Longer than I was expecting. Fit good. Lite weight.,1
2,Not really the rain jacket material I was expecting. Very thin.,0
5,like the style and the price was better than store.,1
5,I got these for my husband and he loved them. I would recommend these squares to wives whose spouses wear a lot of suits. The colors are nice and they are made well. Very satisfied,1
1,Turned my finger green after one day,0
1,The material was very scratchy... not comfortable to wear to a wedding..,0
3,"The dress itself was just ok. Fit was kinda big for my 12 month old. She is tiny for age so that’s why bought the smallest size. However, I’m upset because it did not come with the head band as advertised. This was a big part of my decision but it and I feel cheated. I’m seeking compensation.",0
2,"I would not recommend. Cheap,Made in China socks. Spend a few more bucks for a better pair that will last.",0
3,"These shorts are amazing for lounging around the house. Super comfy. But they are see through. I mean, really REALLY see through. So be aware if you're planning on wearing them out of the house.",0
1,The fabric is cheap. The cut is not flattering. There is no bow. It just looks like a dumpy dress on a plus size girl.,0
5,Comfy,1
1,I can't wear these things for more than 5 minutes without developing terrible soreness.  That soreness lasts up to 10 minutes after I take them out.,0
5,"The shoe was soooo cheesy looking, to where it was cute. It sets off any uniform outfit. It makes the shoe look like a cute bow-bow cheap shoe. I added knee socks to the sock, and wah-lah! Magic happened! It turned out gorgeous. I already purchased another color of the same style shoe.",1
5,This is a great workout shirt,1
4,Very nice. Well hemmed. Good size.,1
1,"These should of clearly be marked &#34;children's socks&#34;. Very upset about this one. I watched these for awhile before I bought them. I'm a size 8. To top it all off 2 of the 5 pair were snagged. Not even worth it. They are cute for little, little kids. Save your money!",0
5,I loved this necklace. My husband bought it for me as a wedding gift and I wore it on my wedding day. The only thing is it looks real and wasn't as shinny as my fake jewelry I was wearing with it. Everyone thought it was gorgeous and I got alot of compliments!,1
4,Purchased these to replace the lenses on my Costa Motu glasses.  They fit just fine and weren't too difficult to install.  Love the blue lens look.  Minus one star for the very slight distortion.  Not enough to give me a headache but enough to notice.,1
5,"I love this bag!! I commute on public transportation,  so I needed a good bag that fits all of my work items, including my lunch that I pack everyday.  I've been using it for over a month, it's very durable,  practical and it looks nice, looks more expensive than it is! I recieve alot of compliments on it too. Very happy with my new bag!",1
3,"Print was good and what I expected. Runs small, so the XXL fit like other XL hoodies (likes them baggie).  But being polyester, it beads up quickly.",0
1,No really a fan of these insoles. They just feel very uncomfortable in every shoe I've tried so far.,0
1,it was horrible,0
3,"Buy bigger than you normally wear, soft",0
3,pretty tight.,0
5,So cute and very flattering.,1
2,very cheap and thin --not what i expected at all!,0
5,This dress fits well should’ve Ordered a bigger size up Definitely going to order another one in a different color,1
5,Great quality glasses! Just like the picture,1
1,Thought these were super cute and even seemed to be good quality. Well only a couple months and they have all turned copper colored. I wear mine everyday but these are definitely not the quality for that.,0
1,Very small and flimsy,0
5,I love these! Have all my friends wearing and ordering them!,1
1,"Several weeks ago I ordered (2) Rolf's replacement ""D"" credit card windows. I was sent a much cheaper version sold by Buxton which was the wrong design, too large to fit my Rolf's wallet and not what I ordered.  When I requested the specific items I ordered, I was informed that MENSWALLET no longer carried the Rolf's version which they advertised on AMAZON and they would take the product off AMAZON.  They refunded my expenses but I really wanted the ""D"" replacement windows.  I can only believe what MENSWALLET communicated  to me:  that they do not carry the authentic Rolf's product.",0
1,The necklace broke the first time I wore it...the strand broke and the pearls slid off and went all over the floor!,0
5,"Will order again, fast shipping",1
5,You don't have to be a punk rocker do enjoy this leather bracelet. Wasn't sure about the style at first but when I received it.. it's so well put together that it's not cheap looking at all. The whole thing is based on two leather braided straps there about 5 millimeters each put together with looks like stainless steel adornments. The clasp and Hardware in the front are all highly polished was no defects. If you don't like it the manufacturer does have a warranty..so it can be returned. I did order the 7.5 which runs a little small but most of these bracelets online are usually too big. I have repaired the bigger ones by using heat gun pulling off one of the ends trimming the leather and  epoxying the end back on so it's a perfect fit. This one I might try the opposite where I can pull the end clasp and fill with epoxy and make the size slightly bigger. Please don't do this if you don't know what you're doing..but it is an easy fix if you have the right equipment. The magnetic clasp makes it easy to put on and take off and seems to hold well when being used. Overall I think that this bracelet is worth giving it a try. I did receive this product at a discount for a fair and honest review. I hope this will make your decision in buying this product. Thanks for reading.,1
5,Material very soft and fits nicely.,1
5,I lose my glasses all the time and at this point getting two was perfect for me and my husband.  No worries about lost glasses now!,1
5,I love this dress for the price.,1
3,"I got the rings  blanks,  but NO cabochons...I need those sizes to finish this project.  HELP",0
5,Easy to clip onto your glasses and great eye protection from the sun.,1
4,Good gloves to small but good one nothing wrong with them thanks,1
3,"They're stretchy so they'll fit broader thighs but the heart gets stretched and distorted. Doesn't look right. They are also pretty long, but I am only 5'3 so a lot of clothes are too long for me. Lol",0
5,Very comfortable.  Does not cause back pains like other styles. Stayed comfortable all day.,1
2,The color is not like the picture. The pink is like a dusty rose color. If I didn't need it so bad I would've returned it.,0
3,They are sunglasss. Fit my head perfectly and was color I was looking for. No long term use yet.,0
5,My grandson loves them,1
3,It’s not horrible but not as nice as the photo. I’ll probably end up giving it away because I just don’t like it on me. I wish it was more like the photo and the photos of other reviewers. I’m disappointed.,0
5,Love it,1
5,Very nice belt. Easy to adjust for size.,1
2,Too small for the size had to give them to my 12 year old niece.,0
5,Very cute and comfortable,1
5,Loved it but too small despite size being chosen based on the measurements in the guide.  Return and refund were efficient and easy.,1
1,After shower,0
1,"Lousy, breaks open easily",0
5,Awesome shoes! My 4yr old loves them and he gets compliments every time he wears them,1
5,I love this jewelry.,1
3,"Looks better on the pocture. Mine also stunk really bad, I sprayed perfume to see if it goes away",0
5,"I always though Casio was what one tossed at a kid when they learned to tell time.  The Pro Trek is not that.<br />It’s a serious sport watch with cool features: world time, automatic back light in low light conditions, analog-digital readout and solar powered.  Value for the money",1
4,Smaller than I excepted and different than picture,1
1,Cute but turned my ears green.,0
1,Didn't like it doesn't fit right,0
5,It's perfect,1
1,"I bought these earrings for a Halloween costume. To say they were a disappointment is an understatement. The bananas face the same way which is annoying but what is even more annoying is the horrible metal used to make them. The backs started bubbling up within one day and the front image also started peeling. So now I have to print a paper, box them back up and take them to UPS. Save yourself some time and money and do not buy from this seller!!",0
3,Lenses are extremely small,0
5,So cute!,1
5,And look good doing it!!!,1
5,I love your product and will continue to wear and offer my support in the future.......siper cute with printed leggings......only one complaint is that I wish it was a few inches longer for me.....thank you for letting me say a few words and I wish you success.,1
1,turned my finger green after a day of wearing it and it was really tight but it looked nice at first,0
3,Backs not Sterling silver!! Only the back of my ears broke out once I got new back they were fine!,0
5,Works Well,1
3,It was a little to short for my 5’8 175lb frame. I like things that hit right at the knee but this came almost mid thigh. It will probably only be used to go out with my husband and not for work.,0
4,"I really like this shirt and was disappointed when it didn't fit.  I ordered a large and it was way to small for a 38D bust. I even tried it on with a sports bra figuring I'd flatten the girls down a bit and it was still too small, bust and shoulders.  I liked the length of it, the v-neck and the button front.  Was surprised to find it was a pullover.  Thought the buttons worked but they're just for show.  Bottom line - really nice shirt but just too small!",1
5,Great.. No I mean perfect.,1
3,Very thin material and see through. I only wear these with shorts over them or a knee length dress.,0
5,Good.,1
5,"Outside of needing to wear leggings or shorts underneath, it's fine. That's the part that sucks!!!",1
3,"The item itself was nice. I ordered 2; 1 for me and 1 for my friend, to be worn as toe rings. When they came in, I noticed that 1 was considerably smaller than the other. 1 package said it was a toe ring (the smaller of the 2) and the other package said it was a midi ring. There is no way the &#34;toe ring&#34; would fit an adult toe. I ended up keeping the midi ring for me and gave the &#34;toe ring&#34; to my teenage daughter who has tiny toes.",0
5,Good,1
5,Love this hoodie!!!,1
4,"Cute, took forever to come",1
2,"i purchased this jacket for a tall(5'10) woman with long arms. this jacket is waaayyy off. it needed like 3 inches each sleeve. its meant for the short and thick body type. if they put up a size chart or measurements, then i couldve avoided the heartache of a failed gift. :(<br />The jacket itself is decent for price, though. (does have awkward suede leather smell, almost a shoeor insecticide, but that usually will go away)",0
4,"I have 2 different kinds of these hats, this one you can hear when the ears go up a little bit but I would definitely buy another one.",1
1,They broke the first day of wearing. Great price just didn’t last long,0
4,"I am confounded by something taking nearly 6 weeks to arrive but...that being said...It's a good quality piece of clothing.  It is NOT a sports bra as stated.  More like a casual bra.  The straps give too much for it to be a sports bra.  In other words...support is not it's best feature.  But, for casual wear it's great and for the price you can't beat it.  If the delivery timeframe had been reasonable I'd have given it 4 stars.<br />*Update*  It's been a few months since I recieved this purchase and I am impressed with the quality so much so that I've ordered 3 more.  Knowing ahead of time how long they will take to arrive helps greatly.  Because of the quality of the item I'm upping my rating from 3 stars to 4.<br />**Update** - my second order took about half the time to arrive as the first one.  The quality is still great.",1
1,Fell apart almost immediately. The deco charm just falls off and then ur stuck w one earring.,0
2,"My son was super excited to get these. He really liked them, too...for the first two days. Unfortunately, one of the wires to the charger/on and off button broke and the light now won't turn off.",0
5,"Perfect fit!<br />I figured my daughter would try to pull them off, but never once tried.  I guess they were comfortable enough so that makes for a happy momma! Seemed to help her get comfortable with our hardwood floors!",1
5,I was afraid I would look fat in this dress but it slimmed me down.,1
3,Wrongs small,0
5,I love this necklace and earring set and I get compliments every time I wear it!,1
4,"Super cute, the material is slippery, which I didn’t realize and is the only thing I don’t like about the pants. Fit true to size.",1
1,Doesn’t cut cleanly AT ALL. I followed the suggestions on the package and it didn’t cut through the vinyl. I finally got it to cut through on the highest pressure setting but it still left a clear layer behind that I now have to remove from the cutting mat. I tried transferring to the fabric and it won’t release. Not only did I waste my money on this vinyl but additionally my time and other materials were wasted. A refund is not enough. Don’t buy this garbage.,0
3,"I do not like the material, must be 100% shiny spandex. I like the softer material so returned them",0
2,This dress wa a cute but I felt like it fit small and didn’t work well.,0
4,"Does not block total noise, still can hear my husband snoring. They r comfortable.",1
4,"Me encanta, es muy ajustada pero de eso se trata, hace una cintura muy marcada",1
5,Love it!,1
5,"Very cute, good quality, basically looks just like the picture. Great deal for the price. I'm 146lbs 36c 5''4, and this fit how I wanted it to. Using it as a beach cover!",1
2,The color was darker than shown,0
4,Very pretty and figure flattering.  It is very long....all the way to the floor....wish it had been Tea length.  Nevertheless its very nice,1
5,Super cute,1
3,"Someone just threw it in there  like that.  You need to check your shipping.  I have still not had time to get it all untangled, it should have been a snake necklace..  Cannot believe it arrived in this condition.",0
1,Cheap. Don’t waste your money or time. I literally threw all of these in the garbage. Not 1 item was even worthy of donating.,0
5,Excellent service and speedy delivery.  Very pleased with the quality and feel of this bracelet.  I have a relatively smaller bone structure but this bracelet fits and looks great on my wrist.  I have received several compliments already from fellow yogis and yoginis at my yoga studio.  Thank you for a great product!,1
4,Love it,1
5,Super cute!,1
1,"Not a match, one pearl was round, one pearl was more flat, both with different clusters. Disappointed, these are so nice, good size, packaged well if one wanted to gift it, but not matching pearl. I Wil be returning them",0
3,One of the straps were twisted and unable to untwist due to the way it was made.,0
5,good fit,1
1,These gloves absolutely reek of dead fish. Wash your hands with soap and it doesnt go away. Not the least bit warm either.,0
2,The bands stretch out of shape over time. Purchased 2 months ago. Not worth the money.,0
5,I love these shorts. They are super soft and comfortable. They are lose and not restraining at all. I ended up buying a second pair for my daughter.,1
2,"I really loved the dress in the picture, but it didn't fit me well. The material is stretchy which is great, but across my chest it stretched so much that the black strip faded to gray (extremely noticeable and not cute). The two gatherings in the front didn't fall well either, and the waist line ended up being much higher than I wanted (a few inches below the center of my breast). I such high hopes, but hopefully it fits better for someone with smaller chest.",0
5,I ordered 3 different key holders of similar style and this one is the best. Some features that stand out are:<br />1) carbon fiber construction<br />2) locktite on the locking screw so it doesn’t easily come loose.<br />3) Allen screws for the air tag compartment so the air tag isn’t easily removed by someone else. See picture<br />4) tools included with the key holder<br /><br />I like the design for the air tag holder. The other ones just have a push in pocket for the air tag so it can easily be removed by the wrong person/thief.<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase,1
5,"These boots are fabulous, they feel just like a pair of shoes I might have had for awhile. I have had them on all day and my feet aren't even tired.  The color is a true grey, which is hard to find.  I know I will wear them alot, a good buy and the price was even better for a Clark's shoe.  A keeper!!! Also just ordered these in the black, got so many compliments on the grey had to have the black. If you've been thinking about these don't hesitate, get them now you won't be sorry",1
5,They worked fine,1
1,"Poorly made,  untrue size.  Nothing like dress pictured!!",0
5,This dress is very flattering. It’s a ‘can go anywhere dress’.  You can dress it up or dress it down.,1
3,"The bows are beautiful and material is so soft. My bows didn’t looked frayed or homemade. My issue is that they are HUGE, I could literally fit two of my 1 month olds head in it. I don’t understand how people’s newborns are wearing them and they don’t just fall around their necks. Also, my girl has a big head",0
5,Perfect! Read the reviews and ordered my size based on the sizing. It’s comfy and adorable.,1
5,I love these shades and so does everyone else!!!,1
5,This piece is so sexy. Fits as expected. The color is the same as pictured and it is true to size. Beautiful lingerie.,1
5,Really can't beat it for the price. Looks like a much more expensive silver ring.,1
3,Bought the shirt and pj combo that I tho if not said “dreams loading” but it came in as “dremas loading” I have no idea what dremas is but it was too comical! I kept the combo bc it’s only pjs and won’t go out in them.,0
5,Verás doble mala inversión,1
1,"Not board shorts, they are swim shorts.  I was surprised to see a built in bikini bottom, they fit super tight like a bathing suit bottom would, same material as a bathing suit too.  Not at all what I was expecting, and definitely didn't fit like the picture.  I'm a size 10 with narrow hips, ordered the size 10, but size on tag says M so maybe I got the wrong item?",0
4,"This is a very pretty necklace, it's a chocker and is pretty tight.  So keep that in mind, it's still a chic piece!",1
3,Can't really see that this is helping on my rides.,0
4,This shirt is so comfortable it has now become my new favorite (the one I wear too much and the wife yells at me for lack of imagination).,1
1,Picture doesnt show good clearance,0
1,"You get what you pay for. Very cheap, low quality necklace. The clasp gets stuck open, meaning it occasionally comes unclasped without my noticing. The bird is so tiny you cant tell what it is unless you're close. Not worth the return costs, but I wouldn't buy another one.",0
4,"Just the right fit for fitness band,and with accessory tools. Nice, and shipped quickly too.",1
5,So dope fits well,1
5,Happy 1,1
5,Great quality! Loved it.,1
3,tight around the middle...seems to be cut for athletic build.  Fabric is soft but does not feel as warm or comfortable as most cotton fabrics...would not purchase again.,0
3,I bought this gift as a birthday present for my husband. The weight was way too light for him because he has bigger wrist.,0
1,Not nice at all.  Definitely regret buying it.. I threw it away because it was just not good....,0
2,This dress is just not as cute as the picture. It's very large and not fitted. The material is strange as well. The print of the fabric looks cheap. Returned this.,0
1,Not great quality and was seen crooked. So it sat really poorly on my body.<br /><br />Would not recommend.,0
4,The material feels and looks good,1
5,"I am 5’2 and 112 lbs. I usually get a small in yoga pants, but the small was sold out, so I ordered an XS and prayed they wouldn’t be too small. They fit PERFECTLY!! If I would have ordered a small, they would have been too baggy.",1
5,"Super cute !  Bought this for my 13 year old daughter.  Not too short, fits great! Thanks",1
2,The straps detached on 3 out of the 4 purchased the first time I washed them. I will have to hand sew them if I want to continue to wear them.,0
5,They shipped really fast. I love this brand and all the other styles they have as well. I'll definitely be getting more in the future. You can't beat the price.,1
5,Not sure,1
4,"Does its job, great value. Nothing special but still functionally sound",1
5,"This is another item that I found out about by watching Amazon favorites videos on YouTube. I have purchased 3 so far. I keep 1 in my purse, another one in my school backpack, and the third one will be in my work bag. They are nice and compacted plus they don't take up a lot of room in your bags and give just enough little to find what your looking for in your bag. I plan on purchasing more to give to my friends for birthday or Christmas presents",1
4,Looks really cute! Does seem to stretch a bit while wearing in humid weather. Does get piles after only a few washes.,1
5,Exactly as described.  Fit perfectly. I would order from this company again!,1
1,"These are very cheap and thin, the design is not woven it is printed on.  The stripes on arms are screen printed.  I would not recommend at all, and I would return if I could.",0
2,It was wayyyy too small,0
1,The small font isn’t even printed fully and the large font is even blurry..<br />don’t wait the month for this one. Pay the extra $5 for one of the better versions.,0
5,Great,1
3,The bracelet was smaller than I expected but still was beautiful until it turned my wrist green.,0
1,Just don't flattering on me. It was cheap material.,0
4,"Very nice comfy socks, but too big for my feet. I wear 6½ shoes-so if your feet are rather small, think again.",1
1,To small,0
1,"I love the size, look and feel. It's a really cute bag.  I've had it less then one month, used it on one trip. It's coming apart. The zipper stitching is tearing, the butterfly in the front ripped, the ""leather"" is coming off. Disappointed that you can only return if it's ""unused""",0
3,"The shoulder &#34;pad&#34; is just a stiff piece of plastic with spikes for grip, so not very comfortable, but is still perfectly functional.",0
5,Best leggings/workout pants I've bought.,1
5,"great watch, i buy it as a gift and everyone loves it!!",1
1,"This is the worst dress I've ever ordered. Unless you're a broom stick, don't order this dress. It shows every wrinkle and lump on your body.",0
3,Love these socks! So soft and comfortable.<br />Update: I've only had these 4 months and already have holes in the toes of a couple pairs - not very durable.,0
1,Too expensive,0
3,"Cap is okay, it is very thin which I don't like as it doesn't feel like its good quality. I got it for free in exchange for a honest review. I will not be using this product. It might work okay for others, i prefer one that’s better quality.",0
2,Dress looks great  in pictures and is tight on,0
2,"Very cute if you’re into rainbow shades, although they were a lot small then you’d think to me they aren’t really oversized...",0
5,Excellent quality really impress and fits as expected. Bought size small,1
4,"I loved the largeness, over sized style, but I didn't like the cut in slightly at the bottom. I am usually a small/Medium, and I got a medium, I would order again but in a large.",1
5,They are no slip no show socks. Comfortable and easy to put on. I ordered white sock set and the black. I wear for working out. Great gym sock that stays on your feet.,1
3,Fit was great. Shirt was thin and the bow fell off the skirt after 10 minutes of wearing it.,0
1,Order up sizes,0
5,Fit as sized and so comfy!!! Love it!!!,1
5,Soft neopreme and nice color combination.  Very pleased with purchase.,1
5,Will need to place some type of hem at shoulders sleeves are to long and get in the way but other than that love the shirt I bought x large bought another size large to see if it fits better just to let u know the size smaller fit great!!!!,1
3,I wish it was a bit longer in the back.,0
1,"The socks are listed as being Warm Winter sock. These are not warm winter sock. They are thin like regular every day socks. I was expecting them to be thick at least around the foot area, but they are not.",0
5,better quality than I thought it'd be.,1
2,Sizes run big so I look frumpy in it. I got a large when I usually wear medium and it is too long and baggy. Not sure if I'll wear it or give it away.,0
4,It said medium size but they were larger than I thought but they are absolutely beautiful!!!,1
1,This watch band didn't last three months before it literally fell apart.  The band started to tear at where the quick release pins were inserted.,0
5,I love how it looks!! The packaging was thorough and the product wasn't tampered with or damaged!!,1
3,No comment,0
5,Love how it looks like the characters. Just wish it had professor snape,1
2,"Being 5'4&#34; and 175lbs, I bought the size 14 because I'm a consistent 14, but the torso was very short. The best line feel right below my breasts, which I thought was odd because I am a short woman. The bathing suit itself seemed to be made well with good material, however.",0
1,Tried to return both cheaply made shawls. One had return QR code but the other made you print return label eventhough both going back to same vendor. Ridiculous! Will never order from this vendor again!!!,0
2,"The seller reported that buyer could claim a “Free gift” with purchase, however did not provide an operational email address or link. I have tried to reach out to seller but no response",0
3,Pinches your toes!!!,0
2,"Before ordering I measured both calves to make sure they would fit. Unfortunately, the 26-inch size was not true to fit. My calves were 21 and 22 inches. Sadly I had them on while flying and could not get them off. As a result, I have some scars from where they were digging into my leg. Maybe one should order a size larger.",0
4,The necklace came when expected. It looked just like described in picture. It goes well with casual outfits.,1
5,Awesome quality!,1
3,"Not as flattering as it is in the picture.  Great length and breathy material, but it did not look very good on.",0
1,Super frumpy does not compliment a woman's body,0
5,"Love wax jeans, comfortable and cute",1
5,Love this piece! Great price and fast shipping.,1
3,The posts didn't fit very well and I lost an earring right away. :-(,0
5,I have received several compliments this is super cute.,1
3,The side seams are a bit puckered. They do not lay smoothly. disappointed!,0
4,"Very cute and stretchy, but you'd have to knot it to fit a baby's head.",1
5,Has soo many pockets. Love it. Waist band dont budge to much make sure u get ur size or higher. Anti pantsing proof!,1
5,Wife said &#34;I love it very well made sturdy.&#34; So must be good !!,1
4,Comfortable. Fits well.,1
1,Cheap Halloween super thin material.  Was really disappointed!!!  I am returning.  Super short..clingy.. cheaply made.  For a Halloween party / costume  sure.  To wear out... absolutely not,0
5,So pretty and easy to breathe through!,1
5,Work great.,1
5,"These are my new favorite jeans - I read the comments and was unsure if I made the right decision because they’re so 50/50. They’re trendy, flattering and so comfortable. I double checked my measurements and they fit like a glove!",1
2,Very thin material that will not keep you warm. The stitching is very low quality and the thread color is black. Which makes it stand out from the blue and white fabric.,0
5,Perfect!,1
3,Cute but they scratch too easily.,0
3,Really like the material but the vikings part started coming off within a month...,0
1,"They say they’re comfortable, thick and padded and it’sa bag lie.<br />I got my order today and it’s the most horrible material and quality I have ever seen. I’m returning them. It’s so frustrating trusting the description they give about the items they sell and they make money with items that are not worth. The fabric is super thin, the soles are not padded and don’t have the anti slippery foam soles",0
5,Nice watch,1
5,"Works great!  They have been on for 3 weeks now. My daughter can slip on and off, while still keeping her feet secure while wearing.",1
5,I bought  this coat  for my brother and he really  love it immensely said it was warm and very warm I would recommend this coat.,1
2,"For $13, this is a fun little mystery bag.  I didn't expect much and I shouldn't have expected much.  I received 2 dresses and a skirt.  I generally don't wear either so this was already kind of a let down but everything ran so small, I wouldn't be able to wear any of it anyway.  For the record, I am 5'5' and 115lbs so I ordered small and I have to wonder if medium would have even fit.  The quality of the clothes is okay, maybe a little better than I would expect for the price.  In the end, I donated everything but it was a fun experiment and if you are more open to skirts and dresses than I am. this could be a huge success.  Just remember to order up at least one size!",0
5,cover for arms.,1
3,They were super cute ….<br />But break easy … only thing that I still have are earrings.,0
1,Color was not what it was exspected,0
5,So adorable!,1
1,It says tight fit and it was approx 3 sizes too large . Pants are see through,0
2,"The concept of this is great. The execution could be better. One of my clips has already broken off. Also, they are not strong enough and shift easily, making the door hard to shut. The other day, for no reason at all, one of them just slid right off of the door. Still have no idea how that happened. I think metal clips would be better for this.",0
5,Love the color & bling,1
1,It came with the bottom charm backwards. Not even worth returning to get a new one,0
2,Cute but I ordered up a couple of sizes and they were still too snug around the middle and pockets are placed in a position that is very unflattering.,0
5,Great dress,1
5,Great product,1
1,"Wow, how disappointing. Arrived dirty and missing a button. I’ve always loved this brand but I was planning to wear this to a party tomorrow, this really takes the cake!",0
3,I bought the purple one to check the quality etc. it is soft and flows and has a good weight to it (unlike the photoshopped import ones) and more than exceeded my expectations so I ordered the red one 🥺 VERY DIFFERENT. It feels like it’s made from the same material as the plastic scrubby side of a dollar store dish sponge. I was wearing it when I started writing this review but had to stop to take it off because it’s making my body red and itchy.,0
5,Beautiful. I get compliments when I wear this necklace. I dropped my red one and had to glue ithe crystal heart back into the cage--no problem.,1
3,"Cheap to buy and cheaply made. Finish is OK, there is a weird &#34;bump&#34; on the wrist that appears to be intentional but feels a bit awkward. All of the fingers are the same length, so the pinky finger is a bit too long and partially covers the knuckle. But they do keep your hands warm without interfering with your dexterity, and they are affordable enough to be practically disposable.",0
5,"I have worked with various stiletto tools for quilting & sewing including bamboo and the purple Thang.  This stiletto is easy and comfortable to hold, the sanded point really does grip the fabric to help hold it in place ant the pressing tool on the other end is very convenient.  This is my new ""go to"" and only stiletto I will use.",1
5,Fast delivery wonderful in packaging and are comfortable.,1
5,"Great product, thanks!",1
2,"Much lighter weight fabric than I was expecting, so it's very see through. I feel like I need a full slip under this. Beautiful design but pretty low quality.",0
1,unimpressed. breast region could have fit 2 small dogs while the bottom half for me great. fabric feels cheap and came crazily wrinkled. not worth having to return,0
3,I purchased this wallet because my wife needed a new wallet to go with her purse. The one thing I liked the most on it was how many compartments it has as well as the various colors it came in. The little dove symbol was a cute touch on it. The only issue we had is that we there were quite a few writing on the wallet that went into the design. Here as the little message are great they are just really hard to read. All in all it seems pretty durable.,0
1,Weird fit.  Returned.,0
4,Its an okay pair of sunglasses.,1
5,Beautiful top...I highly recommend and the color goes with all..from jeans to work,1
2,The reviews were great and it was cheap so I bought them. Maybe I should of went up a size but I got a size L and I weigh 150lbs and am 5’1 size 38D. Maybe I should of got a xl. It’s was long and all the buttons kept opening. I washed it once and wore it again and then two of the buttons fell off while I was at the trampoline park with my kids. It was cute while it lasted.,0
5,Good fit for my 4'11.5&#34; height. Love the fabric. Wears comfortably!,1
5,The material and design is nice and the price is very reasonable.  Didn't move or shift on my head during my 12hrs at work. I would purchase again and recommend this product.,1
5,"I bought 40+ of these for our workplace and everyone has loved how they fit, I would buy them again for sure!",1
5,These are nice and roomy.  Feel good.  Fit well.  Wash up nicely.,1
1,Runs small cheap material not as colored,0
5,Pros:<br />- Slim design<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Had the leather smell for a while,1
3,Too small.  Not too regular US sizing.,0
2,"There was a tear in the thumb stitching on each glove. One was at least an inch long through the stitches. The other was less noticable. Still useable, and would have been nice otherwise. Lack of quality control.",0
1,"The fabric was a pretty color, but it is that rough polyester material that reminds me of my grandma's dresses.  The dress was also huge!",0
3,"Way way way too big.  The dress is gorgeous and totally worth it (material, design) but it's way bigger than expected and the zipper sucks.",0
1,Color was much brighter than pictured. Incredibly ill fitting and cheap looking. Returned immediately,0
1,Too long,0
5,they work correctly as long as you dont have the water hot or leave it in hot water 2 long before molding it,1
1,Not worth it to me.  You get what you pay for.<br />I guess I am spoiled by the CEP brand.,0
5,"Very nice,perfect!",1
5,"Once I figured out the correct size, the shirt was great!",1
2,"This is not a sweater. It was skin tight, spandex garment",0
5,I am absolutely in loooooooove!! I bought this dress for a church event and got so many compliments❤!! I was afraid that I ordered too small **one size up**but the fit was perfect!!! I will definitely be ordering again! ❤❤❤❤❤,1
1,"Eventhough I bought a size higher per the chart , it didn’t fit. too tight in the chest, please update the size chart to reflect the actual measurements of this dress",0
4,"I'm typically a size 6-8 in tops and usually order a small or medium depending on the brand.  After reading the reviews regarding sizing issues, I chose two sizes up and pulled the trigger on the XL.  Egads.  Wrong move.  While the fit was better through the chest and shoulders, I was swimming in the mid-section of this shirt.  This is not a problem I typically have since my tummy is my problem area.  I loved the print and the fabric felt fantastic.  The length seemed great for leggings.  I will try to size down and report the results, but I'm worried the stomach area will still be a problem.<br /><br />Update:  I ended up needing my typical size - medium. Not sure why everyone is suggesting to size up.  Medium fits size 6-8.",1
3,Looks okay but was not what I expected,0
5,Great product! Nice quality!,1
1,Earrings were flawed and stems were bent,0
3,These leggings are very small and become slightly see through. Not bad for the price you pay,0
3,Much smaller than expected. You can barely tell it’s a cat on the earrings. Good price though.,0
5,"I bought these gloves for a Cruella Deville costume and they were great! The gloves arrived quickly after I ordered them and were in good condition. The gloves were a little loose on my arm and scrunched down sometimes, but overall were perfect for my costume.",1
5,Beautiful setting....I use as my &#34;travel jewelry.&#34;,1
1,I was surprised at the size of this scarf.  It is entirely too long & wide for my likings.  I am tempted to sew it into a skirt.,0
5,Gucci Fan love this bag,1
2,Broke easily and color is fading,0
5,Get Large if you normally get XL...runs large but one size down.. perfect.,1
1,They sold them stating they weee unisex. Nope ladies 100 present.,0
5,Perfect Valentine gift for my sweetie!!,1
2,"Sizing info is not accurate.  Description says one size fits most teens, but it is WAY too tight for my average sized 9 year old.",0
5,I bought it for my daughter. She forwarded me the link for this item. If arrived in two days. She said it was exactly what she wanted.,1
5,Awesome love da color,1
5,fits great. love the material other than you will get snags in the material guaranteed. it's kind of frustrating but still cute. for the price I really don't care. I have ordered a TON of these types of printed leggings and THESE are by far my favorite.,1
5,The item fit fine.  It was used for masquerade party,1
2,"Zippers are not heavy duty. If too much pressure applied when closing or opening, zipper will snag",0
1,The around was correct. However the cups were maybe a C and I am much bigger. Cup size matters and should be included in the description.,0
2,"Cute colors. And it was a tad difficult to place but I did love them...for about a week. Then my nose was super red, tender and puss was just flowing. Once I removed the ring my nose was fine in a few days.",0
5,Work great!,1
2,"Within a week or two of purchase,  threads started to come off the sides of the wristband.  Within two months, the Velcro pulled away from the strap.  It’s only a wristband so we repaired it with needle and thread.  Very disappointed!!!",0
5,Perfect fit,1
4,I reallly really loved the look of the top but when I first tried it on it was too big on me. Even though it says unpadded mine came with pads but I was able to remove them and the top fit me perfectly then! It's pretty good quality for the price.There was a little tear in mine when I received it but it was easy to fix with some sowing.,1
5,This backpack is a great tool for travel. Easily open it up and throw in the items that you need for an impromptu day trip.,1
3,They were too tight had to return them,0
1,Horrible ! I bought XL and they are too small for me!!!,0
5,Very nice and pockets everywhere even inside..,1
1,Very cheap! The inside ripped as soon as I tried to put a credit card in it!,0
2,"I could not get the attached metal buckle to close, even when I placed it on a firm surface and put my entire upper-body strength into the effort. I had to use a big screwdriver as a pry bar to release the attachment closure part of the buckle so I could try putting the included plastic buckle on. That worked, just. The metal buckle as designed can't be used with this thickness of webbibg. Perhaps it would work with a thin soft cotton webbing belt.",0
2,"HUGEEEEEE watch I did not expect though.  Massive... looks average quality, works average quality.  You need to be a big guy to wear this one.",0
5,Got it for my friend she loves them,1
1,Item is not as shown in pictures.,0
2,Cute bra if it was anywhere near my size. I even sized up times two.,0
1,"I just received this product and from 40 lights only 3 works. I cant believe this product has so many good reviews if is the worst product I ever bught in Amazon. This was for my daughter's bday party that is on Sunday, and now I have to run to buy something else. So dissapointed.",0
4,"Just what I was looking for - only reason it didn't get five stars is I find myself in half-link territory where it is slightly too big with one more link and slightly too tight with one less. Went with the looser option and the fitbit reads pulse and heart rate fine.<br /><br />Speaking of links, I found the adjustment tool intuitive and easy. Would agree that the instructions are limited, but it is pretty intuitive. I adjusted it several times, adding and dropping a link twice without problems, no bending or breaking a tool or pin. Since you're working with small pieces, I do advise a light touch and patience with the &#34;hammer&#34; provided - 5-6 light taps rather than trying to knock the pin through the table with one big whack.  Have to imagine that one hit approach is the only way to bend or break the tool.",1
5,Very pretty necklace.  I sent it to my friend as a gift. She likes it. I just don't know if it will last or if it will tarnish quickly.,1
1,Buckle broke the first time I put them on. Decided to upgrade to sidis!,0
1,boots way too large . gave them to friend.,0
5,"These cosmetic bags are cute, seem well-made, and were a great bargain.",1
1,The air chamber of the shoes was punctured,0
5,granddaughter.....AGAIN!,1
3,"This backpack is really very nice but the straps move all the time cause there are two in each side and you have to adjust the metal to change the lenght but it just slips all the time so you need to adjust it constantly. It also slips from the shoulders to the sides all the time on the move. That is why it is not that nice. Otherwise, its perfect.",0
5,Wears well and comfortable golfing,1
5,"Great slippers, my wife loves them",1
3,These are not polarized like I thought they would be.,0
3,Seemed a little juvenile when it arrived and I saw it in person. May be good for a teen.,0
3,The shades were not straight,0
1,"Feels like it will fall off, disappointing",0
5,I order a 13.5 even my daughter wear size 13 and it fits perfectly,1
5,Enjoy to use them. Give two friends the other two sets.,1
5,Arrived on time and look exactly like online photo and fit perfectly. Love them!,1
3,It didn’t fit me well on the top or bottom so I returned it.,0
2,Ya better know your size because you will not get a refund that includes return shipping.,0
5,I am very pleased with my purchase.,1
3,It's meant to be fitted. I was looking for it to fit like a t-shirt.,0
5,"Purchased for my son and he loves them. They do not look cheap and are sturdy enough for daily wear. Have not seen any scratches on them yet, and he does not keep in case.",1
3,"Light weight, not so much sturdy or durable. The inside material tore right away. The zipper gets caught.",0
3,Very hard to get on,0
5,Very nice- especially for the price. Wore it to a dance and received many compliments.,1
5,I have given these ties to my husband and he gets so many compliments on them.  Also they are a great gift.  The company is great I had a problem and they answered right a way and ship quick with great packing.  I say every man should have at least one art tie in his wardrobe.,1
3,"I bought two of these masks and even though they are sold in the USA, it turns out that they are actually made in China.  A bit misleading if you were wanting like me to buy ones that were made in America.  I have bought other washable masks that ARE made in the USA and will be using them first.",0
5,Very nice,1
4,A bit small but nice,1
3,"The style didn't fit me like the picture. I think if you are slimmer it would, but I am 5'2 140 lbs so the placement wasn't for me. That being said, the fabric was nice, it looks professional and I have bought about 10 Homeyee dresses so I would definitely recommend their clothes.",0
5,"This is the fourth pair that we have purchased. They are made well and for the price, I can have one in each car and one in the house.  Highly recommend.",1
1,Nothing like the picture!! This dress is hideous!! Don't waste your money. The pattern in this dress looks nothing like the picture. 😞,0
5,So damn fun. Followed the previous reviews and sized up - so glad we did - fits well by sizing up.<br />It’s not high fashion but it obviously not meant to be.... let’s be honest let the tacky Christmas wear reign!!,1
2,I’m a busty person so the size L fit short. Size up for a better fit.,0
5,Fits well,1
2,"Was really small for me (adult) and I don’t have a big head at all. So tight that I couldn’t possibly wear this comfortably. Fits my 4 year old perfectly though! Sadly, I bought 4 of these for adults.",0
5,Love these pj's. Wish I could find more to buy.,1
5,Good looking and good quality  so far....thanks.,1
3,I have a thin waste but a B cup it look like if have massive boobs and I feel fat and gross this puppy flattens me out but still makes them look like boobs,0
1,Shorter than I expected. The dress smelled badly of smoke. I returned it.,0
5,Love these!  I would definitely buy again.,1
5,I love my new evil eye lanyard. I purchased it to hold my casino membership card. It makes me feel lucky! No bad karma when it is in hand.,1
5,"Initial glow of the dial is intense. By 8 hour mark, you have to strain a little to determine  the position of the hands, so I'll call legibility ""almost"" 8 hours.<br /><br />100 meter water resist. Day and date. Thin. Very comfy. Nice execution of the dial layout. It delivers above the price range. You don't expect any watch in size to weigh that much, but this seems even lighter than expected.<br /><br />The strap is serviceable. I expect most people will replace it with a NATO or RAF style, and I did.<br /><br />You seem to get more than you pay for with this one.",1
2,"The watch is pretty and it fits my tiny wrist on the last hole.  However, I didn't submerge it in water but I had it on while washing my hands and now it has condensation under the crystal. I cant be bothered to take a watch off every time I wash my hands ; I just won't put it back on.",0
4,"I really love the 'Kiss Me Skinny' style jeans from Jessica Simpson.  They hug one's curves in all the right places and look amazing!  I ordered the ‘Foster Togged Lemon’ ankle jeans and was so excited to have the lighter color for the upcoming spring & summer. They feature little lemon designs all over.  Talk about cute!!<br /><br />I normally wear a size 20, but quite surprised to find these jeans were a bit too tight.  Enough so that I probably wouldn't wear them, as for me comfort always trumps cuteness. They are also lower rise.  They do not fit the same as my other 'Kiss Me Skinny' jeans.  Not sure why they are smaller/lower rise, but sadly I have to return them and now they are sold out!  I give them a four star, being super cute!!  Just wish they fit like my others.  : (",1
5,very secure; people like the graphic; great value for the pricce,1
5,"Bought for my one year old for when we are out on the lake for hours at a time and it worked great!  I like it because it fits a little loose and not tight so I think is more comfortable for her.  Arms were a little long,  but no big deal we just folded them up and they stayed!  Also got lots of compliments in this!  😊 Definitely would buy again!",1
5,I love wearing these with leggings or skinny jeans in the colder weather! And they are beautiful.,1
5,Prompt and they are comfortable! Happy with my purchase,1
1,Too small and the center stone looked artificial . Returned it,0
1,Cheap material,0
4,"Arrived in somewhat of a timely manner, looks great and feels great!",1
5,Beautiful  dress,1

1,"My daughter has sensitive skin. She wore the face mask 2 hours for a school test, and developed a rash around her month. The reason I bought this face mask was it was claimed as cotton. I don't know what the face material is, but the liner is 100% NOT cotton!",0
1,The material is nice.  Cuts up way too much ! And is too short.  Im 6'1 . The size would have fit if was longer.,0
1,Don't Buy this Item. Complete rip-off !!!  It's not worth your money! Not solid.. The clasps broke and the Chinese leather ripped! Returned the Item for a replacement..Never got anything back! I will not buy again and I will make sure that my social media and Friends know about this! over 23K in my circle!!,0
1,I specifically looked for the 400 UV coverage as recommended by my eye doctor to slow progression of cataracts. The office has a machine to check the actual UV protection. These sunglasses measured at only 66% UV coverage.<br />I am returning the product since it does not have the coverage advertised.,0
2,"The Pom looks nothing like the photo, I am comparing next to another one I received.  The hat is nice, but if you are expecting a nice fluffy large Pom, don’t purchase this one",0
5,These suspenders are awesome!,1
1,Bad quality as cheap as price.,0
3,"Made for ladies with thinner calves.  Quality is great for the price, but is not forgiving if one's legs are not long and on the thinner side.",0
2,It would be a very nice jacket if the sleeves weren’t too baggy even in a smaller size. It looks weird in the body. I returned it.,0
5,"If you need to wear a mask, might as well look cute. That was my thinking when I bought these and they did not disappoint. I have gotten many compliments on them. They are very easy to clean and comfortable to wear. Love that they came with filters.",1
5,"He wears these so much, I definitely think this onesie was the best money I spent on Christmas last year!",1
5,Received product on time as described!,1
5,Bought it for my nephew and it fits him well.,1
3,I wanted to love this dress but the stripes came down at an awkward place. The quality and material was great but I ended up returning it.,0
1,"not the material that I expected. very cheaply made and see-through, but I guess that's expected with the price.",0
5,Great band,1
5,"if you wear a size under 4 grab a Small<br />I'm 5'1'' size 32dd and it's a perfect fit (snug/like a glove)!<br />For a tad looser go up to medium~<br />might have to tailor it up if you're short like me ;(<br /><br />As for the apron it's velcro strap with a bow on one end, not for you to tie. Might want to find a way to stiffen the bow. :D<br /><br />Or get work done and find materials to make it a tie on apron.<br /><br />picture attached is a size small",1
3,I would give a five star if the draw string hole is at the right place. The material is thin but doesn’t see through.,0
1,Way to small. Maybe a pre-teen could fit into them.,0
3,Great hat for a costume only it's kinda big...like you need a huge head to keep it from falling over your eyes.,0
5,Good,1
1,I recieved the pink camo pants early and i was so excited untill I opened the package. The camo is the wrong color and they are leggings not jeggings jeans like its advertised. It was also supposed to have pockets. Im VERY DISAPPOINTED. I dont think i will be ordering any clothing items from amazon again and i will tell everyone i know about this awful experience. I should have listened to everyone about not ordering clothes from amazon...lesson learned.,0
5,Great quality and assortment of colors,1
4,Nice shirt body fit good but the sleeves are too tight. They  feel like they are sewn on wrong. im guessing the shirt is a 2nd.,1
3,Light on hat only lasted 30 minutes then burnt out,0
3,"For the price this was a pretty good deal. However, I had to take the padding out because they were Styrofoam and made a lot of noise while wearing it.",0
5,Love it!! It's so comfy and fits great!!,1
5,love the glasses,1
2,It fits ok and looks nice on my wife but she doesn't like the material that's why I returned it.,0
5,Very nicely packaged and beautiful scarf. Nice quality and good price. Highly recommend,1
1,These boots smell so strongly of chemicals that I refuse to have my daughter even try them on for fear of her getting a chemical burn. This is unexceptable and I refuse to pay $4.98 to return them. I will be contacting Amazon to fix this problem.,0
3,A size small.. 3t fits like 2t. Literally the same shirt size when placed on top of the other.,0
2,They fell apart not even a whole 2 days in your mouth. Waste of money!!!,0
4,This is a great looking watch. The world timer is a little hard to see but I am sure it you were traveling then it would help greatly of it you need to know the time in another country for business.<br />I love this watch.,1
3,Quality of the material was good but the scale of the printed graphic was way to large for my face.,0
3,Gave this item only three stars because the workmanship is great but the leather smelled of mildew. The pricing was ok but I will not be ordering any more until the vendor can get rid of the smell.,0
5,Nice ring.  Delivery was slow --- probably no fault of manufacturer.,1
2,Ask later,0
4,"This is a really cute dress. The only problems I have is that if I were taller, it would be too short (I'm 5'2) and it is very tight in the chest area. If you're large chested, definitely size up 1-2 sizes",1
1,"The overall fit, waist placement, and hem length  made me look like total goober!  Had to go back. Note: the red belt in the picture is my own, and I'm wearing a distracting pair of red earbuds (sorry).<br />The dress comes with a skinny black belt.",0
5,Great Product Very cute to wear. Can be slightly awkward ay first but one you get it on there right you will never want to take it off. Plus the sellers are very helpful,1
4,if were a little larger just if I compare with the ones I used at hospital!,1
2,I bought this for my bridal shower and it's ok. The lace is pretty and the fabric is soft but it is also extremely this. Even wearing a nice bra underneath you can see it. There elastic is also pretty flimsy.,0
2,"Silicon/rubber arms get stuck in hair.  I returned immediately.  The concept was good, just didn't work for me.",0
3,Super nice material and well made. Unfortunately the sizing was completely off!! Like daughter couldn't even get over shoulders.,0
5,It's same like picture.I like it.,1
5,What a beautiful watch the picture does it no justice.,1
4,"I love it, but the material tear easy",1
2,"This dress doesn't fit the way it should. I am short with hops, and the pocket sticks out when I put it on. I bought this dress back un 2020, and haven't worn it yet because of the da* pockets 🙄",0
4,looks like the picture,1
4,Top is thin so if you have others around you might need a tank under it.,1
1,Tiny!!!! Like for teddy bear :/,0
2,Size run small got it as a gift for my son and dissatisfied with the product representation just regift I guess🤔🙄,0
3,"Glasses surprisingly were pretty good quality until I wore them for a few days and started developing a rash where the nose pads are. Im not too sure if I may be allergic to the type of metal that they use since the nose guards are metal and are not plastic or silicone like regular sunglasses or prescription glasses. But other than that, the glasses are alright....",0
5,"After several broken elastomer bands, this fabric band is fantastic. Durable and easy to adjust.",1
5,Very pretty,1
3,Thought these were black pearl earrings but they have a green sheen to them. Nothing was mentioned about them being green.<br />I do not like green.,0
5,"I have fat lady calves, and these fit over them nicely. They are in rotation with a couple of other pairs and still in their first season of use...what I'm trying to explain is that I busted through the winter boot socks (not darn tough brand) from last year earlier this season. I walk roughly three to four miles daily. I also have the bad habit of wearing them without shoes around the house and office. Once in a blue moon it's a necessity to dash across the parking lot to a guest room to fix a tv or demonstrate the operation of water faucets without shoes (no time to dawdle and lace up the ol' boots).<br />Powerful like a micro chip. A lot of warmth in not too bulky a package. Although my boots are a half size up from regular sock shoes.",1
3,The plastic inner frame is too delicate.,0
1,"Would have been cute if it came to the knee like the model. I'm 5.1, but mine came to my shins. My 13 year old liked it, lol. My husband HATED it on me.",0
1,Nice shirt but although it states that it runs small... it runs very small. I ordered a 2XL and this shirt was about the size of an American medium.,0
2,Too tight. Feels like blood circulation is being cut off,0
5,I got these and they just weren’t flattering on me. They also have a weird smell when you first get them.,1
5,I loved the quality and is super cute!,1
1,"I waited weeks for this specific color (Moon Rock) to become available - unfortunately what arrived doesn’t match the photo at all. On the site this looks like a muted pinkish color, but these are grayish purple. So what do the ‘purple’ colors look like ..?? And somehow they’re also too big. I’m 5’7” 135 lbs and always wear a medium .. these definitely fit like a large. Disappointed and returning.",0
5,Love these glasses!,1
2,I saw in the reviews where teachers thought this was a good product. They fogged up after a few minutes and was not comfortable.,0
3,"Cute. Runs very, very small. You definitely want to order 2 sizes up. The sleeves are very tight. Nice, bright color.",0
5,Bought for my wife and she love them !!!,1
1,This piece arrived broken.  I have reached out to seller.,0
5,I ordered the lavender and paw print bands.  They are great.  It was very easy to switch out.  The color is nice and pretty.  I would highly recommend RedTaro to everyone. This is my third band from this company and their products do not disappoint.,1
3,Fabric is pretty but thin and very wrinkly,0
5,Loved so did my daughter,1
3,"Very cute- really like this but it’s a synthetic knit, not cotton",0
3,"I usually wear size xl,but this is too tight. Is there any way,I could replace it for xxl?",0
3,"I like the dress, it is pretty and it fits me very good, it is just that the material makes me feel hot during the summer.",0
5,Love,1
4,Very cute. Glad I ordered larger because it runs very small.,1
1,"Very cheap, you can see your hand through the material",0
5,Bout for a girls weekend in vegas …. purple is super cute im sure others are too!,1
1,These were so comfortable and I’m so sad that I have to return them but the camel toe was so bad. I am 5’8 and about 125-130 and I got an xs in hopes to avoid a camel toe but i think my hips were just too small,0
1,"the item is not proportioned correctly, shoulder width is small  sleeve opening is really small.",0
2,"What's wrong with this equation? Material: 47% Polyamide + 45% Polyester + 9% Spandex?? That's 101%. This shirt is nylon polyester, the real shiny stretchy kind. Was really cheap so I bought 3. I need to workout anyway, was way smaller than I expected. Not sending back but not happy about difference between photo material and this material.",0
5,"This was a birthday gift. It is absolutely gorgeous,  so soft,  colors and design are beautiful.",1
5,Love ut.,1
5,Perfect,1
5,🌞👓,1
5,Really nice wallet. Fits 1 card tightly in each card slot with room for some cash or another 1-3 cards in the center pouch. I've been using it for about a month now and it is holding up great! Great wallet.,1
5,Exactly as shown. Very elegant and nice.,1
3,"I bought the wine/red which is a gorgeous color.  However, I was expecting the sweater to be longer in the back.  It does not cover my bottom.  Not sure I like the drape.",0
3,"I couldn't tell from the photos, so I ordered from four vendors to compare.  They are IDENTICAL (except for color and price).<br />$10.89 Kilofly purse insert organizer<br />$ 7.99 Nsstar women travel insert handbag organizer purse organizer tidy<br />$ 9.99 HDE Expandable Handbag Insert<br />$12.99 (for 2) Hoxis Purse Insert",0
5,"My son loves it, fits as expected and does what it needs to do",1
5,For the price it's a perfect suit. It fits well and most important to me it withstands the abuse of chlorinated pool water. I'm very happy with it.,1
2,I’ve had this product for a little less than two months and it keeps coming unclasp and my Apple Watch has dropped to the ground and I’ve cracked my screen on it because the watch band does not stay clipped.,0
4,"I was pleased with the overall make and quality of this item, but unfortunately, it was much too small. Giving it a mostly positive vote for the quality alone, on the off chance I may have a cowhead and just not suited for hats.",1
3,The necklace is ok but I thought it would be larger.,0
1,Color,0
1,Pésima calidad no es lo que indica y el precio para calidad no refleja,0
2,"Only tight in the bust! Boat neck terrible for sunscreen! Does not wick! Probably flattering for c-cup and below women, but being buxom, I ordered by bust size as recommended, and that is the only place the shirt compresses anything! Even the sleeves are floppy, & I have muscular arms. The heathered shirt snags on everything and catches on velcro like a beast!!! The shirts have no spandex, so even if they were 2 sizes too small they would not stretch where they need to. If you are looking for a shirt to wear as a regular stretch shirt and are smaller than a D cup, and moderately fit, it will look cute. I purchased for under uniform, and it is far too loose and floppy in the sleeves and waist.",0
5,Buy it. It's super cute. Purchased for a 4th ice cream theme birthday party.,1
5,It's cute! But package is too simple. Hope one charm in one bag as least. Will come back and order again.,1
5,These are so comfortable!!!,1
2,Too short. Wish the length was a bit longer. And somewhat thin material is not as good as I expected. Can't wear it in winter.,0
2,"Im only giving it 2 stars because one of them broke as i took it out of the little ziplock bag, there other’s are fine.",0
1,I order a Small and it is way to big it fits my friend who is is a 2Xl so I wasted money on a top that I loved and now can’t even wear. Sizes are not true at all. Very upset. I would give a -5 star if I could,0
5,"nice fit, pretty color, can fit a lot of beads on item also",1
1,The skirt itself was very cute.  On my 4ft 10 frame it hit my legs at a weird spot.  I am curvy and I just looked frumpy.  Not my favorite purchase.,0
3,The color is nice and I like the fit but the stitching started coming out after 2 washes. I only wore these pants 2xs.,0
3,Liked the jacket was a bit disappointed in the liner/inner jacket was much thinner than expected did not feel it was the inner jacket would be warm enough to wear by it self. If liner/jacket had been a bit thicker would have kept the jacket. Sleeves were good length. I have long arms so is always a challenge to find jackets with long enough sleeves.,0
5,This is a great casual dress that’s very flattering!,1
5,Great value for money. Tablet fits well and there is still room for the mouse and external USB port. Makes transporting tablet and accessories easy.,1
1,"Much, much, much smaller then I thought. Pay attention to measurements.",0
5,"This is easily wearable and flattering for us bigger girls. I’m a dress size 14-16 and it’s flattering and forgiving. Like with all the Chinese clothes brands, I machine washed this on delicate and hung it to dry before wearing, it didn’t shrink. I had already had good luck with the long sleeved version of this dress last year so knew it’d be a hit. I got the black which is actually a very pretty charcoal with a hint of an acid wash vibe to the fabric. Pretty and forgiving, easy to dress up or down, does not wrinkle easily, and the fabric is a thick sweatshirt-like material so wouldn’t be great on a hundred degree day. Perfect for summers here in Oregon.",1
4,Does its job. Glad someone finally thought of this!,1
5,super comfy! Love the pockets.,1
5,It’s more see through than I had expected but it is actually so much better that way!! It’s super cute!,1
1,Sizes run extremely small.,0
5,It was great for putting on my keys,1
5,"Love everything about this purse.  The color is great, the size is great, and there are lots of compartments.  It is a rather large purse, but it is exactly what I was looking for.  I carry my flats to work along with at least one water bottle, half a bag of grapes, plus my wallet and check book, and there is still room to spare.  The straps don't slide off my shoulders as my old purse did.  The only thing that is less than perfect, it has little balls attached to the ends of tassels that click together as you walk, but these could be removed.  Would definitely buy again and refer to a friend.",1
3,Muy fina la tela,0
3,I did not like how the chain easily broke. It was too weak and breakable.,0
5,"Just got these earrings today and they are Stunning! So sparkly and beautiful and the perfect size! Not overly large and obnoxious, but not teeny tiny either. Love them!",1
2,The socks were so tight they hurt my legs,0
4,nice colors,1
5,It's a beautiful necklace! I love everything about it. Nice packaging. It's Absolutely gorgeous! This is my fourth purchase from Care & Chloe Laya Ruler and I'm always wowed! Love it!!,1
5,Love them!!!! Just what I was looking for! Love the non skid!!,1
5,"I live in Arizona but it does get chilly in December/January.  With these socks I can continue to wear my flip flops all year.  They are very comfortable, well-made and thicker than I expected from what some other folks had written.  A fun and practical item.  Enjoy!",1
5,It cozy but not heavy lightweight and so adorable love the designs. Nice stretchy waistband for comfy bottom fitting. The sizing was perfect,1
5,"Very nice material, heavier than expected so hopefully will be warm for an October Wedding in a barn",1
2,I expected the deer print to be on the entire scarf like in the picture. Instead there’s a section that’s striped. The material isn’t as good a quality as other scarfs I have purchased from this company. Would not recommend.,0
3,"Shorter and smaller than expected, but I love the material.",0
1,Item was bigger than I wanted,0
5,"They're not quite as comfy as the brand they seem to be imitating, but damn close and really comfortable...and a lot more affordable.  I'm a fan.",1
4,very nice,1
5,I love these chains. Good price and beautiful sterling,1
2,When I ordered these I thought the crystal was round as in like a little marble. The red crystals are flattened and faceted.  To me they look kind of cheap,0
2,Good for someone that work on hotel maybe,0
5,Real cute dress. I bought for my daughter. This looks so slim fitting on her. Fabric is nice. Fits as described.,1
5,Fast Shipping - Great Product,1
2,I threw this unit away. It was hard to coil and uncoil. The bag was too small with very long handles. This deserves one star but I like the idea of easy storage and hope they improve the design.,0
3,"It’s a very cute dress despite it being a different pattern than in the product photo (should be a rule against that! 😡). It’s obviously cheaply made but still plenty sturdy and very wearable. My main issue is how tight the chest area is. I am a 38C and it squishes me into a uniboob while also feeling very restricting around my rib cage. Fits great in every other area.<br />For reference I’m 5’7”, 164lbs, and usually wear a large or a 12.",0
1,"Very comfortable. Unfortunately, the first time I used the rest room I noticed a couple holes. Don't expect them to stand the test of time. Maybe not even a few hours.",0
5,Love it! Fast delivery!,1
5,"Nice product, it had quick shipping, and it was packaged quite nicely. :) Would order again!",1
2,Too big on top and pocket placement make hips appear wider. Unflattering fit.,0
2,enormous...many reviewers liked the soft fabric - i thought the whole dress looked cheap.,0
5,Just beautiful...,1
3,"The socks are warm & fit well on my feet, but are too binding on the leg part.  They put ridges in my legs & I have thin legs.",0
4,"This is a great top! Super cute and comfy but I think it runs a little smaller then what I was anticipating. Other then that,<br />Great.",1
1,"First off, material is see through.  Second, the material is VERY thin and quite cheap.  The fit is too large (not slim as advertised).  It comes very wrinkled and will stay very wrinkled.  Unless you want to iron every time you wear this item (with starch) I would greatly advise you do not purchase.  The fact that this has anything above 2 stars, is beyond me.  Take it from someone who wears business attire 5 days a week - do NOT buy.",0
2,This was a disappointment.  It doesn't even come close to fitting a 3 year old head.,0
5,excellent love the product,1
3,"Get what you pay for, cheap and chinsy",0
1,This product works but had a terrible odor that even transferred to my clothing.,0
1,Not sized as expected! Very short and SUPER WIDE! Very cheap! This was a gift and I am very upset. There is no way I can gift this! And no time to return!,0
4,This is a cute shacket to pair with jeans or leggings. It’s warm enough to wear with a long sleeve underneath. I like the way it feels and fits.,1
5,To be honest I didnt expect it to be as good of quality the size is perfect and my brothers gf loved it.,1
1,The seam in the back was very uncomfortable.,0
5,Love these shoes.  My son can't them off but he can still move around and start walking.  Great purchase!,1
5,the more you wash the better.....,1
1,Love the style but the print is only on front and when you move you see white backing on draped part. Normally wear medium but was only available in small. Fits a bit tight but wearable.,0
5,"If you are like me and have a very thin lebret piercing skin you know the struggle of finding an actual 1/4 inch stud that is an internal thread. It's almost impossible to find these! Will order many more! Quick shipping, beautiful quality, great price. THANK YOU!",1
5,Love the colors,1
2,"very cheap made,fell apart...didn't even last through the night! the feathers kept falling off of the boa,and shedding all over.",0
4,"I really like the color and details of this boy's shirt which is dressy enough to wear alone for a wedding or special event. I also like the versatility of being able to roll up the sleeves and button them in place for a more casual look. I was anticipating this feeling like one of my husband's dress shirts but the fabric is a bit rougher than that, almost like a nubby linen. It's well-made and I appreciate that there aren't any loose threads or seams which I keep finding with online clothing orders. It seems a bit narrow so you might want to order a size up depending on your child's build.",1
4,It's work,1
1,Poor quality. Not something I would wear. Very disappointing.,0
3,"This is SUPER CUTE, I love the print and the design of this item. but it has a TERRIBLE SMELL. :-\",0
3,It's a little big for just about anyone but it's fine. Everything was fine until my girlfriend noticed the links and dragon discoloring which the description says it doesn't or isn't supposed to do.,0
1,This was way too long!!,0
2,Not happy with this purchase. Shipping took over a month. The quality of the dress was cheap. Runs small. Colors were pretty but just not a good dress. I ordered another dress similar to this one and received it in less than a week. The quality was way better.,0
5,"Great price, the quality of the fabric is very good and my son says they are quite comfortable. Plus they look great, and fit well.",1
3,They give the appearance of being inexpensive in person,0
3,"I thought these were dyed beads, but they are really only covered with resin. I am still going to use them, but I will need to be mindful of the color wearing off.",0
3,"I have owned a few automatic watches, and I must say that for $50 this is the bargain of the decade.<br /><br />This watch offers moonphase day date and an Tourbillon peep all while seeming to have a decorated movement! and a display clear back so you can see the seemingly decorated rotor. All this for under $50 there must be a catch.<br /><br />Well of course there is<br /><br />You don't get the box in the pictures but the watch does exactly looks like the one on the pictures. You don't get real pushers but recessed pushers which are a pain to use (the screw looking parts next to the crown on the right side of the watch). You can use a pen or something similar to click them and switch the weekday and date.<br /><br />There is also no seconds hand which I miss and there is also no hacking. To continue with the downsides the finishing patter on the dial doesn't allows for the numbers to be painted properly or as well and you can see in the pictures some of this. Mine came with a paint spot just next to the 9 numeral and it's just a stain. At least you can barely see it but it's there.<br /><br />The crown action is horrible, there is a middle step which does absolutely nothing ( you would expect date adjustment but that is what the pusher do ). The last step allows you to set the time. The clock does features manual winding within the resting position of the crown.<br /><br />To cap all the previous points what seems to be a beautifully decorated movement or at least the rotor isn't. It's actually a decorated piece of metal glued to the rotor. If you see the rotor from the side you can see the layer of decoration on top of the actual rotor. I would have been fine with just a stamped decorated with the brand name rather than a fake decorated rotor glued on top/<br /><br />The leather strap is rather underwhelming but honestly it's a $50 watch, there are straps that are more expensive, so there you go.<br /><br />There is also a big thing for me that I didn't noticed in the pictures. The dial seems to be in 2 parts and there is one in top of the Tourbillon and that can be easier seen in person I will update with pictures later.<br /><br />Conclusion is that this is a pretty watch, for the price looks amazing works and has a beautiful decorated movement to the untrained eye but keep in mind how it really is.",0
1,Bought for myself the frames are small im giving them to my 7yr old,0
4,They appear a little lighter grey than photo but they are squat proof which is a plus. Over all comfortable,1
5,Perfect! Just what I was looking for.,1
1,Stupid,0
1,"Not cute, not flattering, material is blech, doesn't fit well",0
2,"It's not what you think if you watch Hardcore Pawn. You can't look at things up close. You have to do it from a distance which kind of takes the point, and the fun away from using this product.",0
2,"I would have liked it, but its a big big. Also, it came ripped.. poor sewing quality.",0
1,"It was a see though skirt, I didn't like it",0
5,I loved the colors of the dress and fit perfect!! So cute!! Very happy and might get a another color next time,1
3,Got two pair of grey and no black stockings.,0
3,Nice,0
3,Closure is hard to use. But it is pretty for the price.,0
3,"Blue dress with Mesh top overlay. I bought the size that correlated with my 11 year old, I had to pin the dress around the waist which was fine but what I didn't like was there was pieces of plastic/trash stuck in the mesh top that we could not get out. Dress is pictured to look like it has pockets, it does not.  Overall, my daughter was happy, just expect to make adjustments if you purchase",0
1,"Not what I expected, turquoise looks like plastic.",0
5,I wear these over my tights in the gym. Breathable and comfortable. Love ‘em.,1
5,I adore this bathing suit! It is just as beautiful in person as it is in the photos. Wore it to the beach and received lots of compliments. I am the type of person who always wears a shirt but I felt 100% comfortable in this and didn't need to. It definitely has some tummy control which is a lovely bonus.  It's a teeny bit loose in the chest area (for those who aren't heavy chested) but overall the suit made me incredibly happy.,1
4,They're great. Large enough to fit over my large glasses. The lens<br />are much better at blocking glare that my last clip ons.,1
3,This is a decent hat for kids. The construction is good but the one major thing I didn’t like is the hulk figure is just an iron on decal.,0
1,I ordered an 3xl but it looks like a size medium,0
2,smells,0
1,they got tangled up immediately and lost their gold tone,0
1,There may as well be zero underwires in this bra because that’s how cheap it’s made. Very disappointed.,0
1,"The sweater is not as pictured, the sleeve is too short. I purchased this expecting a nice loose fit but instead it’s more like a fitted look. No thanks",0
3,Colors look faded and the witness is not the same .,0
5,Love these mask fit well comfortable love the grey🧐👌🏼,1
1,The threading started coming out as soon as I washed it! It made a hole under the sleeve. Was never even worn.,0
1,"I bought this shirt in the light green print and loved it so I bought it in white.  The white version seems like a different material and the wrinkles will not come out.  I've steamed it, washed and dried it and still the wrinkles remain.  I missed my return window so I'm stuck with this mess.",0
5,"These boho style anklets are fantastic; the heel and toe reinforcements are excellent, the material looks and feels like hosiery, and the decorative ankle band, in varying hues, are quite cute!  What you see in the photo is exactly what you get.<br />I've only had these a few days, but already worn two pairs.  Great for long, hot, humid summers in TX with the light feel and if your sneaks are a bit snug, this is the go-to-answer  The top of the sock does not fall down no matter how much I move around, and doesn't bind the leg whereas I show red depression rings after removal of other types of socks.  Recommend highly.",1
5,Beautiful bag. Good quality for the price. I wish that the opening for the bag was bigger but overall it is  a great deal !!!!!,1
2,"Jersey is double-layered. Definitely not going to be comfortable on hot days. And I'm a skinny cyclist with little Tyrannosaurus arms, and the sleeves felt uncomfortably tight after just 3 minutes wearing in the house. I can't imagine how annoying that would get after 60 minutes on the bike. Unfortunately going to have to return it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Edited to add: Excellent customer service, so added a star to update from one to two. After I posted my review the seller contacted me offering to send a new jersey with the elastic removed from the sleeve. Appreciate the offer, but an elastic-less sleeve will probably flap and cause drag; and the double-layer jersey will still be too thick/hot on summer days.",0
5,"Perfect fit to size, great material. I received lots of compliments wearing this dress",1
2,It was way to big for my liking and it hurts on my nose,0
2,muy pequeño todo,0
5,I'm 5'7&#34; 191. Lean. I bought an XL if you are pretty muscular go with a 2XL. I should have. I still wear it and it fits well. I just know that a size up for 18+ inch arms will thank you,1
5,"Such a sick design, and way bigger than I thought. They also share a really sweet thank you card and photo of the person who hand made it.  10 out of 10!",1
1,"Awful!! Cheap material and fit terribly. I’m very fit and I thought maybe my but wasn’t big enough. I gave them to my daughter to try on, she’s a bit more endowed in the booty area, she said they were the worst shorts she has ever put on or around her legs.",0
3,The zippers ravel within a week of use.,0
5,"I love this top. It is so comfortable and it is long enough to cover the belt loops of my jeans! I have a very long torso so my belly button gets way more exposure than I'm happy with on any given day. This shirt covers everything, but isn't tent like.",1
3,"This is exceptionally long for a belly button ring. If your piercing is really high or you have a long belly button OR you like having it dangle in your pants zipper, this might work for you!",0
1,Way too misleading,0
5,Love!,1
1,It was so tight on my eyelids that I couldn’t open them and my nose was pushed flat to the point of looking like a pug. Sending them back.,0
4,Much more light-weight than I would have liked and a little lighter than the photo but its not bad.,1
5,I bought this for my husband. He really likes it.  He is not really into necklaces but this piece is different and is fitting for a male.  It looks good with no collar type shirts.,1
5,Comfortable and comfortable lol,1
5,Gorgeous band.  Vibrant color.,1
3,It was a little to long for me,0
1,Way too small on the ouch area.,0
2,Broke not even 1 hour of wearing them,0
4,"This dress would work best if you are layering it with something. When tied closed, the slit comes right up the middle of the dress and I had to wear a skirt underneath for fear of giving a show! The material was thin, but not see-through. I wore this for a black-tie event, but will probably style it differently for less formal occasions.",1
5,Product is durable and super cute. Seems like it will hold up great.,1
3,"I really like this concept but it isn't made for a women's head size.  Being too big, it rubs on the top of my ears making them sore and the strap doesn't tighten enough keep it secure on my head.  These would be fantastic if they were made in a women's head size!",0

The sleeves are proper length(!), and the coat extends down to my knees loosely but is not overly baggie.<br />I also purchased the Cheering Unisex Rain Coat coat in size XX-Large, which I am also pleased with.<br />The quality of this coat is consistent with the other positive reviews.

3,"Somewhat disappointing from the Helikon Brand, was expecting a more heavy duty-product, more along the lines of a duty belt, especially with the giant buckles this belt has.  The Buckles seem decent quality but the belt itself is more costume-tier.  Would work well as a good daily-use belt if you have belt-loops large enough to accommodate the buckles, which you probably wont.  No loop to hold down the excess strap.",0
5,My husband and pool guy kept losing the gate key in the yard.  They cannot miss it now.,1
2,"As a woman's, Unisex gloves were too large for my fingers. I have long<br />fingers and there is too much space between the tips of my fingers and the tips of the gloves, not effective as Touch Screen gloves, very good price and good quality though!",0
1,It was supposed to be one size fits most.  I have rather small arms and they were way too tight and too short for me.,0
2,"This product has the potential to be cute, but the material was awful and somewhat see-through. Also, I got this in the smallest size they had and the chest area was too large.",0
1,"Way too long, Im 5 ft 7. Look at the photo, that's where yore uke will sit",0
4,"I like everything and will continue to be a loyal customer and I have horrible short term memory with MS, and your reps have been very patient with me when ordering products, and I just wanted you to know that,<br />Thank you Cindy  A Haas",1
5,Does just what a wanted! Sized up one size. Also it’s held up perfectly through lots of washes.,1
5,I like it very much,1
5,"I really like these as do my 2 adult sons. One uses them as a daily work shoe in the office, the other just around the house. I buy new pairs as needed, mine last a bit longer because I do not wear them every and all day, just for basically in and out of bed and sometime padding around the house. These are really great.",1
5,"Super slow shipping, but the wallet is definitely worth the price.",1
5,Nice quality.  Exceeded my expectations.,1
5,Took off about 2 links with tools included and fits perfect. I have gotten so many compliments about it love rhw feminine touch.,1
1,"It wasn't adjustable as stated in the description. I pretty handy and comfortable putting things together or adjusting them. Unfortunately there was no obvious way to remove links, and no direction included. The pins to install the band were not inserted in the band, just loose in the bag and a tight fit. I'm not sure if I would have been able to actually install the band. Sadly, I'm returning it.",0
3,Uncomfortable. Would not stay up on my legs,0
5,it was very pretty and i love sailor moon so i loved it.so first it was to big and so i tried to tighten it but i couldnt so we looked up a video and we watched and it worked so five star review,1
1,"Bonitas pero, Súper incomodas para trabajar, lastima mucho Arriba del tobillo, están muy duras para agacharte, malas para trabajar , no las recomiendo",0
5,great value!  leave it under the light and it glows in the dark. bought as a gift for my friend.,1
5,Nice for Christmas but I plan to use it through the year too.,1
5,I use it for embroidery and sewing it holds down cuddle fabric while sewing sew easy,1
1,"These are not leggings in any way, shape or form.  They are so sheer that you could see my panties through these and the dress I was wearing over them.  Do not buy these if you are expecting to get a solid pair of leggings that provide any type of coverage.",0
2,"Bought these as a gift for someone for Christmas. It was a nice addition to her charm collection....or so I thought. Sje said after a few weeks, not only did it change color/fade, but shortly after, it broke off her bracelet.",0
4,I'm 5'8&#34; and 180lbs- I wear a 14 jean and a 38DD. I bought the 2x because I wanted it to fit my bust and didn't want it to be too tight under the arms. Got my wish but there's about 6 inches of extra material around my ribs and the overall effect is a swing rather than fit and flare.<br />Construction is decent and the cut is cute. Fabric is sturdy with a huge amount of stretch. Should have bought smaller.<br />Handy with a sewing machine so I'll nip some darts into it.,1
4,"When you compare this to Sperry Topsider or Ughs, they are excellent for the price.",1
1,Great looking watch but consistently falling minutes behind...,0
1,The pants was a 2X but the shirt. Must have been in youth size. My youngest son who wears a small couldn't even put it on.,0
1,The material was corse and the shirt was huge. I bought the item as a gift (off the gift recipient’s list). The seller offered to refund 20%. I did that instead of the hassle of a full return.,0
5,beautiful. fit me perfectly. it’s little tight at first but if you walk and sit with it for a few mins it gets better and your body just adjust to it. i love it. exactly what i wanted,1
5,Bought this for my son and he loves it. He wears it everyday.,1
2,"When we opened these, they are NOT children's socks. My daughter (who wears a size 4)  put one on and the heel went above her ankle and the sick went to her mid thigh and she is tall. The color orange they are seems more neon than I had hoped. Never got to use them as they cost as much in postage to return as I spent originally.",0
3,bought for grand daughters,0
1,"Beautiful dress, but both the product and the subsequent replacement product were ripped at the top of the slit. The flare sewed onto the dress is not sewn well. Return window seems to be for the original product, so I couldn’t even return the replacement. Construction seems to be sub par. Replacement arrived a day before the event, so we ended up at Dillard’s spending 4x as much on a last minute dress.",0
5,Tons of compliments.  Great fit.,1
1,Size chart is way off. I ordered an XXL for my Father in Law who is a 38. They were way too small. The cost to return is very expensive. Would not recommend this seller.,0
2,Teeny....,0
5,These are not very large but they are absolutely beautiful! Looks expensive!,1
5,Great gift for a friend.,1
1,"They do not look like the picture, the proportions are totally off so it doesn't look like a shark. It made me laugh how terrible they look compared to the photo. (I'll add a pic when I have a chance). I recommend finding a different company to buy this product from, or pass.",0
2,They weren't for me,0
4,"High quality, but was expecting more of a light peach color instead of bright orange.",1
1,It came with holes in it. I will never purchase again,0
4,It’s. Mask,1
1,No support,0
4,"I love this bag and have bought it twice. Both times the strap has broken when i was out and about. I would get it again but i will bring it to someone to strengthen the straps connection points before using it. This bag is a great size and holds a lot (which is probably why i have broken the strap twice). The actual bag part is strong, no rips or messed up liner. Love it",1
1,This is just a thin tank. It provides almost zero compression.,0
4,Kept me warm all day!,1
1,"This was a present and it arrived much too late, also the opening for the ponytail is too high (not as shown in the picture) meaning if one carries ponytail in the middle back of the head one has to pull the hat totally back hence the front is not protected.  Sorry but that's not what it should be.",0
2,The led lights on the black skirt are red blue yellow green not purple blue green like in the pic. They do not match the shirts I got to go with them.,0
3,"Cute, overlay is itchy for me and very long even with wedge sandal.  Should have sized up to a large.  little tight in bust.",0
5,This is a very nice looking watch . The picture here does not do it justice .<br /><br />This is a very nice looking watch . The picture here does not do it justice . You can find better pics elsewhere . The face has a 2 layer look and the center has light vertical stripes .<br />It is a large watch with a large pretty face .<br />I found a video on how to remove band links on youtube .,1
5,"I was very satisfied with the quality of the dress. The chest and waist is very flattering and stylish. I did not take into consideration about the length because I am only 5ft, it fell below my knees. With the help of my mother we shortened it about 4 1/2 inches and it is now right above the knee. It didn't take away from the pleets and the material was very easy to cut and hem.",1
5,"These glasses are AWESOME! I bought these for a two month bike tour that we will be doing with our kids in Europe. Not only do they fit my 2 year perfectly, they are built so that they will stay on, with the arms gently hugging the head through the genius rubber connector piece. After my daughter played with her glasses for a bit, I heard her say 'uh oh, I broke them', and I was so disappointed, but when I picked them up, I saw that due to the rubber connector piece instead of screws, it was easily slid back into place with no damage done! The arms of the glasses are secure and haven't fallen off again, although I've taken them off several times to show friends. Couldn't be happier!",1
5,Even better than anticipated!,1
1,"This was absolutely disappointing. I ordered this two weeks ago and it got here today. I opened up the plastic and a moldy smell immediately hit me. I touched the fabric and it felt damp and sticky. The color doesn’t look tan but more like a yellow brown. Returning it immediately, it was so gross I didn’t even want to put it on my body. Sad it didn’t work out. The item photo is deceiving if this is what it actually is supposed to be.",0
1,The cut is bad. Not worth buying. Very disappointed,0
2,Cute but entirely sheer. Should have cost $5,0
2,I must have a small head because these are too loose for me to wear.,0
5,"I was very hesitant to order in Chinese Man size. My son is very average size 10 year old boy. I was very impressed with the quality and how great it looks. Seller was very helpful and communicative and even include a little gift.  I ordered 2xs for my barely 10 yr old boy and it fits perfect, not much room to grow but can definitely wear it for a good 6 months or more. I paid extra to have it shipped faster and it made it on time. Will definitely order again. Customization is great. My son loves having his jersey with his last name.",1
1,They said corduroy....but the material was horrible...like plastic..,0
3,Very nice material - wrong color.,0
5,"They are pretty great quality and seem durable and that they will last for a great while. And they look pretty good on the shoes I got them for. Couldn’t be happier with the quality, and price.",1
3,"This sweatshirt came out of the bag identical to what's shown online so I was super stoked ablout that, it is very soft inside but the fuzz comes off super easy on your shirt so beware.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is absolutely zero stretch to this and the stitching is slightly tughter than the material around my bust causing some unflattering lines through my chest, I have to wear a sports bra to avoid that. I recommend sizing up if you have any personal issue with showing your love handles or back rolls, it shows every curve dip and slope my body has and I ordered my true size. Im 5 foot 6 and 190lbs slim waist but I have hips and tits so this size issss juuust barely workable. Also after wearing for a few hours it got little lint balls under the arms  so im not sure how long the life span of this will be. I like it but probably wouldnt buy again.",0
5,"So after I ordered my two colors, apparently some customers received theirs. I immediately tried to cancel my order. I was so upset with the reviews. Well , I just got mine. I’m really impressed with these. It is as close to the apple brand as I’ve seen. This is my third try at this type of band.I don’t see why all the Meg reviews.The material is a “little” different. Not as stiff. The adjustment buckle is near the same . The finish on it is very close to the apple. The only complaint is that the connectors are a bit shiny. They fit nice and snug. I will keep these until apple makes a black one. The starlight color is very close to apples. They both look like a big band aid around your wrist. The green one is the apple",1
5,Cute gift purchased for a teen for Ariel Grande concert.,1
1,Just got the dress and its huge. I'm not a tiny person but you could probably fit 2 of me in the dress. I got a medium according to the size chart. And too much material. Not the simple black summer dress I was hoping for,0
2,"Looks great, but it's really small for the computer.",0
5,"Absolutely perfect! I shopped all over, at the best stores, and couldn’t find anything even close to this. Will definitely use them agin! Fit couldn’t be better. Fast. Fabric excellent.",1
3,"It is a nice leather bag, I just could not get past the sharp edges of the zipper.  When you put your hand into the bag, they are like teeth.  I wish the strap were a bit thicker as well.  Great otherwise!",0
5,My face is small and most masks didn’t fit right. This one is a much better fit as it goes under my chin and I feel more secure. The bendy nose piece makes the fit perfect for me. It is washable. It is light weight and has a slight stretch for the comfortable fit I was looking for. Finally found the mask for me.,1
5,Good product  good quality,1
5,I love this dress and it looks really sexy on me,1
1,"They broke after the first wear. They were a gift, very disappointed but you get what you pay for!",0
5,Fits cute and looks cute. A little long but could be because she curls up lol. I would recommend!! Love,1
1,It’s cute but it’s not what I ordered. It’s not the 3 butterfly bracelet I was expecting.,0
2,Cheaply made & very thin. These shorts show cellulite and are not flattering. Keeping to wear around the house but definitely not wearing these in public.,0
3,"bought them for a halloween costume, they work perfect for that, but they aren't super quality or longwearing",0
3,nice if you have a smaller face not a big face love them,0
2,"Nice shirt, but way, way too large.  Sizes not true.  Husband usually wears 2XL and XL fits him fine in this one.",0
5,Beautiful!,1
2,not very happy with the finish of this item.  Marked 925 and does seem to be sterling silver however it has the look of stainless steel.  Not a very nice finish on the piece.  I was disappointed and ended up buying from a different vender,0
5,Love them gotten so many compliments and it comes just as pictures & sturdy,1
2,"Tag says army green, color<br />Is clearly brown. Really people??",0
5,It protects the medallion and you can fit two in it with ease I keep my 24 hour coin and my month coin in it.,1
5,Fast shipping and product is excellent,1
3,"I like it alot and I'm going to keep it. However, where it says ""long"" robe and in the picture it comes down well below the knees,  it comes above my knees. Not short, but not long. But I like it anyway and going to keep it. Feels nice.",0
2,Band size ok.<br />Cup is huge and not comfetable,0
5,Hot these for a sock party and they are perfect for the gift,1
5,"wow I love these earrings so much! They are lightweight, big, and the color is beautiful. I’ve gotten so many compliments! Definitely going to ge more in different colors😄",1
2,Received the item and it has a hole.,0
1,Way to short. And I'm 5'5'',0
3,This wallet is smaller than I thought but it's very good quality. There's tons of card slots which is always nice. Plenty of space for cash and coins. The gold writing on the front is not what shows in the photo on mine. Mine says Your Choice which looks a little weird.,0
4,"I was expecting these pants to fit me either a little too long or too tight. I am 5'1 142 lbs and have wide hips and a big bottom. But I went with my usual size of 10 and they fit great on the legs too. They are tiny bit tight on the waist but will loosen with time/weight loss. My only complaint if you can call it that, is I am short so these are somewhat long on me. I can hem them myself though. Which is why I hope they offer different hems. More colors would be great too!",1
4,The shirt was true to size and very soft. The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because of the picture. There stem of the pineapple wasn’t green at all but was the same color brown as the base. I was pretty disappointed when I saw that.,1
5,"got it quickly<br />have worn it several times,no sharp edges<br />very comfortable,well worth it",1
3,"Nice sweater, but sleeves r all too short, fits like a 3/4 length on me. Had ordered 3 colors. All too short. I have to roll them up another cuff and make the length look deliberate.",0
5,"very comfortable, true to size. I like the quality of the shirt and the feel. Most of the time these shirts will last about three years.",1
1,Cheap flimsy looks like a sock with ear pieces on each side ridiculous!,0
1,"This was horrible, and is an ackward fit. I do not recommend to buy this. I got it for my Bachelorette weekend at the beach and it came in the mail and I packed it and went on my flight. Once I got to try it on it was bad and not worth the money, I want to send it back but it's too late.",0
3,"The band itself seems very well made and very nicely finished.  However, I did not see myself going to the major work to resize it.  I do not have the tools necessary to cut or grind the mesh links.  So I returned it.",0
5,Stunning and worth it.,1
2,Received Saturday. Wore briefly Sunday and to school Monday and Tuesday.,0
3,It was ok,0
5,Son frescas y muy cómodos,1
3,"This is such a cute dress, but when I got it, the top was a little snug around my ribcage and did not feel comfortable for me. These pictures always make dresses look like they have an hourglass figure themselves, but in reality, it just hangs straight down... probably because I don’t have an hourglass figure. I am very straight from shoulder to hip, and I thought the waist line would help me have a shape, but it only accentuated my tummy because the waist line was too low on me. I am only 5’1” and 125 lbs, but I guess this was made for taller people. :’(",0
1,"Definitely looks better in the picture, but it's more of a style for older (35+) women than it is for younger women. The bust line is too high and isn't shaped right. It is NOT a sweetheart neckline, it is a bizarre flat sweetheart that makes the shoulders look wider than they actually are. The shoulders also aren't fitted right.",0
5,"For the price it is super! It has held up amazingly well, and is flexible and durable. Looks fantastic and didn't cost an arm and a leg. Came fast and in good condition.",1
1,"I give this a 0. This is not a dress it is a shirt that fit my 10 year old daughter who wears a kids 10-12. There are not pockets, the material is not right the colors are not right. If you are going to show a picture of a dress you can make at least learn how to make it.  Not happy at all with this purchase. I have emailed the company a few times regarding the purchase and they will not respond. Never order from Merry mou store that's for sure",0
3,Fits small,0
4,"My daughter loves the fit of these! They are super soft and stretchy. They wash perfectly and the bright colors do not fade. I just wish that I could find more options to order individually or to choose which patterns I am purchasing. In many of the 2-pack order options, one pattern is great and the other is...meh.",1
4,Es pesado Muy pesado,1
5,I like them,1
1,"This fabric is so bad.  It is 100% scratchy polyester and super thin, you can see right through it when you hold it up as you can see in my first pic.  It's the kind of material that catches on any piece of dry skin it hangnail you might have.  Ugh.  Mine also came with these weird seams in the back.  No where in the pics for the item does it show any seams in the back.  I can't attest to the fit of it as I'm not going to bother trying on.  Sending back.  I think the only accurate thing is the color.",0
5,My son loved this! What a great Christmas gift! One of his favorites. It’s very unique and of good quality. Keep them coming screenshot!,1
5,Comfortable to wear when working out,1
1,It broke immediately.,0
5,Very pretty!,1
3,Adorable well made dress that unfortunately runs way to small!☹️,0
5,Love it,1
2,The mask was a little small for an adult face,0
1,You better order 2 sizes up,0
3,"Returned: I really liked this dress. It was discounted so I thought I would try it. I typically wear a medium so I ordered a 3XL. It fit fine on top. I am 5'4"". It was too long. Even when I added 3"" heels, the dress still touched the floor. I loved the color and the material. The straps were kind of strange and took me a minute to figure out. This dress was not for me, but I think it would be really cute on someone a little taller and possibly more slender. I discovered that I have too much weight in my middle to pull off that much of my back showing. :(",0
5,This is a high quality scarf. It became my boyfriends favorite scarf as soon as he put it on. It feels like a warm cloud on your neck. It’s super soft and falls well. Great for dressing up or just everyday use.,1
4,Fits well. Comfortable. After a few wash and wears it gets stringy along the hems.,1
1,These are running extremely small I ordered a extra large in the red and they fit fine did the purple are extremely too small and also the way I have a 2X and they’re extremely small ! White Red and purple ???,0
2,Not as sturdy as I would have liked....,0
1,Do not buy this product!! It isn't what you see in the images!! Very very very poor quality!!! Do not waste your time or money on this!!! There are no rear pockets as depicted in the images!!,0
3,These are VERY THICK headbands. Much thicker than expected.,0
5,Excellent quality shirt.Will definitely purchase more from this seller...Super soft and comfy cotton tshirt..noth the stiff scratchy cotton tshirts you get from other sellers!!,1
3,I really thought this jacket was great at first. I purchased in January and barely a few months later the main zipper fell off my coat. I was just on a walk with friends and I heard something hit the ground and it was my zipper. Very disappointing as now the jacket is a little useless but would have loved it if this didn't happen.,0
5,To comfy and soft. And they ARE NOT see thru at all. And they wick moisture very well!,1
5,"I thought 48mm would be a very large size. But it is not. The watch is very beautiful, with excellent finishes and a bracelet with micro-adjustments that facilitate a perfect fit on the wrist. Despite its size, the watch is not thick, which allows it to be worn perfectly with clothing.<br />Inside it has a Sellita SW200 movement that works very well, with at least 30 hours of power reserve. The luminance is OK, but it is not the best.",1
1,Does not apply for Amazon return policy.  They expect you to pay return postage.  It took forever to get product in first place then it didn’t fit after using their size guide.  Not worth all the trouble to exchange or attempt to get a refund.  Extremely frustrated,0
1,Do not buy this item. It is really bad quality and not worth it. You are able to get a better watch else where for a cheaper price. When trying to return you will not be able to get all your money back. The seller only gives you 2$ back when you spent 40+ for this wack watch. Do not give this watch a chance. It may look cool is not worth the money. Do not buy !,0
5,Love these earrings!,1
3,They seem impractical because so bulky. It advised they should fit tight and expand over time. I had been afraid they might be too small,0
1,Pretty but cheap.  Broke within a day after I bought it.,0
4,good quality,1
5,This is the perfect summer dress.,1
5,Nice padded sock for hiking,1
5,love these for the little one!!!!!,1
2,Did not like the fit. They kept sliding down.,0
5,This was a beautiful dress. Arrived as expected and fit as described. Perfect.,1
1,I would like to return theae googles. They suction around the eyes very tight however leak. Do not like thwm and missed the cut off because i was out of town.,0
5,Great shorts for mountain bike and hiking.,1
1,It was amazing at first until days later it started to turn black. It was horrible !! I can't even wear it at all !!,0
2,"Really well made, too bad it didn't fit my baby.",0
5,These unfold and fold easily. They also carry well in pants pockets with no damage.,1
1,"I can’t pin point exactly what was wrong with it. It was not flattering at all. I am 5’2”, 125lbs. I ordered a small. The neck was beautiful but the rest of it was not flattering. It felt too big and loose.<br />Returned it.",0
3,Beautiful dress however too tight at hips and split a little too high for me.,0
5,Small but cute,1
1,"These shoes must have been knock-offs from the real Chinese Laundry brand. The box smelled like a tire factory when I opened it, the straps to the shoes were extremely flimsy, and the fit was completely off. There is no way these shoes are truly a product of CL. Buyer beware!",0
5,"Fits perfectly, will buy in another color!",1
3,"Cute, but dug into the front of my girl’s legs if it was pulled up to cover her top half all the way.  Based on the size, the suit should have been a little big on her but it was almost too small.",0
5,Depending on how your weight is carried you could almost size down one size,1
4,Cute and very inexpensive.,1
5,"Love this top, it's super comfy and looks great! I usually wear an xl (16), but I sized up and didn't need to. Slightly sheer, covers the booty, and the buttons don't gape in the front. Buy your size and enjoy 😊",1
1,Really looks cheap,0
5,Beautiful dress purchased it for a friend's wedding I got many many complaints.,1
4,Looks amazing and fits great. Having a problem with the zipper in back. It’s stuck half way others would give 5 stars!!!,1
5,Great product!,1
5,"Best sticky bra I ever used! I’ve been trying new sticky bras, searching for a good one, and this one is definitely the best one. It stays stuck for the whole night long, and even after that it was still very sticky, I’m sure I can use it again multiple times. It’s totally invisible, and it fits perfectly.",1
3,Order a bigger size.,0
1,"Epic fail...I bought these socks for Tough Mudder, They were supposed to keep my feet dry, Unfortunately that didn't happen, and what made it even worse, my feet were constantly in a puddle within the socks throughout the event. Save your money because they won't keep your feet dry like they're supposed to.",0
3,"It was a very nice ring, until one of the stones fell out last week. I purchased it in February and only wore it when I wasn't at work. (I use a regular band at work). Not a good shelf life.",0
1,"I bought three colors- red, black, and grey. The black and red fit like they should and I love them. The grey is a completely different size! It’s almost twice the size of the other two!",0
3,Smaller around the thighs but still comfortable.,0
1,The wallet falls apart as soon as you go to use it.,0
1,This dress arrived is cute but it came stuffed in a plastic bag with so many wrinkles I returned the dress!,0
5,Perfect! Exactly what I expected.,1
5,Fits just as expected. Well made and very comfortable.,1
5,Just as seen on the photo which is exactly what I wanted! Such a cute coat.,1
1,Something is very awkward in this shrug :(  The collar lies crooked...It simply looks a mess!,0
1,I was sent the totally  wrong item! Super bummed because I usually really love this brand!,0
5,"This suit fit perfect! I am 5'3&#34; and about 150 pounds so I typically wear a size 10. Looking at the size guide for this suit, I selected the US 8-10/Asian 3XL and it fits absolutely perfect. I was hesitant to order this suit at first, since a price that low usually means poor quality but there are no issues with this item at all! I have read other reviews about color bleeding, however I have not worn this in water yet and have not washed it yet so I cannot attest to that. But I CAN say this suit is super cute, very flattering, and will allow me to walk around the waterpark with my son without feeling self conscious all day!",1
5,Love it very much,1
4,I would size down a size if you want a flowy fit,1
5,Gorgeous just what my friend was wanting. Perfect for a drag queen.,1
1,"I've had this watch for some time and I feel like now is the time to do a review. Great looking band aesthetically. However, the clasp that buckles the band underneath continues to come apart on its own. Very weak locking mechanism. If your hand move suddenly or something as simple as clapping, your bracelet will come undone. I cannot recommend this item.",0
1,didn't fit right on my boobs tight around arms and i had xl,0
5,Happy with purchase,1
1,Your orders mouth hit my chin and my beard stuck out did not fit well on any part of my face but it is a great looking mask just big and not flexible at all hard plastic molding strings to attach did not work well becouse of its size of my face,0
5,Gifted to a friend she loved it.,1
2,"Wore them once, then washed them. The zipper broke and the button came unsewed. I was pretty upset by the poor quality, because these are pretty comfy!",0
4,"Wasn’t as soft or flexible as I thought it would be since it said rubber frame.  Other than that, it’s good.  Lenses are truly polarized as they give you a little card to test it.  The kids think little card is the coolest thing since you can’t see parts of the picture until you put on the glasses.",1
1,"I’ll fitting, look like cheap Old Navy pants that are straight cut.",0
5,Good fit and good material. Received many compliments on the design and colors,1
5,Perfect!,1
3,"Well.... Bought this for my 49 y/o hubby on his birthday so he could look like he was somewhat in style. I know his size so purchased this for him. Now picture this..... Our family sitting on the couch as he goes to try on all his new clothes. He hollers from the hallway and says “Ummm, did you shop in the teenage section? I don’t think it’s supposed to look like this” I say “Just  get out here babe!  And here comes my poor hubby looking like a sausage ready to explode! One sneeze and he would’ve looked like the “Incredible Hulk” after his shirt was shredded! I fell on the floor laughing and the rest of the family couldn’t stop laughing either! I pretty much peeled it off of him and wonder how did he even get it on??? Thank goodness we can laugh and not get offended! Needless to say that shirt was stored for anyone who could fit into it (it’s still stored lol). The material was nice and the pattern was pretty kewl. Although we haven’t used the shirt it was worth the money because we laughed ourselves silly! FYI: Be smart and order larger lol",0
5,They are lightweight and wonderful sunglasses,1
3,"I returned this chain because it was just blah. It wasn't attractive or pretty in any way. Though it was well made. It was on the longer side, which was nice and probably would be perfect for someone else.",0
2,Size is snug,0
1,"These didn’t look as pictured to me, I sent back ! Was disappointed ! Short, boxy, no shaping at all , just a mess !",0
4,"If you plan on wearing them for more than like 2 hours, I’d pick a different pair. The clip makes them really painful.<br />But they’re really cute, and sturdy.",1
5,"I had to buy one of these just because I love the simplicity of these watches. It was delivered very quickly. I've had it now for a little over a week now, and everything is exactly like the pictures and description. I'm giving it 5 stars because for $10.50, I couldn't imagine a better value. I own &#34;nicer&#34; watches to wear when I dress up, but this one will see plenty of wrist time.",1
1,The worst fitting shoe I ever owned I wore them once and now I have to give them away. They would not stay on my foot felt like I was going to fall all the time,0
5,Great goggles for contact lens wearers.,1
4,They are beautiful. Got a much bigger size & glad I did cause they fit with just a little bit of extra room. A bit narrow. Have a plastic smell to them that is strong.,1
5,"Such a cute dress. It’s much shorter than I’d like but it’s seriously beautiful. Soft pretty material and not see through. It’s above my knees and I’m 5 feet 4 inches. Weighing 187 pounds, I ordered a large. It’s not tight at all. Bust 38/ waist 33 /hips 49. It’s gorgeous.",1
4,"It's an amazing robe, no question. The material is delicious and you can really wear it all day if you want. It is a bit large and I have to roll the sleeves up a few times if I'm making coffee or breakfast, but to lounge and read and nap, it's wonderful. Highly recommend for lazy days.",1
4,It’s lovely I hope my daughter enjoys it,1
5,It just doesn't work with a pendant I purchased it for.,1
1,"Product very cheaply made. Fell apart the first time I wore it. Tried to fix it but chain kept breaking in pieces. Finally just threw it away, not worth trying to find a new chain. A waste of $8.99.  Also, much smaller than pictured. The item pictured is twice the size of what I received.",0
1,This product looks nothing like the picture. It is cheaply made with a cheap faded patch that was ironed on crooked. The fabric is very thin. Doesn't seem suitable for an infant. Very disappointed. Seller should not charge customers a shipping fee for returns.,0
4,For the money I thought it might be a little nicer.  Works though,1
4,"This is the second one I purchased, it’s really nice but the bra top and head band needs to be crocheted a little bit wider.",1
4,Super cute top. Lightweight but not see through which is nice. Simple and one of those you can dress up or down easily. It also washes nice. I didnt have to iron it after hang drying which is always a plus!,1
5,Great suit. Got a lot of compliments,1
5,Very fast shipment and Outstanding Quality on Product.,1
1,Sorry to say the white stockings I received were not new. It looks like someone had already worn them and didn't wash it afterwards.,0
1,Super uncomfortable and very cheap plastic,0
4,The top fit great as a medium but the bottom was almost an extra small. Had to give it to my 8 yr niece to wear.,1
3,Nice pair of  eyeglass frames but the style did not fit my face well. I returned them.,0
2,"Cheaply made, too small everywhere, had to return.",0
2,"These glasses came early but, they messed up the lenses. The pink ones had blue lenses and the blue ones had orange lenses. I did not even bother to send them back because they looked fine. The blue is darker than what is shown in the picture. The frames of theses glasses feel cheap but not like they will brake if you drop them. The hinges are stiff as well. When I dropped them the reflective coating scratched a little and they are hard to clean. I ended up giving a pair to my niece who is 8 who loved them. She said they are grate for dress up and her friends think the are cool.",0
3,Discoloring on the white trim that goes along the zipper. Also a few of the zipper pulls fell off. I wasn’t expecting a ton for $17.00 but I was hoping for more than that. I can fix the zipper pulls but not the discoloration. I ordered blue and red.,0
5,I was worried it would not fit.It fits just fine an actually stays on while Im sleeping,1
5,It was good quality but I ordered wrong size,1
5,Exactly what i was expecting.,1
4,"The quality looked great, but it was way too large even though I ordered the size I always wear. I wish I had time to try a smaller size, but I needed this for a trip.",1
5,Me encantaron😍😍 están divino mi princesa está muy feliz con sus zapatillas✌️,1
5, ,1
5,Product came quickly and fits as advertised. Looking to buy another color now.,1
3,barely stays open on it's hinge. also kind of annoying to open. looks great though.,0
1,I not a real coach bag look at the pictures same bag but very different quality I bought the bag at Kittery outlet order same thing on amazon because it was cheaper so not a coach different color and quality don’t bother real coach bag for 40.00 more absolutely better quality,0
5,Gave my granddaughter the opal earrings and she loves them.,1
3,It is too small but it will do.,0
2,Somewhat flimsy material. Kinda blah on top & boring. But super comfy. A little clingy in unwanted areas.,0
4,"Love the top, fabric is very nice.  I normally wear an XL but this seems to run small.",1
2,The dress is nice and sits very well. However there is no underlining and so it is completely transperant.,0
4,The neck is large. Just ok for me.,1
4,This is a good gown.  It is standard cotton and I was hoping for something exceptionally soft but that is not the case with this product.  I am a size 8/10 up top and a size 12 below and the Medium fit perfect.,1
1,Tarnished completely in 1 wear,0
5,I get some many complements when I wear this watch and people are shocked when I tell them how much it cost,1
5,Wore this to a Christmas work party. Loved the lace and how it fit.,1
3,To heavy,0
1,It's literally an oversized white-beater... not very impressed at all.,0
2,Not very darkening.,0
2,"Nice for just a fitting tank top like heat gear kind but not slimming or compressing as said in description. My husband's 6""2 and 220lbs and first ordered a large and it was big on him.  Then he got a small and it still wasn't slimming at all. Just like a heat gear shirt with a bit of elastic in it",0
1,Otherwise it's a great style of buckle/belt mechanics and the material the belt is made of is great so I will be replacing the buckle to extend the life of the belt.,0
3,Earrings are shiny and very beautiful. Perfect size for me but too heavy,0
1,Dress is purple and the feathers are blue.,0
2,"So, the strap looks good and is well made.  The major problem is that it does not ""grip"" the glasses, but will slip off.  Also the thickness of the strap makes it somewhat painful after extended periods. I would not be comfortable wearing in windy situations or on a roller coaster.  I am pretty sure it would fly off and you would lose the pretty strap AND your glasses.",0
5,It was what I wanted loved it!,1
4,Because of my job (working in an institution) we had to use clear bags to transport our personal belongings so this bag came in handy,1
5,Pretty,1
5,Really happy with quality of this item and price.  The color was exactly what I was looking for and having a hard time finding.  Nice box for gifting.,1
3,"Very Very tight fitting, almost hard to move in.  Order a size or two larger than normal pant size.",0
2,"I purchased this necklace because I wanted a long one but the one I received is shorter in length than what was described. It is also different than the picture. The pendants are placed opposite on the chains. Also, the metal had damage in some areas.",0
5,Warm & very well made!,1
5,"Machine wash on DELICATE in a garment bag. The straps will wrap around the agitator and stretch, ruining the dress. :(",1
2,Kind of crappy material and the pads on the inside do not match the size of the bra. Probably great for someone with A-B cup chest but nothing bigger,0
1,"Although the bows were a wee bit smaller than the other's that I've ordered. I like them, they are cute!",0
4,nice watch,1
3,They are very pretty but shrinked<br />a lot and faded after a few washes,0
1,"If your intensions are to use this to communicate with those who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, this is not good.  It smashes the face and makes it uncomfortable to wear or communicate.",0
1,Very very small fit.,0
4,Decent coffee.  I like Lavazza slightly more.  Nothing earth shatteringly good about either compared to any other respectable brand.,1
5,"Cute, and fits well",1
1,Can't believe I wore this twice and look at how the buckle destroyed the tan section of the belt.. I want a refund..,0
5,"Fit is exactly as sizing chart. Comfy and stretchy material., doesn’t ride up. Especially like the coverage of bottom and top zipper... gives sports bra a finished look. Well made.",1
4,Cute bag does the trick!,1
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. Mesh was very scratchy, no design to the actual bra. An ace bandage wrap would’ve been more comfortable and flattering.",0
3,It fits a size smaller. I usually wear medium but M/L was smaller. Very tight fitting,0
5,"The bag is pleasant and joyful to use. Great color of bag and ornament. I like the belt and the carabiner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems that this model of bag is no longer available in the model range and for purchase from the manufacturer. And I can't understand it. This model clearly stands out among the monotonous and banal other sleek bags in black with white ornaments. For this, the manufacturer gets a conditional minus from me. I do not approve of this decision to remove this bag from the model range.",1
1,"I loved the style, but the fit - way too small.",0
5,"Gold, comfy, light weight!",1
2,Not as expected. Baggy. Cut is not flattering at all. Adding a belt in desperation only made it worse. I returned it.,0
5,Not too big or too small,1
1,the colour is not good,0
5,"I really took a chance on this necklace not having many if any reviews, but I took a chance buying it for my very ""hip"" niece for her birthday LoL! She absolutely loved it!! So thank you so much! Got there a day before her birthday as promised!!",1
5,gorgeous ring!,1
2,"I bought a 2xl but it fit like a size medium and it was also short lengthen, like a cropped shirt.  I gave it to my wife to wear because she's much smaller and she Saud she could wear it over something and it only came down to the top of her pants.",0
3,"Well, I was prepared to love this shirt.  The fabric is nice, color looks great, stitching is well done -- a good look.  But then I put it on.<br /><br />I usually wear a medium, but I got the small from looking at their size chart (I have a 40"" chest and a 32"" waist).  The result is simultaneously too small and too big!  It's fine around the waist, but the chest is too small and it's tight across the back.  So you might think I should have ordered the medium, but it's actually a bit large in the shoulders!  By that I mean that the seam where the arms connect to the shirt are out past my shoulders a bit, as if I had ordered a size too large.  I've never had this problem with a shirt before.  And it seems uneven -- the right side is worse than the left.<br /><br />It looks like others are having better luck than I am.  Perhaps this is just a one-off mistake???  Other than that I would really like the shirt.",0
3,I’m 5’9 138lbs.  I got the large for the length.  Was a lil big and still a lol short for me.,0
1,"Advertised as 130 cm but actually only about 115 cm - yes, including buckle.  Sent back",0
1,I am a size 7 and after one wear they slip off.,0
1,transparent,0
5,Exactly what I expected...complements the day I wore it.  The watch is definitely worth the investment & more.  Glad I made the decision to purchase.,1
5,"Cute little purse for my cards, just right",1
5,I was delighted with these earrings and I am tempted to buy more.  I truly can't wait to wear them! I'm saving them for special occasions only. Great gift for the women in your life who like to stay mysterious and hold a lot of secretssssss! ;) lol,1
4,"These were well made but were either slightly smaller than similar sized socks from other makers, or the compression was less than the advertised strength. They're comfortable and fit fine, but the desired support was lacking.",1
3,"They do not stretch quite as well as I hoped, but will be fine. The yellow bracelets did rub off colour onto the skin. A much harder/rigid plastic feeling than the bracelets I remember from the time. But fine.",0
5,"Perfect purchase, I'm completely satisfied.  I had ordered a necklace that only the pendant came and was very unhappy because it was a gift and no chain I had would fit the pendant.  Good price, great quality, elegant look, and great for pendants it's hard to find an actual necklace for!  Saved the day.  A+++",1
5,They’re ok,1
5,"Wow! What a nice product and buying experience!  I received the item four days prior than the expected delivery date.  It was packaged nicely, tucked inside a gold box, which was placed inside a padded envelope.  I opened the box and found the pretty ear-cuff AND a pair of tiny earrings.  What a nice surprise!  I will likely buy from this vendor again, and I would recommend this vendor to others!",1
5,They keep my hand so warm,1
5,Fit was great and will have it for a few more years to come.,1
3,The zipper broke the first time I used it on my vacation in Florida!<br />I was extremely upset. The print is super cute and the material thick and soft though....Buy at your own risk.,0
5,these are perfect you can wear them to dress and they are so comfortable,1
5,Love the vivid color of these socks and they fit perfect.  I am very pleased with them and would recommend to my family and friends.,1
3,When I looked at the picture to buy it it looked like the colors where perfect and there was nothing wrong with them. Until I got them in and some of spots on the charms where supposed to be white but red was there and when the bottem part of the mushrooms where supposed to be white there where alot of spots of red there. So the colors where colored very porely. I wish I looked at the reveiws before I orderd.,0
5,"An absolutely adorable dress! My daughter (who is almost 7) gets compliments all the time. They are stretchy so they should last for a long time, despite her growing body. I ordered a size 8/9 to give her time to wear it and it fits very true to size as it is a bit long on her due to her normally being a 7/8. They are comfortable to play in, and seem somewhat durable. I am so pleased with these dresses that we've bought three different versions of it-and all are super cute!",1
1,It kept falling apart.  Surprised I never lost it.,0
3,"This top is very cute, with a vibrant color and stylish. Unfortunately, as with all Fihapyli clothing, it runs big. I have tried several tops from this manufacturer, and not one of them fit me. I continue to try because their clothing is very cute, and affordable. However, I just need to resist the temptation and stop buying them. For reference, I am 5ft 2 inches, 107lbs. I always order the smallest size available, and always end up returning due to being too large on me. However, if you have the body type which their clothing fits, you probably won't be disappointed.",0
3,Nice casual dress.,0
5,Love it!  Fits exactly as a small-and not snug like others-and A-Line for sure. Love it,1
2,These look nothing like the picture that was on it or the picture that was on the packaging,0
3,"These are my second shorts, they are super comfortable and great price but the second ones does not match my order .. don’t understand how that can happen..",0
2,"Very pretty colors and bows however, there was glue hanging from all of them. One of the bows busted right when I put it on my 8 month old. They were all different sizes and are a little tight on my baby girl. I usually love Ema JNe bows but these were poorly made and I don't think I'll be ordering again. Looks like they were made in a rush but I didn't pay much so I'm not too upset.",0
4,I wear it while working out when I don't do my hair.,1
5,I wish they had more options in more colors!,1
5,I was skeptical about the size when ordering this dress. So imagine my relief when I put it on and it fit perfectly. Am in.between 15/16 uk size.<br />Plus I love the feel of the material and the fact that it doesn't have a linking.,1
1,"The hats are extremely cute. Love all the colors. Would have really enjoyed the color I bought as opposed to what I received. I did not get what I ordered. Hat should have been tye dye bluish but I received yellow, big difference",0
5,"This PJ set is perfect with size, soft, and comfy.",1
1,Returned the belts. Buckle is cheap plastic and I couldn’t open it. Probably would have broken,0
4,"Very happy, just what i ordered!",1
5,My daughter loves this watch.  It is adorable.,1
4,Love the bracelet. True to size and very dainty.,1
1,"Scratchy material, for what ever reason, hemmed in smaller around the thigh area and it was uncomfortable to wear in wear in the heat in Miami. The scratchy material made it unbearable, I threw this out after buying a coverup at Walgreens.",0
1,It’s terrible,0
2,The extra large was so small it might have fit me when I was 11 years old.  I loved its appearance.  Would have been delighted if weren’t so small.,0
1,My glasses lasted 2 months before one stem snapped off and the polarized part started to debond. Will you consider a replacement?,0
3,Material is not stretchy. It is too small.,0
5,I love them! 8 months pregnant and work in the operating room...before I purchased my socks I didn't think I could work anymore until I put these socks on! Great buy!,1
1,"I received this bra and it runs very small and doesn't have the support or comfort as I had hoped. When I tried to return it, to the address that the company sent (out of the country), they said it was an incomplete address. Won't be purchasing again from this company!!",0
3,80% Cotton<br />20% Polyester<br /><br />Does not add up to 100% cotton. This is the second brand in the last two weeks I purchased that claims to be 100% cotton that is not.,0
1,They are smaller than expected for the size.  The material is not very stretchy nor that soft.,0
4,"Nice sock, fits well but NOT made in the USA as stated on website. This is the reason I selected this brand. County of origin USA should be removed from the website, untrue statement. Photo of the box taken, shows made in China.",1
1,"Extremely cheap, thin material.  It doesn’t look like it would hold up to one wash so I returned it.",0
5,Pretty good buy for simple cute pair of blue shorts that are comfty,1
2,"I ordered this in a size 6 for my almost 4 year old. It is waaaaay too big. Also, I ordered the robe in red, but the robe we received is hot pink. I’m still giving it two stars bc it is soft and cute and has pockets.",0
1,"These shoes have a horrible gasoline smell, so bad I left them outside and they gave me a headache! Could do they expect children to wear them??",0
1,Poor quality. Strap loops broke within 1 month.,0
3,Fits way too small,0
4,"Wear with sandles in warm months or with boots, and tights in cool months.",1
4,returned the item,1
3,"These are really nice, i bought them for my third baby. I have learned that the less you have the less you loose. They fit my 8lb 8oz baby big, but they still stayed on better than the other kinds. And they are supper cute",0
1,The shoe was damaged the first day of school. It is not meant for kids who run and play all the time. The design looks good but the quality of the material is not suitable for kids who barely know how to take care of shoes.<br />The price was attractive and the design did look decent. It was the reason I bought them.,0
4,"Very cute, my daughter loves it.. The only complaint I really have is that the zipper doesn't go all the way across the purse, there are gaps on both sides. But it's cute for what it is.",1
5,He loved it! We usually get his stuff from big and tall sections XL for him perfectly!!! Great material!!,1
5,Bought this for my husband it is unique and stunning. I wish the face was a bit bigger because my husband is large but that is just me personal opinion. The watch itself looks great and time will tell if it is durable.,1
2,"I was very disappointed with these pants. The pants were loose and not tight after wearing them for a long time. After wearing them for the second time, the seams behind the hips began to crack, so I could only give 2 stars.",0
5,"I have a SportKilt brand kilt and now this Tactical Kilt. I like them both for different reasons but I think this is definitely the cooler one of the two. Lays well, adjustable straps are nice and will be perfect for my intended purpose of Sports Competitions.",1
5,Love the many slots for cards,1
1,Returned,0
5,"Love this shirt, so soft and comfy",1
1,Too big,0
4,"I have a large chest so I usually like to size up so things fit flattering... I ordered an XL which is my normal size, almost all of my maxi dresses are XL. Well this one was a little big, you can see my bra thru the side of arm holes when I put it on & the empire waist falls at my natural waist, but still looks flattering so I just make sure I don't lift my arms up when wearing 😂",1
5,It is even more gorgeous in person I love it and wear it proudly.,1
5,Cute flowing skirt.,1
1,"Its really short but I love it just to have a guess haha I would wear it if it had a decent length and width it could pass as a large rag. It can't look good because it doesn't have the look like on the photo, its not wide enough to look bunched up and pretty",0
1,"Low quality. Buckle breaks thru thin top layer of leather, exposing a gray filler. Looks bad after you wear it once.",0
5,Great fit and quality,1
5,"My daughter loved these, purchased for x-mas.",1
1,Broken strawberry post and missing beads.,0
1,it's not even real wood!!!,0
2,"This is a very cute dress. I was really excited to be getting it,then couldn't fit it at all. I got an extra large and it's too small for my daughter who wears a small. There is no give in the material at all. The top of the material is different than the bottom. The top is polyester -cotton blend. I have no idea the type of fabric the bottom is; however it's will look nice on someone.",0
5,"I LOVE this necklace. The jewels look a little off set, but my Dad suggested to clear coat it with clear nail polish and now I'm not worried about it. I am about 5 foot 2 and the chain was a little long for me. I put it on a different chain to prevent it from flipping over and showing the back side as it dangled. Over all, I really like the necklace and it goes really well with my skirt, so a win-win for me! I hope you enjoy it!!",1
1,This shirt is poorly made and way too small. Do not buy it.,0
1,This dress runs about a one size small,0
2,These broke after 2 months,0
3,"Very cute, but half of it broke off after only one month. It's still usable but disappointing.",0
2,Returning - Runs long and narrow.,0
3,These sunglasses are rather small and look quite cheap.  The color is also very dull.,0
5,"These fit my 6’2 & 215lb fiancé perfectly! The material is soft and perfect for lounging around the house! He normally wears a large & that’s what we ordered. They were a perfect fit! After 3 washes & trips through the dryer, we haven’t experienced any shrinking or color fading.<br /><br />Highly recommend!",1
1,Broke in half after just a couple of weeks.,0
1,Way too baggy,0
3,Just bought these for a two week vacation. They looked good and fit well and were comfortable and lasted for the whole vacation.,0
2,"If you are planning to actually use these, forget it. If you want just a pocket decoration, get it. I was hoping to find a user friendly handkie, but this is NOT the one for this kind of use.",0
5,Great,1
5,I like it .,1
3,"Two stars taken away because it fit perfect up top, and like a bit shirt at the bottom. You have to have like no hips regardless of how petite you are. Or small your butt. Cute for a cover-up though",0
1,While the dress is in my size I enjoy a much looser fitting dress. Definitely if you are like me but a size up!,0
1,Size did not align,0
4,"I love this bracelet.  It's not quite as pastel in color, it's a little more earth tones, but it is really nicely made and it feels good when I'm wearing it.",1
3,"This is super cute, but it hung down more than I liked it to. I have a big ankle and it fit but I had to use the extension. I think if you had a smaller ankle it would fit nicely because you could make it tighter and it wouldn't hang as low.",0
1,"They were definitely light weight but VERY cheaply made.  3 pair have already fallen off the metal pierce earring.  I would not suggest buying these.  I would return them, except I shared several pairs with friends.  They thought the same as far as poor quality!!!",0
2,"One of the seams came apart on the first wash. Cute, but pretty low quality.",0
3,Comfy,0
1,"These socks run large and they're not very warm, at least not in the cold snaps around DC.",0
5,My girlfriend really enjoyed it.,1
2,I’ve been losing a little weight.  I thought this was a great way to keep working and not hiking my pants up constantly until I could buy a smaller size.<br />Hopefully the second and third belt will last a bit longer but I did not purchase them thinking they were disposable.,0
5,"[[VIDEOID:d178dbe31e931bdc30736c8bd5fb2148]] This is a fantastic design! It functions better than any backpack I've used or seen out there. The molle system is incredible and can be customized for any use. Ever detail in this backpack has been well thought out. Often I get frustrated trying to open and close the zippers while getting out gear. These are very smooth and easy to operate even if wearing gloves. Very easy to get things in and out of, and the abundance of pockets make it easy to keep your gear in certain spots. This is a smarter backpack and you can tell the company put a great deal of thought into the design.  It looks great, made from sturdy material, great functions and fits perfectly on my back.  The front pocket is very deep and you can hold a boat load in there. Also the main compartment is very large. The added side bag that attaches via the molle webbing is excellent! I can pack my &#34;essentials&#34; that I need to get to quickly. Very well thought out design right there.  The semi-rigid backplate combined with the shoulder yoke system does an excellent job of distributing the weight across your whole back, even with up to 30 or 40 pounds in there it feels way lighter.  I like that it has the Molle webbing as well so you can add pouches and things if you need more space. Anyone looking for a range bag, overnight carry bag, or even a BUG out bag will like this pack. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. Let's keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate and give my unbiased feedback to you. This is my honest opinion of the product. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.",1
1,Poor quality,0
5,Bien,1
5,"I love this dress! it is a little small fitting wise. I now have to loose some weight to comfortably fit in it but i do love! SO be sure to measure (i didn't, and i should have) and order maybe the next size up; otherwise its absolutely gorgeous and the quality is amazing!",1
2,This was too small and I am in process of returning it.,0
1,"Ordered a small (5’7 and 112 lbs) and it’s huge!! Like it was longer than my shorts (and they were medium length shorts). Also it’s not a racer back, just a plain tank.",0
5,Ordered for my wife for a cruise a little out of her comfort zone with the top being shear so she got a black bra to go with it and she totally Rocked it !! she normally wears a size XL 16-18,1
1,I received it one day and it was broken before I wore it to the event. They have a green piece of fabric that’s hot glued that came apart as I tried it on. I wasn’t happy about that Al all.,0
1,Doesn't look like photo. Ran very small. Fabric is rough and cheap.,0
1,Not a well made garment.  Is smaller than the size that is listed.,0
5,just lovely came quickly,1
1,"Nothing like how I expected, too large and unable to tie it tighter, I regret not returning it in time.",0
1,It was way to big,0
1,"Ugly, cheap looking.  Would not wear this at all.  And if I send it back, shipping and handling are going to cost more than what this thing is worth.",0
5,I perfer post stud earrings and these are a nice size for me. I ordered the ring first and really liked it so I checked back for other matching pieces. And the shipping did not take too long coming from Hawaii.,1
3,The chain is rather flimsy but other than that I like it.,0
5,Nice watch for a good price. Came with replacement battery.,1
4,"Feminine, low profile; nice detail.",1
5,"Love it! very cute and light weight, doesn't get caught on clothing, and it's hasn't faded. I wear it all the time even during showers and baths!",1
1,Gift for grandchild<br />Coat was poor quality and the belt was awful,0
5,Exactly as described. Came quicker than originally stated. Son LOVES them,1
3,shoe bags are smaller than what I thought.  May only be able to put one shoe in each bag - disappointment.,0
1,The fabric it's a horror and the made too,0
3,"Opened the packaging and could clearly smell the plastic on the shoe. There was a scuff on one of the shoes right out of the box. The soul of the shoe was not very grippy, mostly plastic and stiff. The size seemed a little larger than I expected. The colors are fine, my son will like having a second pair of shoes to choose from. Purchased these because there was a 40% off coupon. Probably won't buy again, but they are a little better than what I would find at Walmart for a second ""play outside shoe so your good shoes don't get destroyed in a week"" pair of shoes.",0
1,Glasses gave me a headache.,0
2,"Design and built: Stylish and looks nice. Does not look cheap. Good things ends here.<br />Performance: Bad. Just bad. Too much reflection from inner surface of the lenses, especially when you are facing sun. It is so bad that it almost looks like foggy. Not clear at all. Also not for active movement of course because it will not stay on your glasses. It is a clip-on after all.<br /><br />Summary: you get what you pay for.",0
1,Cheap and gets dirty very quickly.,0
1,"So cute designs , length was great just the waist part was way to small for my 19 months old and i got a 3t. It didn't fit her. She is only 24 lbs.",0
1,"I did like this blouse upon receipt. A little large but not too large. As usual I washed it prior to wearing...i just noticed that there are small holes in the front now, just above each pocket. Never got to wear it. Not sure if I can return this or not since I washed it. I will have to look into that. Disappointed for sure.",0
1,Literally craft wire... they were lopsided... I could have made them... wouldn't recommend.,0
1,"Not sure if this thing wants to be a dress or a shirt. It is really long...like down to mid thigh. So it could be a dress. But the armholes are larger than my thigh. Who has arms this big? Oddly the neck line is okay. It's just a really really bad pattern with waist too low, hem too low, arm holes too low.",0
1,Cheaply made!,0
1,"Absolutely loved this dress but it was so short I couldn’t wear it, Buy at least 2 sizes bigger than what you wear and it will fit! (Coming from a 5’0” girl)",0
5,"These leggings are sleek and comfortable to wear, with an elastic waistline to keep them from slipping as you walk or move. The fabric is somewhat sheer - you can slightly see my tattoos underneath the leggings - and personally I like that, although it may not be to everyone's taste. They have been keeping me warm in the chilly Chicago weather! They look great with shorts or a skirt, and they don't bunch up or sag the way some leggings do. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion - and I am very pleased!",1
4,"I truly like the style of this bag and the protective feet on the bottom.  I am unsure as to the quality.  The strap, which of course gets the most abuse, is not real leather.",1
5,I just received this necklace to give to my sister.  It is so beautiful!  She means so much to me and this says it all!  Thank you!,1
3,Bows came loose..,0
3,"Bought it to potentially replace my leather bill fold that has stretched so much my cards fall out unless I stuff it full, an endless cycle defeating the whole purpose of a minimalist wallet.  I bought this on the off chance it would more securely hold my cards without bulking up my pocket.  Sadly this turns out to be no thinner than my bill fold when my cards are added and it lacks any division or compartments to segregate cash from credit cards from ID and insurance cards.  I also am skeptical of the physical security of the wallet as the band only holds in one direction, it seems like its only a matter of time before a car from the middle slips out and gets lost, maybe it wouldn't but it does seem like more of a risk than I am willing to take with my credit cards.  Worth a shot, but it isn't the answer I was looking for, instead I will use it to hold additional cards that I don't carry around on a daily basis.",0
5,Lovely necklace for a niece who lost her dog recently to cancer.,1
5,"This summer dress is very cute. The material is very soft and pretty comfortable to wear. It’s loosely designed, recommend to buy the size smaller than usual. I can’t wait to wear it during the summer. Plus the material is not see through at all which is great. I bought the black color, but I think the flower one might be better. I am thinking to buy another flower one.",1
3,"Great quality and fit, but not nearly as &#34;blue&#34; as the photos suggest.  Not as mirrored/tinted as I thought they would be, so I can see my eyes through the lenses when looking at a mirror.",0
5,"I chose this coat because it has a collar not a hood, and the shiny material - make it just a little dressier than your standard puffer coat.  I am 5'3"" and usually wear XL (14/16, 38C).  I bought the 4XL and it is perfect for me - enough room in the hips without being bulky, and not too long.  Although, if you have a larger chest, it might be too tight.  If you have long arms the sleeves may be too short.  I have short arms, so I'm happy the sleeves are not dangling and don't require folding back like many of my jackets.  The fabric is super lightweight, which I love!  It is warm enough for my needs without being bulky.  But, I haven't tested it in the bitter cold yet.",1
3,"I wear gloves when I drive, to prevent brown marks on my hands.<br /><br /> I love the longer length, but I don't like the matte fabric, because it gets dirty really easily. I'd rather have something in polyester, so it doesn't have to be washed quite so often.",0
3,"The original mask l received as a gift looked similar to this one and fit like a glove. Unable to find the vendor of the original masked I purchased this one, only to find the it's slightly smaller. I ended up giving it away to someone with smaller features and they love it.",0
5,"Love these pants. Super cute fit, nice quality fabric, good color. Dressy slack with heels.",1
5,"I bought these glasses for myself and my daughter,I have and so has Stacy received so many accolades on the beauty<br />and craftsmanship of the glasses Great job BB Western. I never received the glass case tho",1
1,Very pale pink instead,0
1,vinyl not very good......after one wearing the vinyl by the big toe came off showing the white material on the bottom,0
5,Very nice outlook as it describe. Like it.,1
3,Meh.,0
3,Nice product .,0
1,I would not describe this as Sherpa. The material was more like a towel and very thin. When you go to return the item it is not free. Postage is required it is international and I was told it would be over $100. NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE.,0
2,This material is soft and comfortable however it is the type of material that very quickly developes lint balls that stick to the material and you have to pull or shave them off. Also everything sticks to them and you have to tape them. I had two pairs come in my order and after wearing one pair there is a hole in the crotch now. Personally I would not buy them again.,0
1,"It looks ok I guess, but it loses time.  Maybe I got a dud?",0
3,Runs really small through the bust.,0
5,Liked the fit,1
5,"Love it,  wonderful quality.",1
3,"The top silver part sticks way out and reveals a hole in the blue crystal behind it. I thought it looked kind of goofy when I first looked it. My girlfriend said she likes it, though.",0
4,It’s nice and soft.  I like how it fits.,1
1,"Poor quality. Fate of socks worn one time. Ive ordered before, but this batch was the worst.",0
3,These converters look nice but twist and do not hold heavier earrings.,0
2,"Too loose around forearm. Not form fitting, nor comfortable in the underarm area it rubs.",0
5,"Super trendy and really great quality. I 100% recommend these! I had ordered a color that wasn't what I expected and I contacted customer service and they sent me a new pair with no hassle, I even got to keep the other pair. Amazing customer service.",1
1,First pair had warped optics. Replacement pair broke in a month. Junk.,0
1,"The heart is actually a dull beige, not the clean bright white as pictured. Overall, they look and feel very cheap. Pass.",0
1,Too long!,0
1,"My son enjoyed this watch, but not for very long since it stopped charging or turning on after only a few hours of use.  It was a gift that I bought early so the return window was closed, hoping customer service is decent and I can get a refund.",0
5,I was so excited to get this shirt I love Megan and I did go up a size and tied it to the back to make my outfit look cute,1
5,They matched nicely with the necklace and she loved the look.,1
1,"Very unsatisfied, does not clip into place and causes the actual watch to fall off, I will be returning.",0
3,Cute shorts but pilled after the first wash.,0
3,"This was cute, but really really really short.",0
4,small form factor,1
3,They work as expected but you gotta wear a belt or it’ll look funny. Not as good as new pants. Lol,0
5,"So cute. The shiny stone is in the middle of the cat's body. The piece isn't large, but is very pretty and highlights your outfits.",1
1,"Looked at 10 gloves, all poorly stitched and falling apart right out of the package.",0
5,Great addition to my collection.,1
5,"Nice snug fit, easy to operate light and only kind of makes you look like a minion.",1
3,"I bought this as a gift, it’s fairly good quality but the yellow “twitch” wording on the front is cheaply put on. I just got it in the mail & it’s peeling before it’s even been worn.<br />Would be better if it was stitched in like other hoodies they offer but these were the colors I was looking for.<br />I’m sure after a wash or two the logo will rub off so be wary when purchasing.",0
5,"So cute! I’m 5’4, 215lbs and this dress looks great on me! Also I often times have trouble with the length of dresses, but this one is perfect. I ordered a size XL",1
3,Too thin,0
4,"The clasp works perfectly if you use your fingernail to open it. The heart sparkles beautifully, along with the entire bracelet. I had to return mine because I chose a size way too big.",1
5,"It is a very good Prayer Shawl. For the price,  no it isn't the exact fabric that the Prayer Shawls were made of in Biblical times BUT it DOES have the knots, the prayer/verses on each corner, has the long strans with the five knots on the corners and so much more. I would have liked a &#34;How to wash/care for&#34; instructions though. I am very happy with my Prayer Shawl. Thank you for making it accessible to buy.",1
4,They fit a bit smaller than I was expecting them to and don't seem like they would hold up really long term. But they did seem to lower electrical fields from experimenting with a EF scanner.,1
3,Ok,0
5,Got this as a gift for my grandma! She absolutely loves it!,1
4,Love these! I ordered a Medium/Large (I'm 5'5&#34; and 145lbs) the tag says medium and they are a little tighter than I would like but the material is stretchy so they still look good!,1
4,"The earrings are very cute, but they all arrived with the posts on the back bent. I was easily able to bend the posts back straight, but I'm afraid they might break off at some point since the metal has been compromised and make weaker now.",1
5,"i love this cardigan, the pink color is even better in person. It's exactly like the picture advertised (the first one). It's pretty thin but the material is really good, not cheap looking at all.<br /><br />I'm 5'7 and I ordered a small",1
2,not happy with this shirt at all; the fabric looks cheap and the M is actually S size; the sleeves were long so that's good but that's the only good thing about it,0
5,"I purchased these earring for a formal event, and I’m happy to report they exceeded my expectations in every way. They were elegant to wear with formal wear, not too heavy, AND they didn’t cause my ears to react. I wore these for hours: No redness, no irritation, no itching. They were absolutely worth it.",1
3,"Super cute, but the castle stops midway round the thigh. It would be better of it went all the way around. Also, it fits well everywhere except my thighs. It looks so stretched and strained.",0
5,Very cute came fast I love this.,1
3,These were way to big for me so i had to return them... the material was very thick but also well made.,0
1,It is comfortable. That is about it. The thin blue line is too dark to even notice under most lighting conditions.,0
4,"A nicely made, simple, slim wallet. Professional stitching, smooth leather material. It's labeled for men but I think it could work for either a man or woman.<br />I love the little ""owl eyes"" symbol in the bottom corner. It's not huge and cheesy like most company logos. Very subtle and cute.<br />Perfect for when you're going to anyone event like a concert and don't want to bring your important documents with you. Will hold your ID plus a couple cards and some cash. Card sleeves hold the cards in nice and tight but they're also easy to remove.<br />No complaints so far. Will update as needed.",1
5,I love these flip flops. The are absolutely my favorite. I literally wear them everyday.,1
5,Thank you so much for the black sweat pants I know my great nephew will love them for Christmas!,1
5,I got these for my bridesmaids during my wedding. They are very pretty and my bridesmaids were  very really happy to get them. They still wear them all the time.,1
4,It fits pretty good. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 140lbs. It's a little bit frumpy and the long shirt kind of reminds me of the 80's long shirts. It's a really thin sweater material and I have a tank top under it. I bought the large. The medium would have been too tight.,1
5,I think for the price youre paying this are great.,1
5,"I have to be honest. I thought this shirt would have crystals on it because it looked like it sparkled in the picture. But when I received it, I re-read the description, and nowhere did it say that there were crystals, rhinestones, or bling! I love this shirt anyway because I've received many compliments on it. The Purple Butterfly has a couple of different meanings - one for someone who has lost a child in a multiple birth and the other for Lupus. But even if you just like butterflies, or the color purple, you will love it!",1
4,I bought this for my daughter that's a rn and works long days. She likes them a lot,1
3,The quality is cheap and the material is thin. I have a long torso and this was very tight on my shoulders and the back went up my bottom. Also my breasts kept popping out if the top because it was very low.,0
5,My grandson loves his heelies!,1
4,"love the color, style, fit, and delivery time!",1
1,Cute but zipper is kinda cheap. It broke after only 1 wear,0
5,Awesome Deal! Comfortable and Happy to Purchase Again!,1
4,"I thought I ordered a plain black hat,plus it is somewhat small.",1
2,"Received Umbrella today.  Pulled it out of the box and the lower mounting pole was missing and the slip on protective cover was missing.  Now I have to pull all the labels off the box, attach a return label to the box and take it to a UPS store for a return.  Additionally I obviously can't use it and have to wait again for the shipment of another umbrella that, hopefully, had all the pieces and in good condition.<br />On the positive side, it looks like the umbrella is exactly as advertised although we cannot use it..",0
5,This dress was amazing . Perfect fit and super comfy. I will probably own every color before long!!!,1
5,"Great quality, perfect fit.",1
2,The edges around the ring on both sides are too sharp to wear comfortably. Very disappointed.,0
5,"Received a different pattern than shown in the picture, but very cute nonetheless so I kept it.",1
3,"Fit well and arrived quickly. The only disappointing thing was that they say multicolored pack and all the colors were black with one dark navy included. I was hoping for some fun colors like what was pictured. Overall, though, we'd buy again as they are exactly what we hoped for in undies.",0
1,False advertising. The inside is not a heart. It is just spots. Lies.<br />I will say the ribcage design is beautiful and the item is much lighter than expected.<br />BUT it is NOT a heart design as advertised and described.<br /><br />But--- the shipping was fast.,0
3,My daughter liked them but the bacl of the heel was too short for her. She didn't like how it felt too low at the back of her heel.,0
3,"Nice to have, but cannot read the words because they are not in English.",0
5,Fue un regalo para mi nietecito y le encantó,1
1,No stretch and thick denim,0
1,Could not get my key fob on the keychain. Returned.,0
3,My D is 20 months and I bought the 3 to 4 years size. It is so small that I can barely close the snaps on the shoulder. So order much larger that you normally would,0
1,The coat is nice and warm but a month in it ripped up the side and there’s a massive tear from bottom to armpit exposing the inner layer. Made cheaply.,0
4,Material seemed more fitting than it is,1
1,It really is a piece of junk.,0
4,"These are so cute and great quality, especially for the price, only they run so small. My daughter only got to wear them twice. No next size up.",1
2,Did not like the shiny fabric. Way more pink than in photo-Sent it back. If you like shiny pink you will love this!,0
4,"This was a gift for my Husband for Valentine's. He lo watches.  He collects all kinds Omega, Invicta etc. and this caught my eye. Its not expensive I just thought it was unique. And he loves it. So Thank you very much.",1
4,"Cute but too long for what i was looking for. If paired with leggings it would be cute but again, not what I wanted it for. Soft material.",1
5,Nice hat.  On time for Grandson's school Veteran's Day event.,1
5,I bought this as a birthday present for my 8 yr old little girl. She loves it. It's bright and super soft. She wears it just as soon as it comes out of the laundry.,1
5,"Good fit, sexy silhouette, silky fabric, vibrant rich blue color.",1
3,Covered my whole face,0
3,"Would have been 4 stars buy manufacturer cheaped out on instructions for using included resize tool.  Tin says see this YouTube video.  Only one problem, the sound doesn't work on the video and closed caption isn't available.  Figured out enough to do the job, but would have been much easier with working video.  (And, yes, I tried different browsers and pc's.)",0
5,Good quality,1
5,Love it. It's perfect for disneyland. :),1
5,"my fault , i thought it were doubleside earrings",1
5,Very supportive and great compression. I use them for travel and when I’ll be standing/walking a lot. Definitely help with muscle fatigue.,1
3,The picture looks much better than the real thing! It is cheaply made!,0
3,"This dress is okay. the material is nice and on the thicker side. The belt is okay..but can do without.<br />But I'm not at all thrilled since this dresses bunches a lot on the waist and below, and when you walk the bunches are just too much.<br />One thing to consider is that this dress can optically add some pounds, due to the white block in the middle, as opposed to a hourglass design, and mind you, I'm 112 lbs, and usually don't care about clothes adding a couple of pounds, but on this dress, I feel I look like a fridge.",0
5,Awesome price.Many compliments! Love the Navy color.,1
3,"Looks great, fits great, however, the quality is not the best. After washing it one time the threads starting to pull out and unravel. Other than that, good!",0
1,"Not clear,very hard to<br />Figure out where to find  the place to<br />Type the name in.",0
5,protects vision from sides and close up laser work.,1
1,It didn’t come in the bag,0
5,Description in one word. “Awesome!”  Felt compression on my ankle swelling problems immediately.  More than likely gonna get 2-3 more pair.  Definitely worth the price.,1
3,It was nice but had a weird smell when I opened the package,0
3,[[VIDEOID:a974906fbe45dc43a5861d8a0a4ab5d3]] The material is itchy and the fabric is cheap and see through you need seamless underwear and over a size smaller if you got small boobs over it looks pretty but the material is uncomfortable,0
1,This runs  VERY small. A medium was more like an XS,0
4,Really nice fleshtone plugs. I wear them at work and some people just thing I have really huge ears hahaa.,1
5,"I have a friend who has ""mask anxiety"" and was looking for some sort of alternative face covering. I saw these and they looked so pretty I ordered them. They are great! I was a little worried they may be small, since the model looks petite to me, but they fit my full figured face! They arrived quickly, and are so lightweight it is more comfortable than a standard face mask. I think at least 2 people I know have also ordered them now.",1
1,For nothing to small,0
5,These are a great pair of funky glasses!,1
3,The sleeves are insanely short!,0
5,Good product for a good price. Prompt shipping,1
5,My new favorite hat!,1
1,Clip broke off after about 2 weeks (normal use),0
5,JUST BEAUTUFUL,1
1,These gloves are next to useless.  They rip easily as you put them on.  They were supposed to be large but did not fit.,0
5,Actually surprised and it actually fits normally I wear 2x or 3x but the largest size they had was a 1x so I took a risk and buying it and I'm glad I did because it fits has great stretch to it and I really have no complaints,1
5,Great matte color .good size not to large not to small. It was very pretty and had a good weight to it. I had to return it because it just didn't work for what I needed it for but I ordered another one of similar appearance. Amazon refunded quickly and no hassles. It's so easy and convenient ordering from Amazon and they really do carry a great variety of products and from many different dealers.,1
5,These are the pants that I was looking for I’m going to order two more pair just like them thank you,1
1,"I bought this bracelet for a friends wedding and it broke within 3 hours of wearing it. The end of one of the strings broke off, leaving it able to freely side right out/off. Bracelet was beautiful, but not worth it to only wear one time, and not even through the event.",0
2,Flimsy,0
3,"Maybe I had my hopes up too high for this bracelet but I thought it was just ""okay"". The quality did not seem to match the price in my opinion. $25 seemed a little high for what I received. The bracelet did arrive quickly but also came with a few scratches on the front piece. Not a huge deal but I didn't expect that for the price I paid. The bracelet overall looks nice but is just not as nice as the price and other reviews made me think it would be.",0
3,No shape. Collar would not lay flat.,0
3,The black band looks great at first but the black coating comes off very quickly. I'd say it started coming off after the first week or so.,0
3,"Very loose, the cups fold over and create a weird shape. Only worked with a tight shirt over top to keep the shape.",0
5,nice,1
1,Awful fit. I have ordered this in 2 different sizes and they fit the same.,0
1,Do NOT buy this product!  I was very disappointed.  It was not described correctly and is very poor quality. It was something I would except to buy at a Dollar Store.  Definitely not worth $19!,0
5,"Strong clasps, I am not worried about these unhooking from my necklace.  They are not the prettiest chains and do not match the chain of my necklaces but since the extender is worn in the back where it will not show this is not a problem for me. I liked the variety of sizes it is nice to make my necklace shorter or  longer depending on which shirt I am wearing.  I would consider these a must-have for any jewelry collection. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.",1
3,Cute!,0
5,"I read on another review here that the bow was screwed and it was very half-baked. But on mine, it was done perfectly. This wallet looks gorgeous. I recommend it for people who don't carry that much cards, coins, or paper money. I basically use my card to pay for everything, so this wallet is perfect for me. It looks very classy and sexy, but it's still very cheap! TRUST ME, it's definitely worth the buy.",1
3,"The craftmanship is good.  Just as pictured, however the ring was a bit large. I had ordered a size 7  for my ring finger. The ring kept moving around, which made it a bit annoying. I was expecting the ring to be a bit heavier then it was. However for the price, once again, you get what you've paid for!",0
2,It’s very hard to open and then when you try to unfold it it’s singed to unfold it and you fell like you don’t want to pull too hard because it’s a cheap material so you don’t want to break it... and it’s so hard to get photos that small of circle I wouldn’t bother with it,0
5,My man loves it,1
5,"This giant beach bag is great and has several pockets for keeping things nice and neat. It's got plenty of room to carry several towels, snacks, toys, and has plenty of room left over. It's a great purchase.",1
3,"Quality was good, shirt fit around but was WAY too long for a large.  Maybe I should have gotten a medium?",0
5,"Well I now wake up on time every single morning, without fail. This thing works great. The shock function is a pain in the ass, but that's what gets me to wake up in the morning.",1
3,The dress is soft but the S size is to big. I am 5'3/ 117 pounds but this S size is big for me.,0
1,Horrible. Not at all how pictured. The beaded one is way too small & the other one that came with it with the moon is extremely big and poorly made. Can’t wear it.,0
3,"Cute, but came bent. I was able to fix them myself.",0
2,Runs small/material is not chiffon. It is a textured material,0
5,Quality shirt for the warmer months or as layering.,1
5,It's a solid clasp and works perfectly. I would definitely purchase again.,1
1,Broke and lost on first wear. Damn.,0
3,Very dainty and the band is not wide. The metal is flawless and the writing inside is well done. Appears to be very good quality. I just think it looks a little too small for an adult but my girls both loved it.,0
5,"I've been looking for belts for a while and I've generally always bought leather.. but they crack n lose shape, ware fast, rip.. etc... You know the deal cos you been through it... These belts.... Wicked comfortable, been using em for longer than the last leather belt and no fraying so far, and 2 different ways to take it off... Easy to release, easy to buckle or thread.. faster release when you realllllly gotta use the rest room, easy to losen if you've eaten too much lol... Totally loving these belts.. and for the price you can't beat it... I'd buy 100 just to have em but... I don't think I'll be needing any for quite a longgg time... lovin it!",1
1,not free people.,0
5,this is so beautiful the design is elegant the blue  is blue excellent watch,1
5,"Great product. Exactly as advertised. I am 6’4” and 255lbs. I should have gotten a size smaller but, I was able to shrink this one. It was great for my height but had way more... middle than I actually have lol",1
3,There was a bow in the front but not on the back of the dress,0
3,They didn’t fit my expectations they fit too loose and are made of flimsy material. Not something I would personally wear out of the house Incase it would tear. Ok to wear around the house. But for the price it’s better than a pair of flip flops :),0
1,Cheaply made from China . Cheap cheap fabric .,0
3,the fit isn't great and they aren't very warm. seem to slid down in the back on me,0
5,I like the size of the watch for a small wrist.,1
5,"Work great, will save me time in switching glasses all the time outside.",1
1,I am very disappointed in this dress. First of all the color is nor at ALL what is displayed. It is larger than expected and the style that is in the picture is not what was delivered. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED because I bought it for a wedding in a few days and I can't use it because of how it look.,0
1,to cheap looking and its overprice.,0
1,The sizes are not accurate and they should be measured by some one at Amazon and stop this company from wasting peoples time. I am sure I am not the first one to complain.,0
5,"Nicely made.  A little darker than I expected, but nice product.  It fits a little larger than I had anticipated, but it fits more on the hip, which I prefer, rather then a tight waist.  Note:  product is being shipped from China, so the tracking is a little more complicated.",1
5,"I love this wallet. It held my passport and kept it secure yet easy to access.  It has plenty of room for the larger UK bills, and space for credit cards as well.",1
5,NICE,1
1,Horrible shedding and pilling— even after 4 launderings. A nightmare. My house and body are covered with fuzz each time I wear it.,0
5,"Cozy, soft and just what I wanted.",1
5,these are fine,1
5,Really good product at reasonable price,1
5,As advertised. Looks good.No problems.,1
5,BEAUTIFUL DRESS! i absolutely love it .... i'm 4'11 123 pounds... and got a small. Fits perfect but obviously it doesn't fit as short. The material doesn't feel cheap. i would highly recommend it. I'm extremely happy with it. I may upload a picture later.,1
5,"Nice package, good fabric.",1
5,So soft and comfy.,1
1,These are not men's socks. The sole measures under 7 inches. These are boy's socks. The picture of the sock on a man's foot is laughable. I wear size 11 shoe and my foot would not fit inside the sock opening.,0
1,Leggings run very small and they are very thin.,0
5,Love,1
2,"Padding is in the wrong place. Not enough in the crotch, too much on the back of the butt. These run small. I usually wear a large, would have to wear an XL in these.",0
5,Up close you can definitely feel they're very fake but from a distance they're gorgeous. They're very light weight and the shipping was faster than estimated.,1
3,"Nice bag, material is similar to grocery store reusable bags. Bought for friend, Go Bill’s!!!",0
3,we had the problem with the zipper fixed rather than return it as there were none available to replace it.,0
5,Buenísimos. Y tienen ese pequeño paño por la zona del pulgar ora la transpiración<br />Lo único que no me gusta es que el logotipo de la marca resalta mucho.,1
3,Great little dress.,0
5,"I live on Oahu, and the rainbow is common to be seen here. I got my mom this rainbow bracelet and the design is so cute and gorgeous! It is light and fashionable.",1
1,These are nice lenses but unfortunately they only lasted 3 months before the finish on the lense came off. Very disappointing.,0
5,Wore this as part of a halloween costume as Lady GlitterSparkles from Trolls. It was awesome! Fit really well and was super comfortable.,1
1,This is NOT a sweatshirt like the description indicates. It is a long sleeved t-shirt. Not very good quality at all.,0
5,I love the color and fits as expected.,1
1,don't waste your money. the second band was way too loose and looks terrible.,0
3,"For reference, I am 5'7, 135 lb with a pretty average body shape, 34C. This dress was cute but waaay too short! When I tried it on you could see about half of my butt. This would probably be way better on someone shorter but if you are around my height DON'T buy it your whole booty is gonna be out. I'd say probably if your shorter than 5'4- 5'5 then you can go for it and try it, but any taller than that... it's just not gonna work  out. Also the fabric feels like an athletic shirt type of material or even swimsuit fyi",0
1,Huge!,0
3,"The silicone band is a little thick but it’s nice and pliable and the two band collars are good.  However, the pins were too short and I had to get them out of the band and use my old pins.",0
5,They worked out great on me and they fit perfect,1
5,Nice item. A bit too clingy but nice product.,1
5,"I love this blouse it fits as excepted, highly recommended!!!😍😍😍",1
5,Nice quality! Can use for pre-K and k! Tassel had correct year. Happy with purchase,1
1,Defective merchandise,0
5,"These booties are sooo cute, I am a Fresno State alumni and when I saw these I had to have them. My baby is due in October so I have not had a chance to use them yet, but I am really excited about them!",1
5,It is good,1
5,[[VIDEOID:6315c5a8e0874eec71a0bd27aabff1c6]] I did what most do and bought a multi pack of nato straps for under $20. I figured what’s the difference between the cheap straps and something like this Speidel NATO strap?<br /><br />Everything<br /><br />The Speidel NATO straps are the best bang for your buck in terms of look comfort and feel. I like reaching the apex of performance for the dollar. These are it. These beat out many straps that are double the price. They come in a nice clear acrylic case with the Speidel logo embossed in the front. So rad.<br /><br />Speidel please make more colors.<br /><br />They fit and wear well on my 7in wrist. Watch worn is a Timex Fairfield 41mm that measures 43mm lug to lug for size comparison.,1
5,Has a good feel for price and perfectly as disribed .,1
5,Have all 3  Milan O twist adjustable chains I love them they look very attractive with high necks and low next I also have the matching bracelet and anklet there a beautiful match sturdy wear them in the water they do not rust I wear them to sleep and I just get dressed and go can wear it to dress up or just to wear as a day-to-day jewelry I've got all of them every size,1
5,Nice breathable shirt. I use it while riding my motorcycle on hot days.,1
2,Too long even to very tall people.,0
3,"The dress is cute..<br /><br />The polka dots seem a lot larger in person than in pictures. The quality of the dress is nothing to write home about, so it will make sure for an easy summer dress<br /><br />If your busty order up!",0
4,"This skirt is so very cute! I love the Sesame Street characters on it, and the elastic waist. I was hoping it would be a tad longer though. I like midi skirts to hit at my lower calves, not slightly below my knees. I would've purchased a large instead of a medium for more length, but it sold out. My height is 5'4, waist 31 inches. The only thing that could make this better is if it had pockets. I love it!",1
1,The underneth of this shoe is wayyyy to smooth. I almost slip and fall. It is made in all swade material.,0
5,"very well satisficed with the outfit and its fitting .<br />strechable , comfortable  and it has many pockets to keep stuff like cellphone , ipod, cards etc",1
1,"The button fell off when I tried them on, no biggie I think until I chase no 3 yr old down and squat down to a big rip in the crotchety area. Yes that's right the first time I had these on a huge test failed. I would say buy these and just don't squat and you might be fine. Own a sewing kit for the button",0
4,"I love the camo pattern! Seem to be made well. Right out of the package they didn’t want to stay up, but after a good hot wash and dry they seem to stay put better!",1
2,"Listing and product image indicates lining is grey but it is bright white and very obvious. I had planned on removing the lining anyway for a costume, but it would not be wearable for anyone as is. If all you want is gathered tulle skirt and are up for doing the work to make it look nice go for it otherwise save your money.",0
2,"This is a very cute vest, however it is about 4 sizes too small. Sizing is not American. Very disappointed.",0
5,Granddaughter loves them. Good compromise since I won't let her have the real thing!,1
3,This is cute but too thin and frail to use as a keychain,0
3,"The pull sides to tighten don't stay tight no matter what I do.  The side rectangular holders for the pull strap don't do anything and I have been frustrated.  We have used them 3-4 times a week for two months with swim lessons.  We have owned several different brands of swim goggles.  I bought these for the color and the lower price when we lost our last ones, but they were not worth it.  At least they don't fog up when changing room temperatures.",0
5,"This is such a cute shirt & well made.  I’ve already washed it several times and it did not shrink.  I wear a Medium, so that’s the size I ordered & it fits perfectly. I love it!",1
3,"This scarf is pretty but much bulkier than I expected or wanted.  However, the price was right and I do wear it.",0
2,Soamy rinckle after 1 wasn't and strips came down. And the material made me very uncomfortable down here during workout and sweated even more.,0
3,"The fit was perfect for my daughter , but she does have a narrow foot that many shoes do not fit well.<br />Quality of the shoe is not great for multiple wears. They are beautiful shoes, but they fall apart after only a few times being worn. The bows came off and the jewel strips started coming off after 3/4 wears.<br />I would still purchase again for special event wear.",0
5,The leather on these gloves almost looks fake because it is so smooth. They are very warm and comfortable.  The fingers are just slightly longer than I would like but all in all...a very good quality and beautiful looking glove.,1
2,"I love the quality and look, but the opening it too large for my small wrists. When I take the hair band off the bracelet falls off.",0
2,"I bought a black / white one which I love. When I purchased this one, it fits nothing like it and I even went up a size and it still too small.",0
5,Great for fidgety hands and fingers!,1
4,"As a whole, the set looks nice. The largest handbag is not very large, but if you don't carry a lot around, it will do. The smallest piece is flimsy and is more of an extra; I would not take the full star off for that, as the other bags are great. However, the long handle burst, while I was outside. I usually stuff my bags, but as it happened, I was using this bag for the first time, and I didn't put much in it. The bag was not heavy that day. The short handle is fully functional, so if you don't use the long one, it should do fine. As it happens, my mother came over and dispossessed the set(minus the torn handle). I haven't heard any complaints so far.",1
5,Very good. I will buy more from the seller.,1
5,My 2yo granddaughter loves these boots.,1
5,"So far so good. Does what it's supposed to do. My watch is keeping accurate time and it's good to know I can pick up and use without having to reset things (I know, kind of a first-world problem). In any case, it's inexpensive and does what it's supposed to do. My only con is that it doesn't really suggest or tell you about the settings. I realize all watched are different but there must be some standard? No idea.",1
5,only tried them on still early in the season little big but hoping they will shrink a little when start using them,1
2,These glasses are huge & nearly blackout glasses. If you have a large head and don't need to see where you are going this product is for you.,0
5,Soft fabric & fits perfect! Love it!!,1
5,"This is a very beautiful necklace with the right size, and it's nice to wear daily.",1
4,"Beautiful fun necklace. However the links may have spaces, which broke the link in my necklace. Had to use pliers to fix it. Other than that, it's pretty.",1
1,Very disappointing product and unfortunately I waited to long to return.  The magnet is very weak and the clip is only viable if you clip just a few bills.,0
4,Like the stones,1
5,Item arrived on time.  Good product,1
5,I would give this bag 10 stars if I could. It is simply the best made bag I have ever bought. it has three zippered pockets besides the main compartment all the zippers work perfectly it holds what it needs to hold without losing it shape and without being uncomfortable to Carry.,1
5,Perfect for my husband’s Bushnell watch. Glad it had screws and screwdriver as they are unique to the watch.,1
5,Great product. Warm and helps during the cold weather. Looks fashionable too.,1
3,The quality is good and the design is just like the picture shown but what I don't understand is why a kids nightgown would be dry clean only. I haven't washed it yet but will be updating this post if there is any negative effects of washing this in the delicate cycle.,0
5,Very nice and warm it’s cute and I get lots of compliments. I still wear a disposable mask underneath.,1
5,Love love love this watch!!!!,1
5,Great jewelry making,1
5,Best socks we have bought on amazon!,1
5,"I bought these for my daughters for Mothers Day. They are really cute and even better than I thought.  The back of charm is sparkly, which I did not expect.  I am very pleased with them.",1
1,"these are not at all warm, and do not stay up on a kid's face without being tucked under goggles, which basically fogs them up.  This is more like a sleeve of tech material.  I guess they'd be good in the desert if you were riding ATVs in the sand and you had an extra hand to hold them on.  They'd block sand or dust.  But not for cold snow sports!",0
5,Recibí lo que esperaba,1
3,White was a bad decision on my part.,0
1,Run very small I brought a large and a x large and it was like a medium,0
1,Broke my ears out! Took a week for the inflammation to go away. I'm thinking these aren't even 14k posts.,0
1,"I do like the color and the look, but Scoyco always send any size the have available not the one you order I have already returned three Scoyco jackets for the same reason. This jacket look nice, but also cheap made",0
5,"Exactly what I expected , true to size",1
5,"I love these jeans. They're exactly what I've been looking for. A lot of the other reviews said they weren't high waisted, but of you have a fairly short torso like I do, these will be perfect. They have a lot of stretch so I recommend sizing down.",1
5,Match my truck color,1
5,Just awesome boots. Fits as expected. My foot length  - 24.7 cm medium width.,1
3,"Cute, but the charm has fallen off the key ring multiple times! Had to replace the piece that holds the charm to the key ring.",0
4,"He is very happy with the fit, the quality and the color",1
3,"The necklace is made of ribbon going through the little gold pieces. I didn't notice it when I ordered it. It is still a fun necklace, but it is not super high quality materials. It is not very flexible either and feels a little heavy.",0
1,My package came today and only 3 of the actual buttons were included. 8 of out yellow buttons were in my package that I did not order!! So upset!,0
5,"BUY ONE! Best hat you'll ever own...  Super comfortable, extremely well made, flashy and smooth.  Waterproof and not to mention super fly!",1
1,"This product is not as described, it's actually terrible quality. Too big and loose. The material is cheap. It's faded and fuzzy on the first wash on a gentle cycle.... absolut garbage do not recommend. Don't waist your money or time on this",0
5,Good solid material. Fits as expected.,1
2,"As I previously said, cute but much too long",0
5,Christmas gift so I hope it fits.  It looks a little large for a sweatshirt.  Kind of pricey for a plain blue sweatshirt with what looks like an iron on but nice to find something other than &#34;grandma&#34;.  I also ordered a granny one for my mom.  I'm anxious to see how long they last.,1
1,I love the size and feel of this bag. Paid someone extra to monogram it when i received it. Packed it to take to the beach for our cruise. Got it out to use it and put 4 tubes of suncreen and some sunglasses in the bag. Went to zip it up and the zipper will not stay together. So i was stuck without a bag for the beach and out the money i paid extra for the monogram because i cant send it back now.,0
5,SATISFIED PRODUCT,1
5,"These are so adorable!<br />I had to purchase it for my 4yo to bring to her school and they are much more than what I expected!<br />They look so cute, they have good cushion, and fit perfectly (true to the size).<br />Super recommend it!",1
2,"This ring was pretty and I was excited when I got it because it was a simple, little, green glass ring. But I wore it for a day and it broke! I ordered a black one too from the same seller, and it broke too! After only one day! Even though it was only 90 cents, it shouldn't have broken so soon! What the heck. I was sad.",0
5,good stuff,1
3,This was for a Halloween costume. It was fine for the timeframe but already has to be sewed. Average rating.,0
1,Super small. My daughter might wear it as a bracelet.,0
4,"Very nice sleepers, they seem to be well made. I bought half size bigger and they fit perfectly.",1
5,"The glass seashell is beautifully done, and the necklace that came with it is soft and comfortable. The size and weight of the pendant is perfect.  This was so pretty, the other women in my house wanted one too.<br />This would make a wonderful gift for someone who loves the sea.",1
5,Cute dress for the Halloween season! Fits great and great value,1
5,"[[VIDEOID:cfb7641ae0d1d1ba23c3ea9d3e9979de]] i own these leggings in blue, grey, purple, and black. they are literally the best leggings i own! they hold me in, they don’t roll down, they are not see through, and overall they are the best pairs of leggings that i own.<br /><br /> i was nervous, because whenever i order leggings they *always* run small. i ordered the medium and they are perfect. i am 5’7” and 140 lbs. seriously i need these in every color. i have been telling everyone about them.",1
3,I only ordered these for the blue pair and I received too green pair.  Very disappointed.,0
5,"Dress is lovely, fully lined, wonderful fabric. The tie up back is both attractive and accommodating for varying busts. The orange color is bright and soft somehow?! Very pretty. Would definitely order from this brand again.",1
3,"Alot thinner than shown, rip easy",0
3,"The small band broke with in first few wears. Otherwise, nice watch.",0
5,Worth the money,1
2,"I am 5'7"".. usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.. 38 E/F  I ordered the xxl.  The top and body are loosely fit.  The bottom with the tie is oddly shaped.  You have to tie the tie very tightly because other wise there is a big loop that shows 'open' if you try to loosely tie.  The real issue is that the should cut outs are so poorly placed the holes are to the BACK of your arm!  I tried to reposition several different times and the openings will just not stay forward.  So weird looking, not ideal.  The color is a very pleasant true coral (pink/orange).  The material is very soft, but wrinkly.  Honestly, in my opinion this blouse is poorly made and the material is poor.  I would pass.  I would donate this, but in all honesty, its just too poorly made even for that. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",0
1,This sweater looks like it flows and and it’s long but when I got it I was extremely disappointed because it was stiff and boxy. No flow or length to it at all which makes me feel like the picture is very misleading.,0
5,Ghost wolf one,1
5,The grandkids really love it in the rain. It was worth the purchase to see them enjoying themselves.,1
5,Ordered these for a friend (size m). They were just amazing and the fit was just right.. already looking into ordering a few more,1
1,Very disappointed! No hardware or directions. Was purchased off a wedding registry last winter and just opened it. Can’t be used. Waste of money!!!,0
1,We returned these due to one earring arriving broken.  :(,0
2,Fit smaller than expected,0
4,"Didn’t realize this was short sleeve. I’m a medium, but I took the advice to get 2xl as the comparable size, but it’s a bit too large. Hopefully will shrink in a little hot water",1
5,Beatiful dress! I loved it,1
1,cheap half of them have already broke,0
5,"It works great for all my nylon webbing and 1 "" perfect for my gear and the bags I'm making.",1
5,"Package includes 2 pairs of Metal frame blue light blocker reading glasses. Fits my face perfectly and very lightweight, so comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I really appreciate the spring-hinges; makes them more durable.  They come in a variety of strengths.<br /><br />They came packaged nicely. Wrapped in a soft plastic covering and placed in a very nice durable box. Would even make a nice gift!<br /><br />I really appreciate they came in a set of two. I can keep a,pair in my office and one by my end table for reading. Nice set, works great for men or women.",1
5,"Seemed to be good quality, had a pretty silver shine to it",1
5,I like this face coverings and it’s cute. It’s thick and fits for all sizes.,1
5,Cute and super small. Exactly what I was looking for!,1
5,Good quality and fits as expected.,1
5,"Fits well, looks like Deku's mask on your face.",1
2,Much bigger on my face than expected,0
5,"I saw this on tik tok as I’m sure everyone else did As well, and they definitely were everything that I expected them to be. They are the softest leggings I have ever had even After I washed them. I’m 5’6 and 135-140 pounds and the medium fit Perfectly and even tucked in my little mom pooch. The length was also perfect and went over my ankles as I like. I want a pair in every color as soon as there back in stock in my size. Buy them you won’t regret it.",1
1,"Party city $10 (at most) latex garbage. No integrity, rigidity, etc. Big floppy rubber mask with hollow horns. Hair way off too. NOTHING like what's advertised. Returning mine for a refund immediately. Don't waste your time.",0
2,The gold part is not aligned with the earrings as pictured.,0
5,Great replacement for an older bracelet,1
1,The dress size was very odd. Too small in torso but giant in shoulders and sleeves. Not a well-made item.,0
3,These are cut well but the material gives out and it thins itself out even to a smallest chafing.  Should be thicker just a but more.,0
5,I use it with a black top and the necklace looks like it is part of the clothing with the black lace. It makes my dress looks unique. It does not look cheap but is quite nice. I really like it and the price is fantastic!,1
3,Hi I received the order right on time<br />I love the material and perfect ankle length as I needed<br />I wish I could have been ordered one size less<br />Rohini,0
3,The earring is too heavy and leans forward,0
2,"Very cheap and poor quality. I should have know, you get what you pay for.",0
3,i only wear the shorts. the shirt is a little small. but the shorts r very comfortable they do roll up a little bit when i walk but that’s any shorts. they are not sweat proof!,0
5,Love the dress.,1
4,I love the fact that it was so pretty and feminine. At the beginning of the day when I the first time I wore it it was a little tight but as the day wore on it stretched so by the end of the day it was perfect!,1
1,"Ill fitting, Shiny polyester and very transparent.",0
2,Too small for a 2X unfortunately 😒,0
5,"Love these, soooooo comfortable!",1
2,"I got the watch because I like the design and wanted something I can wear everyday and not worry about destroying it.  Design is great.  Love the look and feel  but hate the fact it stops every couple hours.  Even after winding it like the instructions say,  and manually shaking it, it stops.  Mind you I move constantly for work. !!  Wouldn't recommend.",0
1,Torso is very short compared to the rest and doesn't sit or even look like it is supposed to once on. If you tried to put the shoulder down you would tear a seam. Definitely not an item I want in my closet.,0
5,Great gift for fans.,1
1,This dress runs small.  I generally order a XL for a loose fit but this XL fits like an Large and the top is even smaller.  The person should not be andy larger than a B cup and generally wear a size 12 for this XL. Returned it.,0
3,"This is a great product, I have ordered twice. However this second shipment didn’t have the full 18 as it should.",0
2,Way too long and tight around the bust area,0
4,So far so good...,1
5,Glasses were a hit at 80s party,1
5,Light weight and small,1

1,not what I expected,0
5,Very good shirt,1
3,bought this for my daughter but it was to large,0
3,Zipper broke but nice pants,0
4,It is hard to get my iPhone 11 in the case and I have to push hard to n my ale the buttons work. I can’t see the top of the phone screen.,1
5,Fits good. Bought for a gift,1
2,Not very much padding,0
5,I love these. I wear them everyday.,1
5,Absolutely beautiful and well made/high quality. I even bought another one for my mom. I was looking for something earthy and this is perfect. Shipped quickly and came with a really nice bag. Very pleased!,1
1,This was not wide enough to to wrap around me and keep me secured that folds coming out,0
1,Junk. Clamped 3 times on my Olympic bar and the plastic pivot point snapped on both sides. Wouldn't trust these to hold any significant weight.,0
5,"I cannot believe how well this boot fits. I've been purchasing and returning boots for months in the search of something that fits my slightly wider than average calves. The elasticized shaft really fits the bill. The boot itself is comfortable, breathable and broke in on the first ride. Toe box is wide enough to accommodate thick socks, but they aren't needed. Basically I'm in love with this boot!<br /><br />I would also like to mention that the customer service at Miller Tack is impeccable. All of my questions were answered promptly and my order came a full week earlier than expected. Thanks so much guys! A+++",1
1,nice blouse but does not run true to size,0
3,"Beautiful dress. Very very long. I'm 5'6, 140 pounds. I ordered a large. The length hits the top of my feet. The waist is a lot tighter than I thought it would be, so if you have any belly fat at all you will look pregnant.",0
3,This fits smaller than expected and even with the bra extension didn't help and the bottom rolled (see picture) the bra it's self made me feel like I had back rolls and skin rolled over the bra fabric under my arms. The support was very stretchy when you pull down the pad for nursing. I really wanted this to fit because I have a hard time finding bras with no underwrites..,0
1,Muy mala calidad y los tamaños corren muy grande,0
1,"Difficult to use, doesn't stay in place. Tried it several times and just gave up.",0
2,After a few times of wearing the hinges become loose and the clasp doesn't hold well.,0
1,Cheap!!,0
5,Good quality.  Size right.  High recommendations from this happy customer,1
3,The color says Khaki bit it look od green. The zipper is on the wrong side for typical male gender clothing.,0
2,"I'm usually a large but I seen some of the reviews saying it came big so I ordered a small according to the size chart. It's still super big. For some it might not be a big deal. The quality isn't bad, a bit see through but since I'll be wearing it at the beach I don't mind. It's very stretchy material.  It's ok.<br />It doesn't hand right and it's cut extremely weird.",0
4,"It's much larger than I expected and has so many compartments that I can actually find my wallet, phone and keys when I need them lol... the design is not bad either. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a crossbody bag that you can easily wear while traveling or shopping!",1
3,Smaller than expected,0
5,Lots of complimentts!,1
1,This dress is soft and beautiful but…it’s a high waisted dress. (I’m 5’3” 128 lbs) The waist line is 2 inches higher than my waist and the length is 3 inches higher than my knees. So strange… it’s a medium but does not fit length wise in the two areas.,0
5,"I love the way they are made, and the way they shine. I will be getting more of them.",1
1,"I got a large and am 160 pounds and 5'8.5"" tall. This dress was entirely too short and too small. I couldnt even zip the dress up and the end stopped right beneath my butt. The bottom portion of the dress is some sheer material that is extremely thin and just sticks to my legs. I would not suggest ordering this item if you're tall.",0
5,"Does not look and feel flimsy at all! I was afraid it was going to be cuz of the price but I was pleasantly surprised! And yes, it doesn't smell rubbery like the ones I had (was even more expensive!) so I'm very happy with this purchase.",1
5,"My wife loved it! Surprising her with it , her eyes widened and mouth dropped open!",1
1,"Nuca recibí esta falda y hice mi reclamación pero ello dijeron que ya lo avían entregado pero no lo recibí, Y no me dieron un reembolso y perdí mi dinero.",0
4,"This watch was for my wife and she just loves it,for swimming and sports",1
3,The belt fits in an odd spot on me and the bust is snug. I wish the sizes of things were a bit more universal...,0
5,"Ordered the XL in green. I'm 5'4&#34;and 180#....fits beautifully. ...... the fabric feels so good to the touch, but it is a heavy dress..... don't wear it to your annual physical. ..lol",1
2,It's nice I just don't know how to apply it.,0
5,"Lightweight and comfortable, my favorite summer bra!",1
2,It was my error I order it to small,0
5,Love these glasses. Great for sunny or cloudy weather they eliminate glare. I use them at night if glare is bad and I use them in rainy weather.,1
2,"This is clearly my own personal opinion of the fabric choice used to make this garment.  I was expecting a standard T-shirt like a Hanes Beefy T, but was delivered a shirt made of something similar to satin.  Probably will never wear it simply because it's just not my style.",0
1,Hour hand is off,0
2,These glasses are cheap Made in China stuff. The brand reads &#34;VELENTINO&#34;. Also I have a round face and the frame is not as big as I expected.,0
4,I like the scarf. The color & material are nice. Initially the scarf is snug fitting. What I did was let the scarf hang from a hanger & then on the end of the scarf I hung a heavy item. This gave it some stretch. I think over time the scarf will loosen up. I was too impatient to wait for time to go.,1
5,"[[VIDEOID:f789ca9de281f605628aaac16b78ca0c]] Medium fits me perfectly, not too tight on my hands. Thick enough to protect your hands from super hot water and elastic enough to clean house your fist. I like how it goes about 3 quarters up my arm and when I pull it all the way up, it is completely flush against my skin so it does t let water or soil in. I used this fir soil and it’s much better than gardening gloves. It oddly smells like vanilla pudding too when it’s new. Overall, for a pair these are perfect. No flaws which is rare for me.",1
5,Just what I thought. Good material Really like it,1
5,Cozy and soft lining similar to lamb's wool. Feels good on your bare feet. Quality seems fine.,1
3,Na,0
5,Gorgeous,1
4,In length it’s short for a taller gal - I’m 5’7 it comes to waistline.  Wear a tank under.  I did have a screen print put on it.....,1
3,Not worth the price.  Granddaughter likes it though.,0
5,My son wears this all the time!!!,1
5,"I bought this beautiful hand bag because my name is Shirley. That was too good to pass up.<br />It is expensive looking and beautifully made.<br />The initials and gold tassel and chain are quality items.<br />It has enough space for what we need for being out for a dinner or special occasion.<br />I am looking forward to using it when the right occasion comes along.<br />Even being bed ridden with cancer, I can now get out in my wheel chair for a rare lunch or<br />dinner, because of my restricted diet.<br />When the occasion arises,  I’m prepared, thanks to Amazon☺️<br />Even if the initials are not your own, enjoy it.<br />Such a classy treasure👏👏👏",1
1,Not as cute as I anticipated. Appears to be very cheap quality.,0
3,"Very cute necklace, but broke after wearing it only 3 hours.",0
5,"Use for work(on feet all day), and for traveling. Very comfortable, for wearing  8-10 hours at a time. Works great!",1
1,This necklace is not made well and is not flexible when expect it to be. Pass on this necklace. You'll thank me.,0
5,These boots are great for the amount of money I paid for them. I bought them for my hubby for when he is out doing snow removal in our driveway. He is very happy with them and said they fit just right.,1
5,Very good fit. Comfortable and breathable.,1
3,"Fits as expected. After a few washes the straps get uncomfortable, but they work and the colors are cute.",0
5,A top notch product from a company who stands behind their product. The shoe trees perform exactly as intended and the company really provides excellent support. Thank you for such a great product and service. I would highly recommend these be purchased for anyone looking to take care of their shoes. I am officially in love with this company.,1
5,Silver Forrest Earrings are my favorites! I have at least twenty pairs❣️These are actually a gift for someone that I know will love them like I do🤗,1
5,love this piece also im  into the glittery crosses right now I think they look very nice I got a few of them and im very happy,1
4,The outside is good and sturdy but when I received it the inside material was coming off. I just used super glue and so far no problems. I love the skull print.,1
3,It's a little too small for comfort,0
1,My pair arrived with runs in the polarization on the right lens. Really messes with vision. Cannot wear like this. Not satisfied at all.,0
1,It was lightweight material and left and right side patterns were mismatched!!!  Just a piece of junk.  I returned it immediately.,0
5,"I own a small business making jewelry.  I decided to give these a go.  They're inexpensive and very light weight.  They're not very long. But will hit an adult around the upper chest area.  I like that they're soft, and haven't had any issues when wearing this with a pendant.  I let my daughter make her own pendants as well, and use these chains.  These are a perfect length for a child.  (I like the longer necklace so this is solely based on my opinion).  But it is a good length for an adult too.",1
5,"Very manly and fashionable bracelet!<br /><br />Amazing price, it's just a perfect complement for mens fashion outfits.",1
1,"No me gusto la tela de las mangas no me gusta y aprieta en lo brazos, la terminación del vestido es poco delicada de mala calidad",0
2,It was cute but too small. Kind of cheaply made.,0
5,Great product.  Extremely comfortable.,1
5,Fits true to size.  I've gotten so many compliments when I wore it out!,1
1,"When I opened the package I was excited, it’s really cute. I tried it on and I was happy until I turned around, the backside of the swimsuit bottoms are pretty sheer and you could see everything 😬, I returned them.",0
1,"Definitely not piercing grade metal. It tarnished within a couple of days. Don't waste your money. The simulated opals are just plastic with glitter ""shreds"" in it. I was very dissatisfied.",0
4,"I didn't like it when I first put it on, but it's perfect to wear with leggings and it's warm as well.",1
5,My husband loves his tie--and so do I!!,1
2,Pro: Great colors and soft. Tagless is a plus for my toddler.<br />Con: One of the shirts we received had a micro-hole in it. Not sure how well the shirts will hold up after wearing & washing. I am sending back for a replacement.,0
1,"It was very soft. The fit for me was not so good,needed more fabric above the skirt to achieve blouson affect.",0
4,"Work well. Only drawback is the placement of the snaps...not really at either. It still works well, harder to fasten.",1
1,Was way to fragile and soft. Mine wouldn’t close and kept bending. Waste of money!,0
1,"Looking at the picture this looks to be lime green or close and white, it is closer to an olive green and grey.  Had I known it was this much darker I would not have bought. It is a deceptive picture.",0
5,Great item for the price,1
1,"The color of the lens is more green/blue than gold. All the frames need a little bit of work with the nose pads to get them to sit right. These are small lenses, so if you have large face, stay clear.",0
5,"What  I got was marked 'new', but the packaging had clearly been opened before and there was tape holding the label and box together. The squishy was also yellowed, and not clear like advertised, but it doesn't make sense to pay to send it back..<br /><br />Updated 12/9/19: Hamee customer service was amazing in responding to me. They apologized for the used condition I received my first one in, and replaced it. The replacement I received was definitely new, and I really appreciate Hamee's support and diligence. I love this little squishy a ton!",1
1,"Vest is one size fits all by adjusting snaps and is very light weight, both pluses in my opinion. However I purchased for the heat affect which I am sorry to say is extremely disappointing. I am using it for the first time tonight and have it set on the red setting (highest temperature) and can barely feel any heat anywhere on the vest. And I do mean barely feel it, unfortunately for this reason I can not recommend this vest at all. Very disappointed with it.",0
5,Love that it breaks down for travel. The weighted component is awesome.,1
2,"there is an area next to the front foot, that almost looks like there was supposed to be another paw and it broke off. kind of goddy looking.",0
5,My granddaughter will love it,1
5,This is a very dainty toe ring.<br />Love it.,1
5,Order a size or two up but I expected that from<br />Previous reviews. Normally a 20 and 24 fit perfect. This was my moms Dirndl but I wish I would have ordered it for me it is so cute. Beautiful embroidery.,1
5,Daughter in law loves them. Wears them all the time. In-laws always the hardest.to buy for. Great success. Would buy again.,1
4,It worked out very well for my Halloween costume as Cleopatra.,1
1,Not worth the time.,0
5,The shortened bill is perfect for park skating and the light canvas material is designed to dry quickly,1
5,GORGEOUS!! It's so lovely I didn't want to take it off. Fit very nice..I was nervous for the arms being too tight but it wasn't I'm 120lbs and got a small.,1
4,"Wow this dress is gorgeous! The print is amazing, the fit is perfect. I took off one star because it DID arrive literally crumpled in a bag, there was zero folding lol, but I have a hand steamer I plan on using. It would be nice for the seller to take a little time and show a little care for their product by folding it. I was concerned because some of the reviews made the sizing sound iffy. I’m 5’2 and 135 lbs mostly athletic build but a bit of a tummy after recuperating from an injury. So I was looking for something flowy to kind of hide my gut haha. I usually wear a small/medium and ordered a small and as I said the fit is perfect. The arms are not tight, it was a scrunched waist to allow for stretching around the midsection. The neckline wasn’t too low, which is perfect.. have a 34b chest so not too much cleavage going on anyways. Since I’m short the dress does drag JUST a bit. It’s not ridiculous. I have a sewing machine, so I may or may not hem it, I haven’t decided. The buttons on the top and at the very bottom are real and the buttons in between are all dummy buttons. The buttons stop at the knee which allows for a nice little peek of skin at the leg. Now, as far as washing. A lot of reviewers said the dress got ruined after going through the machine. As nice as this dress is, it is still very thin, almost to the point of being flimsy (I’m not particularly worried about a slip as I’m attending an indoor shower in this dress, but if going out in the bright sun, you might want to wear one) and it’s also one of those mass made in China relatively cheap dresses. Which should be a clue to you there that it won’t hold up in the wash and dryer, so I will be hand laundering this dress. Anyways, love this dress, the only thing it’s missing is POCKETS! Dresses are always better with pockets!",1
5,"Great beads, great bracelet and we help the big cats to boot!!!",1
5,Nice for everyday wear !,1
1,"Not long enough to wear with leggings. Way too small, not heavy enough to keep you warm. I will just use mine for under a T-shirt so I have long sleeves.",0
5,Good functional case that keep stuff out and quite comfortable also.,1
3,Material was very thin and stretchy. Not very flattering,0
3,They are okay. I wanted to try them but I don't like them.,0
2,"The foam pads were coming off when I pulled out of the plastic, sand and dust does get through. But theyll work for the price",0
1,"The information I reviewed prior to ordering did not provide a compression rating. The promo touted easy on -easy off. I had hoped that the product packaging packaging would provide a rating, but it did not either.  I followed package  instruction to first wash the socks and dry them with NO heat..  Then, I followed the package directions for putting them on.  I struggled for over twenty minutes before finally  getting them on.  I wore them for 9 hours, then thought I was going to have to cut them off with surgical scissors.  This was a very unsatisfying experience.",0
5,They r super cute but when u order boots plz get 2 bigger size like i wear 8.5 so i say select size 10 for boots specially if u order thigh boots,1
1,"I ordered a 38D. No lie, the band on it looked like a 32. I compared it to one of my VS bras and you could tell the difference. Not to mention there is little to no padding in this bra. If you are looking for actual padding look somewhere else.",0
3,"Good construction, a little hard to work with by yourself though.<br /><br />I wasn't able to wear it because my wrists are too large but my friend was, and it worked well.",0
1,They are so thin I have no idea how they think these will keep anyone's hands warm in the winter! Very unhappy,0
5,EXCELLENT FIT FOR ME,1
3,The “jewelry box is broken” unable to use,0
5,"The Cuff is substantial and rugged, a very pleasant surprise.  It feels good and looks even better when wearing it.  I would highly recommend it.",1
3,"Gets the job done, but the plastic gets sticky in a melty kind of way. Not made for the long term?",0
1,Not accurate to pic weird material,0
1,"Waist of money, it’s so low wast",0
5,Great for camping... no mosquitos.,1
5,Stride Rite is the perfect shoes for toddlers,1
1,Really big and material is stiff and doesn’t flow Correctly.,0
2,"Long and comfortable.  The waist band is kinda thick, so it can add bulk. My biggest complaint is quality.  I wore them once and the entire top of my thigh area was pilled. Cant wear out with a cute top. They look worn out already.",0
5,The straps are so soft they don’t hurt.,1
5,Looks just like picture. Very pretty.,1
5,"Love, Love this dress. I live in the Fl. Keys where you need a light fabric because it is always hot. I wore this to a Sunday Brunch. I purchased the mustard yellow, this is one of the most comfortable dresses I have worn in a very long time, the pockets add a little flare. I received many compliments. I am thinking about purchasing again in a different color.",1
3,"Shrunk in length quite a lot. They are more like calf high than knee high now. However, I did put them in the dryer, which I have done with merino wool socks before and never had an issue with shrinkage.<br />Otherwise they are comfortable.",0
2,Very soft but the cut is not at all what is advertised. Took a month to get to me (not worth the wait) supposed to be for women but the cut was for a man. I ordered a large bc I like tank tops to fit big but the neck of this is WAY too small. Definitely not worth it.,0
4,Nice quality but too warm in Ca...thought it would be lighter material.,1
1,"This anklet it very cute and all, but the color will rust after a few days of wearing it, and it broke easily!",0
5,Excellent,1
5,Great dress! So many compliments!,1
5,"This costume was really well made. I was very happy with the quality. Most of the others out there are junk, not this one. Very pretty costume. Love it.",1
1,Very thin & would not fit my hubby's Foot. He wears suze 10 shoe. 😳,0
4,"I usually use &#34;S&#34; or &#34;M&#34; but I ordered &#34;L&#34;, and even then I'm a little bit too tight to be taken into consideration, but the shirts are very comfortable",1
5,My husband likes these!  The belt is another story...he doesn't like this kind of belt.,1
3,its cute but don't like material for shirt and straps don't actually the..,0
5,Very comfortable,1
5,I like this for cloudy days. I have Fuchs Dystrophy and my eyes are worse on cloudy days. They brighten things up. The same for night driving. Also I can sit outside on a sunny day and read. I also have light sensitivity with this problem. So I love these glasses! Very helpful to me!,1
4,It's beautiful! Great purchase and great price!,1
3,"The dresses, are a pretty color, but  they actually, look like a dress,  made out of thin sheets!  I thought,  it was like  a slip type dress, nothing like the pictures, but would be ok, to wear over a bathing suit?",0
5,Really the best push up bra ever made.wish they made swim tops like this.if you want cleavage this bra is for you.its not overly padded like some of the victoria secret bras thd padded is mostly at yhe bottom of the cup which is so much better.its really amazing at the push up this bra gives.,1
1,Be careful. You do not get what is shown in the picture smh.,0
3,"Too thick for my taste.  Thought it would be thinner to wear lounging around, but it's a thick sweat material, so I have not worn it since it's like 80 degree here in California.  Maybe in the winter I will like it more.",0
3,"Too small for me. Otherwise, good glasses.",0
2,It did say women's but I gave them to my 6 year old. Maybe if you are under 100 pounds they fit.,0
5,Looks sexy on her. She loves them.,1
4,"These colorful lanyards have a length of 13.5”.  They do not stretch.  There is a locking “knob” to adjust the length.  You’ll notice that they have black plastic clips on the ends.  These are extremely stiff.  You have to press the mask straps into them.  If you’re using a mask with thin straps, then it’s not as big of a deal. . . but. . . if you’re using a mask with thick straps, then it’s going to take a bit of effort.  These lanyards are individually wrapped.<br /><br />These lanyards are one of thousands being offered by Chinese companies right now on Amazon.  At just over a buck each, the price is not that bad, but be sure to look around for the best price before purchasing.",1
4,"Beautiful top, I ordered a small but the neck part was a bit too big for my small neck.",1
1,I am very dissatisfied with this as I received the item already torn and marked as such with arrows taped to it when I opened it. It is upsetting to think that this was either used or failed qc and then shipped to me.,0
4,"I like them alot, if could change any thing would be to make reading glass part smaller so line between the two was lower in the glasses :-)<br />Great job!",1
5,This is a nice skirt! The material has a ever so slight metallic lime sheen. The fit is very nice. I wear a size 10 pants and ordered a M. Length is good.,1
1,the size does not match are smaller,0
5,"This ones made their job in really cold weather, the only thing you need to have in mind is to order one or 2 sizes bigger than usual as they are very tight.",1
5,"I was not expecting them to actually be comfortable. I have flexible flat feet, causing my arches to hurt in flat flip flops. These are not flat. They have really good arch supports and are very comfortable. The bottle opener was an instant hit at networking function.",1
5,Great glove - very well made,1
5,My Sister loved it,1
3,Love the earring but way to big for daith piercing,0
4,"I bought the blue and white striped dress in Large and it fits perfectly. I have found that the most helpful reviews on clothes are the ones where ladies share their size/body type, so here goes: I am 5'8 and curvy. 175 lbs with 38 DD bust, a big butt and a tummy from having two kids. The drop waist with the draw string really allows for hiding a tummy. With my height and big butt it is a bit short, but I'm ok with that. I've worn it out running errands and also out for beers with my man. It's super cute paired with a fun pair of Chucks.",1
1,"I wore this necklace for a couple weeks, the silver color has worn off in a lot of places and is now pink. And it turns my neck green.",0
4,"My only complaint is that the band's that hold the excess wrist band down do not have the little piece sticking down to hold them in place, so they slide around constantly and I have to fix it. Otherwise great quality and color.",1
5,"For these for my 1.5 year old daughter to keep the hair out of her eyes. They are a great size and stretch well. And will work great cause she has fine hair like I do, so small hair ties were the best way to go. Love the colors!",1
3,Hmm.  I order an extra large although I wear a large and way too small.  Disappointing.,0
2,"So cute, but at least 10 beads have fallen off before I've even had a chance to wear the necklace.  :(",0
5,"My 13 year old daughter LOVES this outfit.  She wanted it for Halloween this year.  We ordered a Medium.  She is 5’3” and weighs 100 lbs.  However, we actually we received a Large instead of a Medium.  It is big on her, but she doesn’t want to send it back in the event the Medium size doesn’t get here by Halloween.  We will just have to use some safety pins to make it work.  The outfit appears to be made with a nice thicker material.  A few of the accessories do seem sort of cheap made, but manageable.  It comes with a wig, which is really nice.",1
5,"As this is a gift, I don't know yet if he likes it. From the photo on line it looked like it unzipped all the way so I was a bit disappointed that it doesn't, but I believe he will still like it.",1
2,"Doesn't look good on, probably because it is too large.",0
3,"I really wanted to love this because of the beautiful color effect. But it is just so wide. If it tapered, it would be an awesome band for females. Didn't have trouble getting it on though, like some others did.",0
2,eye glass frame is very uncomfortable.,0
5,These are the most comfy pants I own,1
1,"I order style F, and instead got what is pictured in my review. Not even close or realistic at all.",0
2,The fabric is what I expected but the size was way off...too small! XXL was more like a Medium.,0
5,I wear miss me all the time and this cut runs a little smaller may want to size up,1
2,Too Narrow,0
5,"Soft. Fit as expected, I got a 2x and it was snug but comedic. If I wanted a proper fit,  a 3x would do. It was used for St. Patty's day.",1
3,"I don't like the material very much, it feels too silky like a costume to me. I think this shirt is somewhat large, but I like it better that way. I'm normally a size large and it fit well. The off the shoulder sleeves didn't like to stay off of my shoulders, they kept coming up and looking more like a scoop neck shirt.",0
3,This scarf has gold sequins and braid in the peacock embroidery.  I don't think it looks as pictured.  Still pretty but very gold sequiny,0
3,"They were very cute but did not hold up. The monster party was peeling off immediately after taking them out of the plastic, so kind of frustrating.",0
5,I am going to buy another one in another color. Great buy!,1
5,The product fit so good. I will by more again,1
2,Broken,0
5,"This is a great watch band for anyone with an active lifestyle! Never worry about bumping, dropping or breaking your watch while you are playing sports, working out, or just living a rugged lifestyle.<br />The bumper fits great and protects the watch very well. The double clasp band makes you feel very secured that your watch will not fail and come loose.<br />Overall i love the feel and style of this band. It also has great color options! I will be getting a couple colors for sure!",1
5,Perfect!!!,1
4,I sized up and it still barely fits. Cute..thin my decent material. Great for the price,1
1,First time I wore them a stone fell out. Second time I wore them the earring separated from the ear wire. I wrote them and they did not respond so I assume they aren't going to do anything about it. I won't buy from them again.,0
5,Looks more expensive than it was.,1
1,In three days finish was off. Could not be shined with a cloth. Too ugly and cheap looking to wear. I did not shower in it or wear all day. Please please don't order.,0
1,"I wanted to love this crop top. I did. I tried and it did not work. The material is not see through at all and does have an excellent stretch, but I cannot over look the fabric choice. It was sort of like a cheap bathing suit material mixed with some cheap costume. Unfortunately, this is just a no.",0
5,Its lit,1
1,"I used this 2 times with 45 pounds of weight for my 5 mile run. On the 2nd time it just fell apart after the first mile. Thankfully I can still return it, but I have to find a box to fit it in, repack it, then take it to UPS, a lot of bull for nothing. It wasn’t worth my time .",0
1,Smelled like garlic bread?,0
4,Love them super cute was unsure about size I can be between 13-14 so I got extra large super big I'm gonn try shrinking but this has lots of stretch n their really dark black  n great lengths cuz I'm 5'6 n i hate when this just right or too short...just perfect  cute to wear with heels,1
3,"I like the turtleneck, but it's too small",0
5,Cute for family gatherings. I would recommend buying one size larger then normal however. All and all we are happy with the purchase,1
5,"As-promised, a sterling silver trinity knot design, nicely packaged, promptly delivered.  My wife loved it!",1
2,"Honestly I’m a bit disappointed. I ordered a large which they’re usually a bit baggy on me and this barely fit. If I lift my arms my stomach is exposed. It’s also made out of almost like sports wear hoodie material. I’m 5’5 and I’m 176lbs so I’m a bigger girl, it hugs my fat which I also do not like. Other than that, the prints look nice and stuff...",0
3,Good quality. Loos the t shirt. And the design. But the size medium is aprox 2 inch smaller than all other standard Medium size. I usually buy Medium. Buy this one is too tight for me.,0
3,Worked great the first couple times I wore them but after just a few washes they no longer stay up.,0
1,Ordered three sizes up based on reviews and it's still too small. Usually a 36 I went to 42 which was the largest they had. The left cup was completely caved in when it arrived. Very disappointed,0
5,"These are lightweight and seem to be pretty good quality! They aren’t annoying and loud like other bangles, which I like.",1
1,I would not recommend.  Graphics are extremely blurry.  The small thumbnail is 100 times clearer than the actual product.,0
1,"This is a very nice silver watch chain. Goes perfect with my watch, and works perfectly. The looks are also very appealing, and looks to be a much more expensive chain. 5 Stars.....Thanks..........",0
3,"Although this bra is comfortable and good looking, the clasp.is difficult to close: its mechanism is tiny and TIGHT.<br />Then, if opened, it becomes extremely difficult close it again!<br />If I use a seam ripper to remove this clasp, will have to replace it with the standard white bra extension piece that has 3 hooks and eyes on it.<br />(I don’t want to stretch the bra back lace by pulling the bra on and off daily.)<br />Replacing this clasp is going to take some time.",0
5,Nice bag for work,1
1,"You only get one necklace with a different picture on each side!!!  Bought for my two nephews, only had one and could not give to either one!!!  Very Disappointed. Picture clearly shows two different necklaces!!!",0
1,"There were a lot of small holes around most of the stitching. Also the blue isn’t nearly as vibrant as the picture shows, more pale, rather disappointing...",0
1,The stock photos and customer review photos have a slightly different design than the one I received.<br /><br />It did not fit right and proportions were off. I wanted to  reach out to the company but could not find a company email.<br /><br />I would return this if I could.,0
5,This is one of the best pieces I now own. I was watching the movie Casino Royale and this necklace is exactly like the original. Comfortable. Shipped and delivery excellent . Thank you!!!,1
5,These items were nice polarized sun glasses for the money.  Great for fishing or driving.,1
5,I bought these after I bought the black pair.  They fit true to the size. Very comfortable. I received them pretty quick too which was nice. Thanks amazon!,1
2,The product depicts the shirt to fit long... when I ordered the product I got a size bigger just in case it fit too tight. Well it didn’t fit tight it just fit like a crop top,0
3,"38D does not stretch across chest.<br />Bright colors and pretty design. Worth keeping, but order up at least one size if not two.",0
4,"This product was great for the price, the material does feel cheap but it is very cute nonetheless! It fit me pretty well although I am small chested (I am 5'5 and 130lbs) . I ended up putting in a request to return this item however, because it didn't really go too well with the boots I bought so that is my fault. The shipment time frame I was given was very vague, it said anywhere from June 20th to July 18th, but it was delivered quickly and ahead of schedule!<br />The underwear/shorts that came with it were extremely small and didn't fit me, I am in good shape and I couldn't get them to stay in place. Plan ahead to find bottoms to go with this if you are considering buying this outfit. These shorts might fit someone who can fit into a size 2 or 3 in jeans. Other than that, no complaints for the price!",1
3,"I'm giving this a 4 star for now.  People complain about the smell, i think it's the neoprene or some type of foam they use which is stretchable and soft like a neoprene, but does give off a terrible chemical smell.  But with that said, if you read the instructions the first thing it says is to thoroughly hand wash in warm water with some mild soap and let it dry thoroughly.  Actually i dont think you can stand one night with it on without washing it, the smell is that bad.  So for a quick review so far,  layed out from end to end is about 28&#34;.  about 4&#34; on each end is velcro so you can figure out if it will fit on your head, it should but with 2-3&#34; on each end to adjust size,  so i'd estimate maybe 23&#34; to 27&#34; adjustment wise?  The material might be like 2mm neoprene but the edges (blue) are sewn so it's like 3mm thick on the edges and stretches.  The chin part has web like portions sewn on the inside, i assume to help it not slip off.  But so far seems to be of decent quality.<br /><br />For my test i will try 2 chin straps.<br /><br />Ok slept with the &#34;other brand&#34; easy sleep chin strap which has a back of the head velcro portion as well and has the bottom contoured so it fits on the chin and around the head nicely.  But the material is thin neoprene so it just puts barely enough pressure on the chin to just hold it closed.  I was still able to snore with this on but it's comfortable as well so i slept easily with it.  It might help reduce the amount of total snoring, but it didn't stop it.<br /><br />I'm testing this chin strap tonight as i just washed it.  Smell is almost completely gone, actually it might be totally gone, nothing offensive in the smell now.  i hand washed it with warm water and a liquid hand soap last night.  I tested it out now as well,  this does keep the chin/mouth closed tighter to the point where i think i have the velcro on too tight, i will loosen it a bit before i go to sleep.  If you think it slips lol,  look at the picture.  Place the bottom under the chin so that just a little bit overlaps the front of the chin.  See how it goes around the ears, but instead of leaving the top strap on the back of the head where you'd think it goes, push it to the back edge of the &#34;top&#34; of your head.  In this position, it held it's position even when  I rolled from side to side.  It didn't fall off even when i rolled from side to side.  So will test tonight and leave an update tomorrow night.<br /><br />Ok, the good news, it didn't slip off at all.  It was comfortable enough so i slept through the night with it on.  But i didn't have it on very tight, but i thought tight enough to keep my mouth shut.  The bad news,  i think i snored just as much as without it haha.  I will test it again tonight and check.  For now i'm going to have to knock down a few stars.  I wasn't expecting a total cure, but i thought it would reduce the amount somewhat.  So down to 3 stars, and will test again tonight. If it seems like it does nothing, i will have to knock it down to 2 stars.",0
2,"I usually like Spsnx as a brand, and love their underwear shorts style (under skits, as skirt slips always roll up, but these did not fit well at all. I guess I should have paid more attention to the word &#34;crop&#34; too. They did not even fully cover my ankles, and at 5'2&#34; I need all the leg lengthening styles I can get.  I will try again with s different style, but for now I am moving them along",0
5,Loved ❤️ IT❗️,1
1,I returned this. First the product description said that this was a red shirt and it is hot pink. It also runs a little small,0
3,This is fine for an everyday maternity dress but it's not made that well and is extremely see-through.,0
5,Very comfortable and fit nicely I wear size 7 shoes. I like the cut and the fact they do not show up and above a low cut shoe.,1
5,"Very soft, too cute, fits perfectly!",1
3,You will see in one photo I have pinched and area of sock... that is all empty space... so if you have thin ankles and wide toes this may work you you... but not a good fit for me...,0
5,"Super cute with just enough room for everything. The many zippered pockets really add to the capacity. My favorite part, though, is the purple lining. Such a nice change from the usual black or brown. Very pleased and would order again!",1
5,"I've bought these socks three different times now. Twice for my husband and once for my Dad. They LOVE them, especially the grips on the heels that help keep the socks up. Would highly recommend.",1
5,Very good,1
1,It is a very dull silver and when I saw the Apple brand it was such a stark contrast because the Apple brand was a beautiful bright silver.,0
5,"My husband was thrilled when I was able to find the same Vasque boots as the old ones the naughty dog chewed on.  They were 1/2 size too big, but when he put in his custom orthortics, the fit was perfect.  After trying on many pairs of boots, it made his day when these arrived.",1
5,Perfect!,1
1,Wouldn't recommend buying this unless your built like a nine year old child. Cheap fabric looks nothing like it did in photos. Waste of money.,0
2,It didn’t look at cute as in the pic,0
5,"We dressed as a character from any book and I chose to dress as ""cat in the hat"" with the stovepipe hat and socks.  Others had on the stovepipe hat, but the SOCKS were the big hit!!",1
5,This shirt fits great and is super comfortable. Probably will order more colors,1
2,Smaller than expected giving the size that was listed as 12” not really true to size,0
5,"Nice socks, good compression, haven't had a chance to wear them on a flight yet, though. I'm sure they will be great when I do.",1
3,"Nice gloves, but I returned them because they were too thick. I would have had to remove them to use any touchscreen electronics.",0
1,"Item description says these are NON-SLIP socks and shows grips on the bottom of the socks in the description.  None of the socks received have grips, these are not non slip.",0
5,Perfect little earrings for everyday wear!,1
3,"Rubber is a bit too thick, perhaps making is stronger in one way, but less flexible.  Eventually it just broke.  Prefer the thinner Hidden Tailor for KY  instead.",0
4,Great Gift idea,1
3,"The velvet is very thick and stretchy. Feels like it would make a really great winter robe, not so great for a dress. Maybe, I just ordered the wrong size and there was just too much fabric. It could be a great dress with the proper fit. I actually would suggest sizing down one if you don’t need too much extra tummy room. The fabric definitely stretches.",0
1,"Was not what I expected. I like my drivers license to be seen and set apart and this wallet does not have a specific pocket for that. Plus, it is smaller than I like and not enough credit card pockets.",0
5,"Absolutely love this dress! I am 5’3”, 158 pounds, I ordered a large and it fits perfect.  The material is extremely stretchy which I was hopeful for & its the kind that doesn’t wrinkle either. Length is right at my knees so it’s work appropriate for me. Definitely pleased!!!!!!",1
1,Very disappointed to find that the tracer tag is half off.  I noticed at the very first use of the luggage.  Not sure if it arrived like that.  REALLY didn't expect that for the price.  Now I have to spend time I don't have to figure out where to get it fixed.,0
5,I love these sunglasses,1
5,great,1
2,Not full enough,0
1,Got this last night. Tightened it as much as I could and still woke up with the back gone... What a waste of money,0
5,"Very nice bodysuit - the only issue for us was that we got a white bodysuit and it's a little too see-thru, so we added an inexpensive tutu from the costume shop.",1
5,Beautiful and came fast!,1
5,Nice to have such a nice looking casual band. Although I love the blush leather that the watch came with I didn't want to wear it while exercising or other situations that may stain the leather. This looks great and it was easy to size. I have a very small wrist (about 6&#34; around) and like a snug fit and this band fits perfectly and I did not even have to go to the smallest fitting. Also like the easy on/off clasp and it is easy to switch between bands,1
1,"Tiny bracelet, like for a child, returned, but, very quick ship.",0
3,Si me agrado,0
3,"After reading reviews saying of your order your typical size, it’ll be skin tight, I thought I should size up. I’m usually a 2-4 in clothes so I ordered a 6, it was way to big and and was super bagging in my waist. Definitely should’ve ordered the size 4. Also, the hook and eye at the top of the zipper gets caught in the crochet/lace and pulls on it, it snagged and pulled part of the crochet off from the seem.",0
2,Downgrading my review from 4* to 2* - one wash and they are too small to wear again. Disappointing<br /><br />Original review: Bought a size up after reading other reviews. Fit perfectly then.<br />Pros: Very flattering on (got an unsolicited “your butt looks good in those pants” from hubby! Lol) pockets are great phone holders!<br />Great color - will likely buy another color.<br />Material thick enough to camouflage most panty lines.<br /><br />Cons: the drawstring is kinda cheap white twine and picked up the color of the pants when I washed them.  A means to secure pockets closed would be nice.,0
5,"I use at work, home and car. Very nice",1
2,"meh - kinda frumpy IMO. It's going back! Maybe it would be better in black. the fabric is thin, slinky and looks cheap, but then again... it is a cheap dress. Great design ideas - but it just didn't hit home. The skirt is short, the waist is high, it's baggy, The color is brighter than what I expected.",0
5,"So soft, true to size, exactly as pictured.",1
2,Fits small bought a large and was snug.,0
1,The plus size sizes are not plus size at all. 1x fit like a medium,0
4,"Fit perfectly when i got it, shrunk a lotafter first wash",1
1,Came broken and was made of cheap plastic. Returned it the day I got it,0
5,Gift,1
5,"I love it! I just wish it was slightly larger, its smaller than I had pictured in my<br />Mind.",1
3,"color is great, length is good, but its tight across my boobs. I got it for a cover up to wear when I get out of the pool, was wanting it loose all over, not snug across the chest",0
2,too small,0
4,Hot form fitting dress!! Hugs my curves and makes and incredible statement!! Total bad ass!!!,1
5,Needed!  Works well.  Would definitely buy more.,1
1,"It's very difficult to size this belt because it stretches. I tried to get the same size I had before, but it is way too long now. I have about that I can't even use!",0
5,Better quality than expected for price.,1
3,"Snugly indeed because of its good adjustment strap.  But everytime I wake up in the morning, my eye snug slipped out of my head already.",0
1,"Poorly made, cheap material. Please don't waste your money.",0
5,These were true to size. They looked great. Lil man loved them.,1
2,These do not block blue light. Cute frames though. But not doing anything.,0
5,Love stary night. Nice plugs,1
5,It is really nice and different.,1
5,Very nice.,1
5,"Love the dresses! I ordered a size small (in the blue AND white!) Some of the reviews said the arm holes are tight, which they are, but it is that way so the neckline stays off the shoulders as described. No need for a slip even for the white dress. Nice lightweight material that surprisingly doesn't wrinkle. I have worn both dresses a lot since I ordered them they are really well made.",1
5,Great bling for NPC bikini competition. Lightweight earrings.,1
3,I really love this bag but after only a couple of months the seams are coming undone.,0
1,"The color is not even close to what is seen in the picture. I ordered the dark purple and it is a tacky, ugly purple in reality. It also has this ugly bunching on the sleeves. It's not a great dress",0
5,cheap and nice for vegas weekend :),1
2,One sock has a tiny hole,0
5,"As someone who lives in yoga pants, I was so happy to find these!  They fit exceptionally well; are a good weight (not thin or sheer); the right length; very comfortable wide waist band and a very wide range of colors to choose from.  I have ordered multiples of these pants and will continue to purchase these in the future!",1
5,Love my new purchase. This long sleeved blouse feels great when worn. Made with soft lightweight breathable materials.,1
5,"Love my new little owl friend, she's beautiful.  What I really like is that the bar is longer than some.  Beautiful and great value!",1
4,It fits well and it is warm enough.,1
4,"It's a thicker, plusher fabric than I'm used to for Bikram yoga, which was my original intent for purchase. Overall feels secure with nice wicking of moisture. The shoulder straps are slightly tighter than I'd like, digs a little, but that's good for my running and more cardio-intense workouts. The color is actually a shade more blue than the pictured aqua. For 32C the size small is just right.",1
2,"If you're thinking the image is accurate, be warned, they're tinged with purple - in my case, one darker than the other.  (?)  They're nicely made, with a notched stud - no basket, so the cone comprising the crystal will bore into your earlobe.  These, I think, will scratch up your phone, so you might consider wearing only one.",0
5,This is an awesome shirt! It was comfortable and got a lot of compliments!,1
5,Love it,1
3,There isn't enough slots for cards.,0
5,nice belt for the money,1
5,Super cute and fits well,1
5,"I needed several dresses for my daughter's wedding weekend in similar colors and I loved this dress but is was shown is black I believe but I contacted these wonderful sellers and there was no problem with the color I wanted. The dress came 21 days before it was expected and the color just pops, I went with coral. I am short 5ft 2in and the back [low] part just barely touches my ankles. All around very pleased with this choice the sellers, the dress, and the service couldn't have been better!!",1
2,The Watch band itself is great.  But I have a smaller size watch face 40mm. The strap edges stick outside the watch case itself.  I gave the band to my mother who has the larger sized Watch.,0
5,"Muy cómodo, impermeable , protege del frío (nieve), excelente compra.",1
1,Dress did not look like the picture,0
3,"I bought the black and it was amazing dress, then I bought the pink, but the quality is different. It’s not the same texture. (And the pink one you can see through).",0
4,The Kurta looks exactly as pictured.<br />The length is quiet long. I got this for my sister who is 5 feet 10 inches tall and it reaches above her ankle.,1
2,If there's a wider one I am thinking of trying it. I hope they sell a wider variety. Cause this one isn't doing it for me. Now I will say it does take your tummy fat away. I just didn't like the fact that I couldn't breathe wearing it.,0
5,Just the right size and color for fall.,1
5,"Love this purse, so cute and just holds my small wallet and a few things. Super soft and cuddly as well when not used as a purse.",1
5,Very fast shipping and I love the dress,1
1,"very cheap looking, not what I hoped for.",0
2,"I love the dress, except that it was too short",0
5,These socks put me in a body bag because they are so awesome.,1
2,"poor stitching, especially on pocket square",0
1,Definitely not long enough to be advertised as a dress.,0
1,Much shorter than expected,0
1,Cheap material not as shown in pics,0
5,Amazing works as advertised,1
4,Material much thinner that expected. I like the neck line though. It cover's my large breast nicely!,1
5,Very nice .,1
2,At the firs time look cheap,0
1,I received this necklace broken to pieces,0
5,Soooo cute!,1
5,No tag so you have to hold it at the neck and see which side dips a bit more! I am 5’0 220 and got an XXL it fits great but don’t drop anything lol it could be worn with leggings or a belt! I love it and wish I grabbed more colors! I WANT PINK!!!,1
3,Quality of product was great but ask for fit it was really small and I got a medium that’s what I normally take and I should’ve got next size up. Would still recommend just order next size up from your regular size.,0
5,Very nice product,1
5,Wore  this for my bday brunch and it looked good! Got so many compliments and looked real fancy!  Skirt rides up occasionally but that’s normal. Would recommend  !!,1
4,"Cute shoes and fast shipping. The only problem is that the heel area comes up super high and gave me terrible blisters when I went on a short 1 mile walk in them. Very stylish, but really only good for light use and aesthetics.",1
3,Runs small for a size large,0
5,"Very nice, loved the color, fit well",1
5,Would recommend,1
1,Wasn't given a size choice they run much smaller then expected and roll down easily not serving purpose of support above the knee,0
5,So cute! Perfect for jewelry making!,1
4,"WISH THEY WERE LOOSER, MORE LIKE SLACKS, BUT FIT JUST HOPE I HOPED--NEW TREND-B",1
1,"If I could give no stars I would, it doesn’t fit me at all it’s very small on me I usually wear a L and a lot of reviews say that it fits m/l so yeah I’d like to return it please thanks",0
2,Much smaller than expected.  Wear as pajamas,0
5,"Loved this dress, looked so cute on me!<br /><br />Material is nice and soft and stretchy.<br /><br />I’m 5’6” and  it was right at my ankle so I could have worn flats if I wanted. Looked best with 2-3” heels.<br /><br />I’m 145-150lbs and got size medium.",1
3,LOVE the earrings.  Great size and quality.  Wires are much wider than picture shows.  Too big and painful to wear.  Will probably return because of that.,0
5,"I'm extremely surprised by the quality of this beanie. I was afraid it might be made of cheap scratchy material (on the outside and inside lining) but it's not at all. High quality, luxurious fur on the inside, and pretty good quality knit on the outside, too. Even the pom-pom fur ball was soft. Totally worth the buy.",1
2,"Very cheap and thin material, but is super cute",0
3,The sleeves are too small for the size of the jacket.  Love the color and style.  I have it to my mother.  It fit her better than me.,0
2,TOO SHEER ONCE YOU PUT IT ON,0
5,"Looks great, excellent deal for the price!",1
5,Bought for my daughter who is 15yrs old 5’1” and about 120lbs. Fits her perfect . Everyone compliments her.,1
5,These are so adorable! I am so excited for my granddaughter to wear them.,1
5,This leo is great quality! Very happy.,1
4,Runs small!,1
5,Soaked in seconds💦💦💦💦💦,1
3,It was kinda big,0
5,It is really soft.,1
5,"Fit perfectly. I knew it was a small and would be a good fit for me after reading it runs small. I'm as Asian female. I'm 5'4"" and weighs 96lbs so this fit me perfect. Had plenty of room to wrap around and tie in the back. Super cute. Looks just like the picture. Love the pocket in the front.",1
1,Great fit yet dose not stand for water resistant be ware,0
5,"It fit me beautifully and the fabric is so soft, I'm in love.",1
3,"Pants good size; fit well. Keeper.<br /><br />However: I had to cut and remove the built-in belt. Big problem trying to latch/unlatch the hook. Difficult.<br /><br />Removed it completely without wrecking the pants, and now using a plastic clip-style belt.",0
5,Love it! Smaller than the Apple Watch band which I wanted! Feels great! And fit my gen 4,1
3,Comfortable  but tight with light socks.,0
4,"Good belts, very cute. I wore the silver one to a wedding and got lots of compliments. The color of the gold one looks a little cheap, but it doesn't bother me enough not to wear it!",1
2,"[[VIDEOID:af808fcceb938e08a7e9441fb1ed86f7]] I normally wear a size L but for this vest I had to order XXL. Big difference.<br />I bought this vest in black, in October 2018 for my trip to Europe in November.  I was totally happy with it but in the middle of my trip I noticed the white stuffing started appearing.  I could pull some of it out but others got to be too long and wouldn't stop coming out.  It popped out throughout the vest and the hood was the worse.  I loved, and still wear it because the length is perfect and its so comfortable.  I want another one in black and maybe Tangerine could come through.  I'm searching for one.  Could you send them this review please.",0
3,"I did not care for the look if it. That's just me. It was light weight and did not have the punch of color or the look I was wanting.  That said,  it may be someone else's cup of tea. Just know that it basically looks like the picture.  The blue is not a solid blue, it has other flecks of color and the white enamel/marble look is too prominent for me in this piece. I needed a more sapphire colored blue.",0
3,"Large Size:<br />Made in China<br />100% Polyester<br />27&#34; length in back (At least 1&#34; too short)<br />34&#34; sleeve<br /><br />No cinch at bottom and elastic is too loose. (I would prefer 2&#34; quality elastic)<br />No inside pockets.<br />Zippered hand pockets, the zipper is upside down probably to prevent it from opening by itself, which means it is probably low quality zipper. (Pocket material is thinner and scratchy, not as warm)<br />Just not warm enough for northern California coastal fog and wind.",0
5,Great socks for winter walking and they look cool too!,1
5,Wanted to mimic Salt straps but without paying the exorbitant price. Has made my 2 year old bag my new fav and I get tons of compliments. Long enough for my long body.,1
5,"Exactly as pictured, work great for me but I have tiny feet. Not too tight, but just enough.",1
5,I bought my husband an xl and it fit perfectly. Very light weight.  Great sun protection and it looks good too.  He was very happy with it.  Great quality. Would recommend,1
5,I loved these earrings.  They were just what I wanted and I had fun wearing them through the St. Patrick's Day holidays.  I liked that I could wear them with any color I was wearing--not just if I was wearing green.,1
1,"The Hoodie itself was soft and good quality, however the mechanics were not! The battery pocket was sewn incorrectly, and the power buttons stopped working within 2 days!",0
5,I struggle most of the time with the “giant calf curse” most compression socks will NOT accommodate- these  ones do and do it comfortably!,1
1,"This dress is gigantic. I’m 5’4, 130lbs and the small was like an unflattering tent with too many layers. The back is also way longer than the front.",0
3,Like the shirt but the letters turned yellow looking after one wash (water is very clear and no issues with any other white shirts),0
5,Simple beautifull!!!,1
5,Super high quality suit! Fit perfectly and I got compliments at the ski resort all day long!,1
1,Crappy. Broke two days after,0
2,This item was NOT handed to a resident!!!! It was laying on the steps-which is okay but the driver should not have lied-he /she probably didn’t want to take a picture of it-it would take extra time. I’m disappointed that the driver would lie!!!!,0
5,parfaite,1
5,"This is such a cool funky dress, I love it! I bought a large because that’s what I usually wear, and it was a bit snug but still comfortable to wear. The material is thicker and will be great in the winter with some tights and booties!",1
5,They are very cute.  Very comfortable on the head.  The antlers are posable.  Would recommend.,1
3,Warm and cozy,0
1,I had to sew the ends to the nose piece and the nose piece was awfully big,0
2,"Chain is too short, would work as a choker unless you have a weirdly skinny neck.",0
2,Not what it is in the picture. It looks cheep as ND like a tablecloth,0
5,"Looks as shown in photos, nice sturdy material & quick shipping. Good value for price paid!",1
2,The masks were too big for my face and were very tight around my ears. the velcro was sturdy though.,0
1,To return the product. Not what i was looking for,0
5,"Just got these and they are so pretty. I wear a 7.5 running shoe and these fit perfectly.<br />I got these for my beach honeymoon. Tried them on today...and They have some weight to them, you can definitely feel them on your feet. The chain seems to be quality but the clasp appears to be a little cheap. If I have any issues I'll update.<br /> For now....I really love these.",1
4,Fits as expected,1
2,"Haven't worn this yet, everytime I pick it up it looses feathers. I hope there are some feathers left by Halloween!",0
1,What is pictured above is NOT what I received. It was supposed to be a zippered pouch and it is not! I’m extremely upset as I was supposed fill them and give them as Christmas gifts this week.,0
5,"This is the perfect accessory for the person who wears a lot of black.  It's durable, shiny, and easy to put on/take off.  Love it!",1
1,The dress could not be made out of worse fabric. It was fraying when I took it out of the packaging. It wrinkles immediately.,0
4,"Too small for the size I'm a 12, I assumed it would be small from experience. So I ordered a 13. And the 13's fit but are tight. Once there broken in they will be great. But now the hurt my toes.",1
5,"As good as I expected""",1
1,STRAP BROKE DURING FIRST USE,0
2,Not as long as i expected,0
4,I double mask it at work and these are big enough and loose enough to sit comfortably over a blue face mask all day long. Plus it hangs around my neck so I can always find it.,1
3,I ordered this charm to fit on my Pandora bracelet. It is to small to slide on my bracelet. Now-I have a beautiful charm that is just sitting in the package.  I wish that this possibility had been explained before I placed my order. I still would like to be able to put a charm like this one on my bracelet because it is my birth stone.,0
1,Broke after the 2nd wear. Sent back for refund.,0
2,Looks cheap.,0
2,"These buttons might work for a child's blazer or jacket, but they are too small to be used for a Men's Blazer.  The buttons are a disappointment.",0
3,Beautiful dress but way too short. I'm 5'0 and this thing was at my crotch! I want to go larger but I am afraid the back length will be too long. Since the dress is styled shorter in the front longer in the back.,0
4,It was shorter than it appeared on the site. I had hoped it to be longer,1
1,Not as pictured. Different shirt than what the other reviewers have... comes up short and I bought a large for extra length. Ended up returning.,0
5,"Comfortable pants, true to size.",1
5,"I have a six year old who is on the small side and has exactly zero bottom. His pants fall constantly, he hates pinchy belts, and I hate his pants dropping while he's running and playing.<br /><br />These are a perfect solution and he adores them. We bought them in multiple colors and he has become known as the suspender kid in his school. He likes the nickname, I like his pants staying up, win win.",1
4,This is perfect for the event I’m attending. Sparkly and sweet!,1
1,Looks cheap!,0
1,"Cheaply made, ties are glued on and all of them broke within minutes of wearing them.",0
5,"My dad bought this hat after it was recommended to him by his brother-in-law during a golf vacation. Due to his history of skin cancer it is vital to keep his head, face, neck and ears protected from the sun and this hat nails it! Also keeps him cool while out in the hot sun golfing. He stops every few holes to soak the hat in cold water and it keeps him cool, comfortable and happy :) My dad is definitely a huge advocate for this protect and is extremely satisfied with his purchase and recommends it to everyone!",1
2,"I absolutely cannot recommend these slippers.  My daughter wears a size 13, the length was fine but the sipper was way to tight to put on and she needed help getting them on and off, she is 5 and a half so she knows how to put slippers on.  They don't have enough give/stretch and gave her red marks.  I would have given them 1 star but they are shiny sparkly and have the look of a great dress up slipper.  Some of the maribu came of during her first time wearing them but I didn't expect that would stay on too long.",0
5,"Mask is perfect, the breathable mesh is the way to go.",1
4,Stays on my face over my N95 mask. 3 more masks and fire to be safe.,1
5,"some folks just don't understand how the fake arrow is possible until removed.  hard to believe, but true.  it's simple, easy, and fun.",1
1,Not what a five year old likes,0
4,I think they are great. My only complaint is I wish they would make a size medium with a larger calf size. I'm just a little over their calf sizing for a medium so I went with a large which fits great everywhere except the foot (I where a size 8.5-9),1
5,I love this dress I was wearing it to a dance for a camp and it work perfectly. If you are look for a 50's dress buy this one❤️❤️,1
3,"These glasses definitely are mirror reflecting glasses, but the color that i had choose, silver, is a bit childish looking.",0
5,"I looooove these plugs!  I got 00, they seem to fit true to size. Perfect quality, awesome deal.",1
4,Good quality.  For some reason they seem to be made for fingers that are maybe an inch longer than mine!  Never had that problem with a mitten before.,1
5,"I’m 5’7, athletic build with a long torso, narrow hips, thin core, strong legs and butt.  The crotch is a little long and the length might be slightly short, but overall they are adorable!!! I got many complements and look forward to wearing them again.",1
4,Rings still looking like new and I'm an er nurse and my husband does construction a good buy,1
5,This was the perfect graduation gift. The sentiment was just right. The gift was well loved.,1
3,"My loving husband bought me this dress. It was actually pretty cute. However, it chokes my neck whenever I try to sit. Sadly I waited too long to return it. I doubt I'll wear it again. It's great if you plan on standing the whole time otherwise. Neck is the only area where it doesn't really stretch.",0
1,"I received 1 bra (Navy blue) out of the package of 3, I looked at all my other packages, but there not nothing, but that one bra in a wrapping by itself.  I am not sure what could have happened to them.  I would have love to write something much better, because I do like the style of the one bra that I did receive. I would like for someone to contact me.",0
1,I was not able to unzipped it because the zipper handle was sewn over it. Had to rip it carefully to get handle out and unzipped.  Somehow the handle is inside the dress.  Dress is more orange red and was huge on side of chest.  Very short in front and if I lift my arms u can see everything. Im 5'6.  I complained and requested a refund due to zipper issue.  They only refunded $3 for inconvenience.,0
1,"The  zipper broke the first wearing, very disappointing.",0
5,Super cute belts and durable too for the price. I've had mine for eight months and its still in pretty good shape.,1
4,"I love this skirt so much, but it is not for small waists. I have to wrap it around more than normal and then crisscross the strings to hold it up.",1
5,So cute!,1
1,The clasp continuously slipped off glasses. Very annoying! Will not recommend!,0
2,just after a month it started to check color,0
2,"After 1 week, it fades ALOT<br />I do not recommend, unless you're wearing this only once..",0
1,"DISPOSABLE :(((<br /><br />Bad quality, the fabric ripped easily, the embroidered applique peeled off and also my top arrived with a hole in the back. Very pretty but disposable.",0
5,EVERY VALENTINE'S DAY I GET MY HUSBAND A BOTTLE OF POLO...WELL THIS TIME HE HAD ALMOST A FULL BOTTLE SO I CHOOSE TO GET HIM CLOTHES INSTEAD. THIS IS A GREAT SHIRT...EXCELLENT QUALITY AND THICK ENOUGH TO WEAR ALONE...CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE!!!,1
5,Gtrst glasses.,1
2,"I just received and tried on.  The waist band is no more than a 1inch piece of elastic.  The fabric is thin and stretchy but without compression.  I am 5'8"" and about 175lb so I ordered an XL thinking I would need to size up from my normal size of large.  I may have felt like there was more compression if I ordered a Large...but I doubt it because the material is too thin.  I do 25-30 minutes of HIIT workouts every day at home and I wanted to try some longer shorts than what I currently use, but these won't provide me with what I need.  These are an inexpensive set, so I knew I was taking a risk with ordering them.  I might consider keeping them for ""lounge-wear"" shorts, but I would rather get my money back.  I will be returning them.",0
2,They don’t hold up with the bra to absorb sweat.,0
5,Beautiful earrings at a reasonable price.  I'll probably end up getting a pair containing each stone offered!,1
3,I dislike that the cord the stone came on  didn’t last more than a week wearing and taking off before showering. Stone appeared to have white specks all over. Not worth the hassle to return.,0
1,Warning this is not an authentic Pandora charm!,0
2,It's hard to clip into the fitbit.,0
4,Very light and comfortable dress. Great for casual wear or as a cover up.,1
5,"Never really thought these were going to work but after the reviews, thought we'd give them a try.  We had an overnight at 1 hotel before our vacation so were able to pack everything we needed in one cube and the rest of our stuff in the others.  Keeps everything really organized and didn't have to pull everything out of the suitcase to be repacked.  Definitely worth the cost to keep everything organized with easy access.",1
5,Was a little big in bust but with adjustable shoulder straps it helped it to fit better.,1
5,Very satisfied. The dimensions were as expected and works really well for what I envisaged.,1
5,Love them. Very light.,1
3,Look good. Fit is a bit too tight tight even for women. Made for smaller head,0
3,So when I open my package it was awesome. Love the shirt and pants. Pants fit great. The blouse around the head was a wee bit small but maybe my kids gas a big head. The fabric isn't stretchy which is helpful for most kids. She said wear the set once. It the shirt shrunk and does t go over her head. Other then that I do like this set.,0
1,"It was a good sized back pack. The zipper was poor quality, very hard to open. WORST of all is that it had a super strong synthetic plastic smell that would not go away. It was quite offensive. Left in garage for over a week thinking it would go away, but it did not. Had to return.",0
2,picture and product were different.  Returned it. Looked like pajama's.,0
1,"It looks like a dark red, it looks really nice on here, but it doesn’t actually look like that, its  light red and it just doesn’t look the same at all, it looks basic, like a watch from walmart for kids",0
5,Actually wanted to return these because i got them instead of the plain cotton but these are so comfy! I thought they'd be slippy cause they're satiny but they stay put great!,1
3,as promised but two of the colored beads fell out the first day I got it,0
1,"Do not buy from this seller - not from 4ocean. Didn't have the correct closure, I had to tie it on. Then broke into a million little pieces.",0
5,ABSOLUTELY love these sunglasses! The mirror effect is quite insane and they are great for my wider face!! Love the whole look!,1
5,"I LOVE THIS BRA. I wore it out with a backless shirt and all of my friends now refer to it as “the wonder bra.” Two of them got it immediately. The adhesion will definitely get you through a sweaty first wear no problem, but does become a little less secure on the edges if you store it to wear again. I recommend keeping the plastic backing and just sticking it back on after each use.",1
2,"First off, I was very excited to purchase this dress and when I got it’s delivered today I was excited until I saw the packaging. The packaging is terrible!!! I was very disappointed in the packaging. Just packed it in a PAPER envelope and stuffed the dress in a small clear plastic bag. Even thuo the dress didn’t not fit me I love the material it’s was heavy enough to endure through winter the length of the dress is amazing. But the packaging you guys have to do better. I have to return this in VERY DISAPPOINTED!!",0
4,Look nice but personally I’m terrified of accidental swallowing the magnet so I’m not using it but cute for pictures,1
4,This dress is super cute! Fits as expected. You could even go down a size because it's so flowy. You can dress it up or down. I took a star away because the strap ripped the first time I wore it but I was able to sow it pretty easily.,1
3,They are larger than the picture depicts except for the leaves. Those are the only ones I can wear,0
4,"Good bras, fit a little smaller than I expected, so at the end of the day it can feel like it’s digging into my skin a bit. But overall comfy, great for everyday wear.",1
3,"The pattern on the front is exactly the same on the back so it's hardly a world map. Plus it was really small; I got it for my girlfriend, she's pretty short but it was still really small",0
5,Very happy.,1
1,I ordered a size you up but still tight. Not my favorite purchase.,0
3,"Poor quality, high price for 1 pair of boxers",0
5,Wear these working and hiking ! Absolutely love them and at half the price of the law enforcement pants I bought previously. Give them a try !,1
5,Love the material. It fits as expected. Wrinkles pretty badly though in wash.,1
1,Runs large. Cheap Matteo,0
5,It was a 10 year old girls Birthday present.,1
3,"It provided great compression. True to size. However, after washing it in the washer, threads started coming out from its seam.",0
3,"Odd fit, really gaps in the back",0
5,They look good,1
1,I am literally appalled at the quality of these pants!  I have worn these only twice and I noticed the fabric has already thinned looking like black pantyhose!  Soooo embarrassing and after a total of about four hours of wearing them!!!  Should be called DISPOSABLE pants!,0
3,"Super cute cut, but REALLY SMALL! I have a large bust and I got an XXlarge and its still too snug around the shoulders! Its a shame because its really nice otherwise. I love the 3/4 sleeves.",0
2,"I was in love with these on initial use. I was ELATED to have my 36 in softloc extensions out the way. This is my second time having this style and while it is beautiful, it took me a year to do them again because sleeping and showering was a nightmare. But These bonnets saved the day.  I have a braiding shop, and these long locs are one of my most requested, so I was even recommending these bonnets to people. THEN, not even a week after the first day, the first bonnet I opened ripped down the back seam. At first I was like ok maybe it’s something that I did, maybe I accidentally snipped it when I opened the package. The rip was small and it was no big deal. Then it gradually got wider until it was big enough for locs to start hanging out. Still, No big deal as I still had two left. Opened another one. Same thing happed in the same place. Now I’m on my 3 bonnet in less than a month. Not to mention the band loosened up around the head so now it slides down during the night. I thought I was getting a deal turns out I was getting exactly what I paid for; A CHEAP MESS. The two stars are only Bc they did/do really help until they start disintegrating.",0
5,good qua;ity,1
4,"my bf loves this hat, although i must complain that the color in the picture shows the golden khaki color on the front panel and what i received was bright yellow. it fits a bit loose, it raises up off his head and makes him look like hes wearing a trucker hat. other than that its a great hat!",1
2,Smaller than thought it would be.,0
1,This are very good looking but cheap made pants! This is the second pair of pants I ordered first was too big and the threads between the legs were open and now this one fits but after 5 minutes into wearing  I realized between the legs were unstitched!!!<br />Waste of time and money.,0
1,Magnets not strong enough to keep laces together with normal movement,0
5,"The dress is as described. The material is soft, light but not see thru. It fits right at the waist and is right at the knee in length. Got a lot of complements when I wore it. I ordered medium for my 5'4"" 135 small frame.",1
3,"I love how the shoes are flexible and easy to get on and off my child's feet. However, the material wore out pretty fast and got holes in the toes. It could be because my child wore them a lot, pretty often, and grips with his toes. I enjoyed them while they lasted, but am not repurchasing.",0
5,"I hate walking on bare floors, and lately notice that I need some cushioning with my shoes.<br />These slippers are so comfortable, fit perfectly and are cushy.<br />The only complaint I have, if one could even call it that, is they are too warm.  I am going to love these in the winter more than I do now.",1
3,"It's a very warm hat . I admit that I have a big head. If I had my hair out I would not be able to wear the hat,",0
4,The hat is super cute and much better quality than I expected.. only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is they don't pack it well and it came warped.. I even have a head form but unfortunately it's not fixable.,1
4,"So I got this Raiden shogun cosplay for a con, mostly because it was the only one that would come in on time. Overall, it’s a great cosplay! Only things I really have to complain about is the bow, and the tights. The back bow is huge and completely weighs down the obi part, making it fall off. The tights are literally paper white. (I had to color them with foundation to match my skin.) The material is great though!",1
1,Poor quality. Ear straps break and interior pocket falls apart after a few uses.,0
1,These are not for shaping/compression  or working out in! It’s super thin material and you can see through. It reminds me of a thin sleep shirt which is what I’ll be using them for,0
5,Great little Frankenstein! Just received it. Very detailed and cool!  Love it!,1
5,I ordered a small fit a little big not too tight. Great quality and very comfortable.,1
1,"It is absolutely adorable and I wanted so much to love it, but the material was itchy on my skin and the thread is already coming apart not even 24 hours later. I’m returning it.",0
3,"This dress is very very pretty, however it was too small and very long. Such a shame, I would've been lovely for the occasion",0
5,"During the summer I developed problems with one of my ankles.  It would hurt so bad I'd be limping at work than it would seem to clear up only to come back a week or 2 later.  Finally I gave up and saw a doctor about it.  He had me put wedges in my heel and use a brace at night.  That has helped tremendously.  He had said my achilles tendon was getting irritated by a pronounced heel spur that I had.  When I knew I was going to need some new shoes (which meant I needed more wedges) I saw these and decided to give them a try.  I put the foam insoles in my work shoes that tie and the gel ones in my dress shoes.  They have both been very comfortable to wear and helped keep my tendon from getting irritated (again).  I did receive these at a discount for giving my honest opinion on them.  I didn't get them to become taller, but to lessen the work my tendon did while I was at work (as I'm on my feet all day) and they worked great for me.  My feet feel good (as does my ankle)- they are much more comfortable than the wedges the doctor started my with- these are much more comfortable on my arches.",1
5,Is as advertised,1
2,"The wave colors are only on one side as the back side is solid white.  It will work for my craft project, but calling these ""Murano-inspired"" is like calling this review Shakespeare-inspired.",0
1,"These fit well and seem true to size. However, the first time I wore the black one, the underwire poked out from the lining and cut my boob. Ouch.",0
5,"I ordered the blue plaid color and when I wore it, i was flooded with compliments.  This dress is nice and flowy. I felt this dress really complimented my body well. Great purchase.",1
5,"WELL MADE, THIN, WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED. WASHES WELL. NOT TOO TIGHT AT ANCLE, BUT STAYS UP.",1
5,It fit perfect.  It true to size.,1
5,Excellent purse,1
4,"Loved the style and the way the earrings fit! However the clasp for one of them is very weak and will not stay shut, so I risk losing one if I wear it. If it wasn’t for that, I would give five stars.",1
5,love it,1
5,works well,1
1,"Terrible fit! Again, they are obviously foreign made. Very disappointed!",0
5,Looks great and is holding up well over the California summer. I already have the Texas state flag so I was glad to find this one - more original.,1
1,Not what I expected,0
1,It smell bad when I got this,0
1,These do not fit the Oakley Crosshair 2.0. The pads sent have a plastic post in the middle whereas the original pads have a hole that fits onto a post on glasses.  Will return and look for others to purchase.,0
1,I definitely was not pleased,0
5,Comfortable and beautiful!  Really pretty bra and very comfortable.  Highly recommend.,1
5,Nice product,1
1,"This is the worst invisible bra ever. When I got it I was excited because the look is good, so I assume the quality won't be too bad. I couldn't be more wrong cuz it doesn't work at all. The size fit good, but when I walk around in my room and bent to grab something, it just got lose and fall off! And then, I found some small things look like jelly stick on my chest! How disgusting!!! I haven't wear it for 10 mins and it's already broken.",0
4,nice bag but i have to wash it has weird smell.,1
5,"Great glasses, color are accurate to pictures and it comes with a small hardshell case and microfiber cloth for your lenses.",1
2,"Looking at the photo, I thought the fabric would feel and look more like a very light knit.  It doesn't.  It feels more like inexpensive polyester. The sizing was also an issue.  I ordered a small which fit more like a very roomy medium.  It's long, but if you are between 5'4"" and 5'6"", it's doable with heels.  I just don't like it enough to keep it.",0
4,Fit as expected.  What I expected for a cheap shirt 3 stars.  Have it an extra star for the side pockets.  I got the red and black.,1
5,"Bought this without an occasion, just wanting to add a LBD to my wardrobe. This dress had no picture reviews or real size reviews but I’m glad I took the risk. And I’ll include my sizing info at the end. I tried to include photos but the app didn’t give me the option?<br />The material is stretchy without being cheap and very flattering. The only negative thing I will say is if you have a small waist you’ll notice extra fabric around the waist and lower back that kind of bunches up. Other wise it has adjustable straps that make it friendly for larger bust sizes and it’s long enough that it’s not inappropriate or hoochie at all. In other words it’s sexy but classy, the perfect LBD.<br />I’m 5”9, 180 lb, size 10 in old navy jeans, 36 DD. I ordered a size Large and it fit with plenty of room to move around in.",1
4,lovely. glad I bought it,1
4,"It’s ok just too tiny it fits like a 2, I’m a 4, it’s more like an extra small",1
5,I bought and use this apron for weed eating keeps me from getting all grass. The apron is thick and should be long lasting.Cleans up easy with garden hose.,1
5,"Well made, correct size",1
5,"Love it, very classy, runs a little big on my 8 year old but will be ordering more colors.",1
1,Sent item back due to non matching color. There is no red tint on the necklace.,0
5,Sexy dress!! I love it. I'm 5'9 and 188. My measurements are 38-33-45 and it fits perfectly.,1
5,Gorgeous necklace! Just as pictured. Nice size. Sparkle sparkle sparkle! This is my second purchase with this designer...purchased the bracelet to match and will make for a lovely set. ONLY negative...wish this came in a bigger box. The necklace does not lay round...seen in pictures...hoping once it's worn it will lay correctly...Nice purchase otherwise.,1
2,"This is one of those ""one size fits most"" so unfortunately if you have Large hands, this will not do. It was very tight and uncomfortable for me to wear and handle. My thumb felt squished and it was tiring just trying to move the fingers around.<br /><br />In addition, it was very slippery that I needed to handle my glass dishes with extra care. The scrubbers didn't suffice and it was much easier to use a sponge.<br /><br />I returned this product and bought my regular playtex gloves which work 100 times better. Good concept, but they need to make it less slippery and also should include real hand sizes, not just one size.",0
1,Second wash and there’s a hole already.,0
1,"It looks short, it came to my knees. It was too big and looks like I’m wearing a sack. May be cute if you add a waist belt. I kind of hate it. Probably will not wear it.",0
1,Tie strings are not placed right... and dress came with a huge whole in the waistline... very cheaply made!!!!,0
1,Not as nice as is pictured. Floppy latex mask that looked like beast got hit in the face with a shovel. Ill fitting and could not see out of the eye holes. Returned it.,0
1,Too big,0
3,Nice,0
5,Many compliments on this purchase,1
5,"This dress is so darling. There were some wrinkles when it arrived, but that was the way it was packed. After a light wash, I wore it to the event I purchased it for, and I got so many compliments! It's classy and sexy without showing too much skin. Love it!",1
5,"These are a gift for our granddaughter, for her 16th birthday.",1
4,Preschoolers love these !!!,1
5,Nice ..,1
2,"It will hold a hat’s re-shaping, but over time the very thin nozzle clogs, any nothing comes out.",0
5,A traditional and comfortable hoodie - how can you not love it??,1
4,"They don't ride up, and help keep you dry.",1
5,Seller is sweet. Product is good quality and packaging was very well done. Came with extra rings and closure just in case and a nice little storage bag. Buy from this seller (and I definitely did not get paid to say that). Great experience and product.,1
5,Wife loves the hope in the shirt.,1
2,Even at the price I purchased this hat at it is not worth the price,0
5,Wore it to my firm's Ugly Christmas Sweater party...it was a HIT! It's very thin so a spanx or cami maybe needed.,1
4,"It is very nicely made and the color is beautiful. One thing, the set feels mismatched size-wise, the top is rather Med size and the shorts are true to XS, and actually the waist elastic band is too tight, so I had to replace it.",1
5,I initially bought the Sun flower dress. I still need to post the pictures and I loved it so much I ordered the Halloween one. Today we went to the pumpkin patch with our kids and I received alot of compliments on how cute it was. Good quality and comfortable for the price,1
5,Looks great.  Exactly as pictured.,1
5,Great for the price and polarized,1
5,"I was quite surprised at what good quality this has. None of the jewels are missing and the material is good and solid. Don't like the chain and it's too short, but I was planning on putting my own on it anyway. Delivered on time. Definitely recommend.",1
5,"Well made , very good product .",1
5,love it,1
1,Not as shown in picture. It shows the neck front at above the cleavage. Is exact sz but was made that the neck opening was clear down to below my breast.  Not manufactured correctly,0
5,Definitely long enough to wear as a dress,1
3,Muy bonito pero para mi es muy pequeno,0
3,Found sole uncomfortable. Had to return.,0
1,TOO SMALL...XL! I am upset that this Jacket Size is a XL for a Jr. TEEN...NOT A WOMAN SIZE XL!!! I gave it to my Daughter!,0
5,Daughter was very happy with her softball stuff!,1
4,kid loves it,1
5,Great buy fit perfect!,1
5,I get so many compliments on these earrings! We make balloon animals at work and they are a huge hit. They are kinda of heavy to wear everyday,1
5,They for perfect,1
4,"GOOD SOCKS 10.5 &,11 WIDE  NEED THIS  XLARGE SIZE TO FIT",1
5,"Purchased for a birthday present, they loved it, so I love it, thanks.",1
4,My daughter is going to college and loves pin up style dresses so I couldn't wait for this to arrive.  It arrived within a week which was much quicker then expected.  The material is a bit thicker then expected but still flows very nicely and is breathable.  It is true to size and the colors are bright with bold patterns.  The only reason it is not a 5 stars from me us that the neckline is  looser then expected.  She is very happy with it and I will be buying more from this company.  I ordered a size medium.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.,1
5,I love the detail. My little granddaughter will easily identify this as a cheetah! This looks better in person than when I ordered it.,1
2,Looks nice but is actually smaller than the given dimensions. As described it should be 11.8 inches long. It’s only 9 inches. If interior was as described 10x3.15x14 inches. My 13 inch laptop. 9x11 inches should fit. It doesn’t. I’m returning.,0
1,Too small.  Rollerblades wont fit in there,0
5,Works well.,1
3,these really squeeze my fingers and toes in any position that puts tension on the palms of my hands or balls of my feet,0
3,"It's a cheap dress, so you shouldn't be shocked that the quality isn't great.  But, for my needs (a costume), it was fine.  Color is accurate.  Hem was a little uneven.  Pockets.  Soft, stretchy, and a bit see-through.",0
5,"This is very cute, and very well made. It fit my daughter just as expected.",1
4,There is a small area at the end of one of the zippers that is not stitched properly. It is not so much a problem to have to send it back.,1
3,the product is excellent. the fabric is very nice. good details.<br />the only drawback I had is that the blue flannel came with many white spots.<br />Greeting .,0
5,👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽,1
5,"These pajamas are my new favorite and I am ordering more tonight, they are super soft and warm!!",1
3,I needed sleeves for a dress and this did the trick.  It is a thin material.  It fit as expected.  If suited the purpose I bought it for.,0
5,Absolutely love my new purse!,1
4,Beautiful,1
1,"I've had an apple watch for years now and I've never had a band break before. Not only did this one break, but another band just like this broke as well. Sent them both back!",0
1,Not as pictured. I got some butterfly necklace.,0
4,The quality is pretty good for what you pay. It arrived faster than expected and it's just like the picture.,1
5,Serves its purpose,1
1,The fabric was to thin,0
5,Bello,1
1,"I’ve had this band for 5 days and it’s faded already! It’s cute, but it doesn’t last! Super disappointed!",0
1,Cheaply made.  Very small.,0
3,"The size fits as expected, but it thought it would lay differently.",0
2,Color is clearly brown not black and smells like mildew,0
4,The mask I received was very similar to the one ordered as you can see from my photo. I do like it but would rather it look more like the one in the marketing photo. Even though my head is large the mouth and tongue are huge.,1
1,Once was did get the same anymore.,0
1,poor quality,0
2,This is a very unique ear cuff BUT beware as the item is much smaller than pictured even with the dimensions given you still won't be able to figure out how it will look on YOUR ear until you receive it.,0
3,its good and matches my purse; its also genuine leather,0
5,Precious,1
3,Product is overpriced.  I love the art but socks ar extremely tight for a person who is a size 12 men's,0
2,"They are very warm and comfortable. Unfortunately the graphics are not done well. Mine were worn twice, then washed, and after you can barely see the images. You probably get what you pay for with these. They were fun for a couple of days, and now they’re going to be donated or thrown out.",0
1,Very cheap,0
5,I got this for a Hamilton Officer Mechanical. The color isn't a cheesy green and the construction is very good. Especially for the money. It comes with springbars but theyre so thin I wouldn't recommend using them.,1
5,you will truly love this product very much and more...,1
3,the compress shorts underneath were to loose.,0
5,"I was so happy to find I could wear this choker, like a choker should be worn, which is almost mid-neck, not lower because it feels too tight.  I can't even explain why, it just fits great!  Got tons of compliments!  And refused to say how little I paid for it.  LOVE IT!!!!  And, it's adjustable!",1
5,"Like the yellow color and the fit was just right on me, actually if it was a tad bit smaller I would have been ok with that too.",1
2,Very bad quality. I have worn it about 5 times and its already coming apart.,0
5,Beautiful Color!  I love them ! My favorite color studs! Super Shiny !! I lost a few so I’m buying some more ! ❤️,1
3,I like baggy and comfy but this was a bit much,0
5,"That simple light & breezy summer dress. Lots of comfort, uses and compliments. Size small fit a 5’ 2” 110 lb frame perfectly.",1
2,did not like the fit,0
5,Great socks. Wouldn't wear anything else to walk/run in.,1
1,Nothing,0
5,These clip onto the Xbox One controller with ease. I'm using them for the Project Xcloud beta test. They hold your phone and connect to the controller nicely. It's also a plus to have the kickstand on them for setting the controller down for a break. Haven't had them fall over or break holding my phone. Very well balanced.,1
3,Nice hat but kinda small,0
5,"My church purchased this shirt style for an anniversary promotion.  It was so comfortable and well-fitting, I wanted some more.  I found the style and brand on Amazon.  I ordered 3 different colors of this style, and have been very pleased with all three.",1
5,great quality,1
5,Love it fits everything just right!<br /><br />Color is beautiful and bright,1
5,"OMG I love these shoes - they fit perfectly. It took awhile to get it, but they were worth it. I usually do not purchase shoes on line, but I am sooo glad I did. I'm a size 9.5 I got a 10. I'm glad I did.",1
1,Arrived broken,0
4,They look great. They are too big for my head. The ear curve is about an inch past my ear.,1
5,"Just what my husband needed for yard work and home projects. Nice size, stretch and absorbency.",1
5,"Bought these for my employees who have arm tattoos, which are not allowed.  They fit everyone from a tiny woman's arm to a 6'5'' muscular man.  I am told they are very comfortable and breathable.  Great value for the price.  highly recommend",1
5,"This is a cute red dress. It is perfect for Christmas holiday time. The fit is great, especially hide some extra weight during the holiday season :) I love the dark red color. The length is great for me.  The dress looks flattering on me and I got a lot of compliments especially for the color. I recommend this dress.",1
4,"VERY NICE, SOFT",1
3,Cute and comfy,0
3,"This item is a ""one size"" fit. That works OK for me because I am petite. However, it won't serve for a large woman. The length of the sleeves and the body of the sweater are very short. The buttonholes are too small, and it is hard to close. It is very soft and is a pleasing color, but this is barely a functional size for a real woman.",0
1,they came and they were like i had cut some old leggings like and they where to long and very see thru,0
5,This set is hands down the best I’ve ever purchased - from anywhere! Extremely flattering and comfortable!,1
5,Perfect,1
4,I purchased these for the color and the fact that they're thin. They allow my feet to breathe.,1
1,"it broke within seconds of my son attempting to put on, very poor leather quality",0
5,"Got this for my wife. She absolutely adores it! Great quality you expect from Polo. Goes with everything. Believe me, this will be the most used bag in your inventory!",1
5,"Perfect fit, highest quality!",1
1,Do not buy these! Total waste of money. Cheaply made and easy to tear,0
1,"This dress is way too small, and VERY SHORT! I don’t like the material either, feels itchy.",0
5,Great product quality. Nice and warm.,1
1,Takes up more space than if I just put my stuff in ziplocks. Not practical,0
3,"Need a large one. XL would fit too small for my size. Can't get a new one it would cost to much. I got a L one and its to small, what I need is a XL large one, but i cant send this back cause it caused to much.",0
3,Wood grain missing. Looks odd. Kept because unique. But poor quality control.,0
3,"Falls out of ear. Need to wear a backing, but with threaded I shouldn't have to.",0
5,🥰PERFECT,1
1,"The item came quickly, but as I took it out of the package I noticed one of the straps was busted. I tried it on to see if I should exchange it, but it is extremely small (short) and I have a very short torso. Not recommended.",0
3,"Nice bra, sticky effect does lessen after a couple hours. Comes in a nice protective case to store it in.",0
2,"I purchased this dress for our xmas pictures this year. I am 5'7 and weight 165 pounds and ordered a L. This dress was very unflattering on me. I have an hourglass shape, but the dress just didn't look right on me. The belt is the only thing that gives this dress any shape to it, other than that it look like a paper sack. The material was a little tough, but may soften with washing. The shoulder and sleeves were tight when I moved my arms. Gave this dress a 2 star because I don't think the size measurements are accurate. Returned.",0
1,Don't but this piece of trash! The rhinestones are hideous! This bracelet will not fit you unless you have Popeye's wrists!,0
1,I should have looked closer at the picture.  The hour hand is not over the luminous ring.  You won't know what hour it is.  Why would anyone design a luminous watch like this.,0
2,This item will be returned shortly.  The dress is not cut to size.  It is extremely short waisted.  Print is nice tho.,0
3,"Slippers were comfy for the first few weeks and then the padding squished flat to be almost imperceptible. Which would not be so bad if the plastic sole wasn't so hard and unyielding. Fast forward 6 months and holes appeared under the ball of the foot portion of the sole, which felt perpetually like a nail was sticking into my foot. Would not buy again.",0
4,"I didn't realize that this dress had pearls trimming the collar. This was a pleasant surprise; however, I think a different material should have been used. It's difficult to iron the cotton collar and not burn the pearl accents.  That's my only issue with the dress.  I received many compliments and this was a great price for this dress. The delivery was only about 2 days too. Love it!",1
5,Cute. Goes great with my jogger jacket,1
3,Powers way to low on it. Needs a much stronger output,0
2,"This hat cannot be returned so make sure you like tacky before you order it!<br />The quality of the hat itself is good however it is very gaudy and tacky with way too much pearls , gold  rhinestones and sequence which does not show in the photos.<br />And trust me I have many hats and I love bling but if you’re going for tacky this is the way to go!",0
5,Very fashionable,1
5,I love them 🤗,1
5,I love it!,1
3,"Missing a few correct sizes and too many of other sizes, but the ones we did get were ok",0
2,It's a useful product and design is elegant but parts came damaged.,0
5,"It's pretty. Fabric is clingy and smooth. Sleeves are long enough. I'm 5'6 1/2, 25-26 waist and long arms and legs. The hem covers my butt so I could wear it without leggings but I won't bc my legs are so long. I ordered 2, the wine and the black colors size small. Wasn't disappointed at all. I'll order more!!!",1
5,VERY BEAUTIFUL.,1
5,So cute. Good quality. Fit as expected.,1
2,"Let's just say that someone this Christmas will love this shirt @ goodwill...brand new w/ tags. Lol, even my 4yr son said he thought it was ugly and to get rid of it.  It doesn't look like the picture at all and it's way too big for me. Oh well, someone could use it, but definitely not me. Oh and the shipping was horrendous...I forgot I ordered it, thats how long it took.",0
1,Ordered an adult large and it’s so small it could be a woman’s or child’s size. I asked for a return and they’re only refunding $7.70 of the $24.95 purchase price. Unsatisfactory!,0
1,They look good but they break so easily not worthy wasting money on it,0
3,"Super cute jacket, extremely cheap materials",0
4,"Yes, my headline says cheap and flimsy, but I still gave 4 stars. The jacket was $18.99, so I expected it to be cheap and flimsy. But as long as it does not tear up in the wash or shrink, I will keep my rating at 4 stars.",1
4,Worked as advertised. :),1
5,Bought this for my daughters birthday and she just loves it! They are huge Disney Fans and she works primary with children so this was a huge success! Seems to be of good quality!,1
3,I liked the value for the price but the chain is too short.,0
3,"This shirt looks much better on the picture then it does in person. In real life this is just a regular, but loner, T-shirt. Printing is also not as atractive as on the pic. I not am retruning this item but I am NOT impressed at all",0
3,"I ordered a Reversible Black/Brown.  Received a belt with no black on either side. I received a belt that was brown on one side and a bright brownish color on the other side.  Regretfully, I'm sending it back. I need the black and brown. Too bad because I really liked the quality of the belt I received.",0
5,"Super cute, makes a great gift. The crystal is bigger then expected too. Buy it!",1
5,My mom is an elementary school teacher and wore there for spirit week and they were a hit! Worth the splurge,1
5,Great birthday gift husband loved these for church and work meetinigs!,1
5,"I really like it its very flattering, light weight but not too thin, I am usually small but I ordered medium for more relaxed fit and it looks great",1
3,"Very beautiful and worked great with my outfit.  However I lost it the first night I wear it.  It slipped off, doesn't stay on well.",0
1,Earrings are awesome the necklace fits extremely small this is for kids the bracelet is nice it can be a necklace,0
5,Tgis bag is constructed well. Lots of pockets and features.  Def worth the money.,1
1,Probably the least flattering dress I have ever tried on. I am 5’3 and it hit mid calf- which poked horrible with the layers. The arms were too tight; and the bust too big. It’s being returned as I write this review.,0
5,"Dress fit as expected. Got it in red and color is vibrant and just like the picture. I'm normally a large so I got it in an XL as I figured I could take it in if too big but can't take out if too small. As far as length, upon taking it out of bag it came in, I thought it might be too long (Im 5'2) but it sits just right above my knee once on. I will however have it tailored just a bit on the sides so that it accentuates my figure a little better which will cause it to also be just a bit shorter on the length which is what o prefer.... I'll try to upload a pic once I wear it for my bday. Definitely recommend it. The only thing better would be if the dress had pockets lol",1
4,Good coverage and stayed in place,1
5,Love the color!  I ordered a large when I normally wear a medium.  It's fits perfect.,1
5,I love love love this vest!!!  Well made and looks great.  The company has contacted me twice to make sure that I am satisfied...they are eager to get the word out that their products are excellent.  So...WORD OUT!  The Minibee item I ordered is excellent.  :-),1
4,"I was looking for larger towels to replace the ones my toddler has outgrown (nice to bundle her up out of the tub), and the dimensions seemed good, but it's still slightly smaller than would be ideal for a toddler (though bigger than my baby hooded towels). However she adores the panda hood and loves to be bundled in it, so at least there's no need for a toddler power struggle at bathtime! The fabric is very soft and seems like a good quality.",1
1,Completely pointless.  They slip Right off my Warbly  Parker glasses.  Tried tightening  the little plastic loop. No luck.,0
5,"Fit very well, met all my expectations.",1
5,the fit was really nice. I think I will be getting different colors,1
1,Not flattering at all. Sent back,0
5,My son loves it,1
1,The mask was not shaped to a face at all. It was bent wrong in several places.  I couldn't wear itand had to send it back.,0
5,"Adorable. My daughter wears these pretty often. We have many pairs(probably around 15-20 pairs or so), mostly from babylegs dot com, but they all fit the same. I've had them a year, and they haven't faded or been stained and my daughter will still be able to wear them for atleast another year. Over all, impressed by them. Colors are as pictured.",1
3,"I'm a size 12 and was barely able to pull these up. The smocked waist was so long it went from my belly button to past my butt. The drawstring is just a sewn-on piece of string and not functional. The pair I got looked new, but one of the pockets was already falling at a corner. Material is a non-stretch poly blend. It would feel cool for summer, but there are plenty of better options for the same price range.",0
3,Too big for my almost 6 year old.  Fits me though,0
5,Perfect size.  It holds my large iphone and small notepad.  Use it every day.  Nice looking.  Nicely made.,1
5,"Light weight, breathable, comfortable. Worth every Penny.",1
5,Lovely earrings. Beautiful set with matching bracelet.,1
4,Great quality but large than expected,1
5,"Just purchased the Costa from Sole. I have other flips from Sole that I have worn for years, and have given me great service. These are even better. The main difference is the weight (much lighter) and the straps. The straps are soft and comfortable, and minimal to the point you almost don't notice them.  The footbed is supportive and moldable, and great for PF sufferers like me. Sole products were getting hard to find, so I'm very happy to have found these. They will be your new favorites!",1
5,Love this skirt. Colors are good,1
5,This necklace is beautiful! its on the small size but sparkly and great value for the money.,1
5,I can breathe in this mask. What I don't like is the velcro strap that goes behind the head.,1
3,The product had a hole in seam on right side of leg. Fits ok otherwise,0
1,Not feminine at all. They are very masculine,0
2,No wonder its so cheap it tears so easy without me even doing anything thing so don't buy this piece of trash!!!,0
5,Love my dress! Was exactly as described. Fit was great!,1
2,Bought a size small because I'm typically a small and this was awkwardly loose on the arms. Very thin material. Wouldn't recommend.,0
5,That they said it ran larger so i got medium and fits perfectly,1
5,Fun/great material. Big for a woman’s face,1
5,I plan to use this and another color version of this as my twin girls going home outfits in November! Thanks. Amazing infant gown set.,1
1,Seller would not accept return. Look elsewhere.,0
4,I have a small waist and big thighs I normally wear size 12 in jeans and medium in tops I ordered the 3 XL and if it grade it was loose in the top and the arms however my thighs it was fit it there however it serves its purpose it's cute and even though it's thin you do feel the Warmness of the fur so I do recommend just go up two sizes,1
1,Plastic and cheap. Broken pieces abound.,0
5,So pretty ! My chihuahua loves her bling ! Best pick I could get of her !,1
2,It was supposed to be a size for a youth but it isn't. So my grandson can't wear it. Unfortunately we had to go somewhere else so he would have a hoodie before the playoffs,0
3,"Cute (quick option) for last minute needs. However, many things had loose strings I had to cut off & I had to re-glue the hair clips that come with the dress because they were done poorly with “hot glue gun” and were hanging off the metal clips upon opening. The dress was super cute after removing all the loose threads.",0
5,"Well made, pretty necklace, exactly what I wanted, nicer than expected!",1
4,"Solid product, great quality material! They are a bit heavy but it’s not so bad if you don’t mind that. Very trendy and unique. I don’t wear these often, but I do like them for special occasions. Great deal with 2 pairs in the bundle. If you’re a selfie taker, the mirror is a bit distracting, but they hid your eyes so well! And provide great protection from sun.",1
3,"Great band, very pretty! Just way too loose for my wrist even at it’s tightest",0
3,"For the fact that the Measurements are misleading, these glasses do not fit a normal average US Americans Head. I am getting sick of spending money on glasses made for a kids or womens head when it says Mens Sunglasses.  The Frames are perfect size but the lenses are smaller than the frame and is not shown in pic but it is a big difference.  To small for Men good glasses for Woman or childs head.",0
1,WAY too small. Ordered a large and I think they sent a boys XL. Can’t even wear them. Then they replaced with a 2XL I still can’t wear. They must be for small Asia pacific people. I wear a US large (Roundtree and York). 36” waist. 6’. 200lb. Also? They have no swim trunk inner liner (brief). You would have to wear your own.,0
5,Amazing quality for the price. I bought this dress to wear to the KY Derby and was impressed with all of the amazing reviews. The dress hugs your curves exactly where it should! The one issue you may have is I found the top to be fairly large. I am a 38DD and was a little surprised at how much room I had in the bust area of the dress. If you're smaller chested you may have a little trouble filling in the top. Highly recommend and will be purchasing more in different patterns!,1
4,"It worked how I expected but was pretty small, I have a big head though so I’m pretty sure if you have a smaller head then it’ll fit fine",1
3,Sleeves a bit snug but quality is great,0
1,"This dress is paper thin. I wore a very light beige bra under it and you could see the outline of the bra underneath. It ties in an odd way and is very unflattering. I'm 5'3"", 34DD, 150 pounds and this dress looked like a total mess. I wish I hadn't accidently thrown it into my dirty laundry hamper and washed it, otherwise I would have returned it. So disappointed!",0
4,The service was great. The fabric felt wonderful.,1
1,It looks like a 14g.,0
1,Received them in the mail today and both pairs were broken. Not happy with this because this was a Christmas present and now I must go out and buy another 2 gifts. Amanda Wilkins,0
5,"Smaller than what I hoped, but are very cute!",1
2,"The top is definitely blue, and the bottom is black. Does not match.",0
5,Perfect fit and it definitely hid my flaws!,1
5,Got these for my daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves them. They fit perfect. True to size. Very soft and as described.,1
5,Great for the cold weather dodt slide off the kids feet,1
2,Fit is strange... wide in the legs and even shorter than expected,0
5,The items is made with quality material and I Love the fit. Very Comfortable!!,1
5,Matches a different earring set I bought elsewhere.  Love it.,1
3,It’s alright. The price to me is right for the quality you get. The leather is good quality but seamwork is already starting to break in several areas only a month later. I don’t keep my wallet in my back pocket either and since it’s summer time I’m usually wearing shorts so there hasn’t been extreme amounts of pressure on the stitches. I tried using a lighter and scissors to shorten them up but more are starting to appear again. This is only happening in the front I should add. Other than that it’s been a good wallet. I would say it’s what you get for what you pay for.,0
4,"These scarves were nice and large & the quality was good. I just thought they were quite pricey considering that they were plaing, with no embroidery.",1
1,These were just a weird fit did not like at all. I returned them,0
5,"These are really tremendous boots. I was thrilled with the color and condition of the leather which cannot fully be appreciated online. The lining is also very soft to the touch. I hesitated to buy these online because I have a quite generous calf, but these boots fit with plenty of room for skinny jeans.",1
3,A bit large but okay..,0
5,"Sorry, love this!!!  Make sure you get everything out of bag!  I wasn’t sure on how this worked.  Then figured it out.",1
3,"I love the quality of the hat, it is just too s n.v all. More child size, but very nice.",0
5,My cousin has a French Bulldog that she Absolutely Loves. So for her Birthday I went on a French Bulldog Amazon Shopping Spree. I got her this tan colored Frenchie keychain with someother Frenchie gifties. It's Absolutely Adorable. She Loved it. Looks just like her Frenchie Fur baby up to the Black metal collar.,1
5,"Beautiful, it is as every describes.",1
2,"Product is too small of a fit both length and width, which makes it uncomfortable. Not a great material.",0
1,"They're cute, but too much cushion inside.",0
3,"I like it, but the gluing to the headband did not hold, so 1/2 way through the tea I was attending, the fascinator had slid down the headband and was covering my ear.  Not a pretty sight.",0
5,Excellent,1
1,Is a scam is not whatever they advertise. Is a foam cheap mask not what is on picture. Dont buy it!!!!!!!,0
3,"It was a cheap dress for $6.99. It's stretchy hence one size fits all. The lace is pretty as well. I thought the top would be velvet with a lace overlay, but it's not. The skirt is pleated with a lace overlay. When I put it on, it felt like static cling so it'd be best to wear a slip underneath. I've included a photo of the neck. It doesn't quite sit up high like it does in the photo. It looked so pretty in the stock photo, however when I wore it, it appeared really gothic. Material is soft though.  I'm 5'2"" and the lace part came down mid-calf. I'll save it for Halloween or something of the like. I've included photos to show the lace and stretchiness of the material.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please vote yes.",0
5,"I really like this wallet.  It is very compact but still has a lot of places to put your change, bills and ID/Credit cards.  I was initially afraid that it was too small to hold the items I needed to carry with me, but I was impressed with how much it could fit inside.  The color is also quite nice.  So far I am happy with this wallet.",1
1,It broke on the first use. It just fell of my shoulder unhooked from the bag I had attached it to.,0
5,My Niece Liked It A Lot,1
3,I am only given this top three stars because the makers of this top considered a large to be a size 6. How absurd is that? I ordered the size 6 and although it did its job a size 6 is in no way a large and even with that being said the blouse was a size 4 at best. I would not suggest purchasing this stop if you are top-heavy or if you are bigger than a size 8 and tops. Other than that it served his purpose and it was cute enough for my party,0
1,The sides of the band kept falling out.  Poorly made.  Returned.,0
5,Very cute for these warm fall days we are having.  I ordered a M for a loose fit with skinny jeans.,1
1,Don't buy this p.o.s. you could get the fabric at Michaels and make a better product in twenty minutes.,0
5,Everything I needed in one small box,1
1,"Cute idea for the earrings, but by the time they made it to my house, they were bent so badly I couldn't even get them on.  Need to invest in stronger material so these hold up for shipments.",0
4,Very useful and nice quantity.  Just what I wanted and will have enough to last me a while.  Thank you.,1
1,I got this and it was not at all what was advertised.,0
3,"I should have checked the size. Way too small love the earring, but expected something larger.<br />Will return",0
5,"I loved it, it came in the right size 👏🏼🥰",1
2,I wear a size 14/16 and ordered a large.  They were way too small; couldn't even zip the zipper,0
1,Cheaply made and looks like children's glasses,0
5,I got a lot  complement  by wearing it !  It's very comfortable to walk around in the beach area !,1
5,"I love these leggings  I'm 70 yrs old and 5'4 inches tall, 185 pounds  . These leggings fit mid calf for me. Only problem is the black leggings color comes off on my hands/fingernails and discolores them after I wear them for a while.  The fit is fine but i dont like how whatever dye they have used in the making of them comes of on your fingernails.  I have washed them thoroughly quite a few times but this stil happens.",1
5,Thought it might be too big but its not and really very pretty,1
2,Ugh this sucks I ordered these as a gift for someone and they don't fit... then she didn't return them so she gave them back. So I still have them in the box.,0
2,Size was correct but bands on flip flops were stretched out.,0
3,It was a cheap stocking stuuffer. Did its job! Well that's what shd,0
2,Cute accessory but turned 3wks later after purchasing it.,0
2,"Honestly, this was my favorite belt for the roughly ~4 1/2 months I had it. It fit great, looked great, and was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, the belt did break on me at the office this past week, hence the lower rating.",0
4,I love the idea of a zipper pocket for phone and other odds/ends.  The scarf was quite wide which made it quite bulky.  I think with a hoodie or long-sleeved tee it will be okay but probably not to tuck under the collar of a coat.,1
5,I got the yoga socks to use in pilates class. They get the job done. They are so comfortable that I always forget I am wearing them.,1
5,"Oh, my this is so elegant and beautiful. I wore it with an African outfit.",1
2,"beautiful shirt, but size was way too small, was a tight slim fit, size large was more like a medium, we returned and ordered larger size",0
2,"Thin jacket with a small, flimsy zipper. The zipper is on the left which will throw you. Big box stores have better quality puffer coats in the $30 range.",0
1,"Ad says set of 5.  They sent me 1 (one).  I'm awaiting the other 4, but I won't hold my breath.",0
2,Cute but tiny - now string has unravel and coins broken off after less than a month of wear.,0
3,"You get what you paid for:  The chain is very weak and did not survive past the first five hours of wear before snapping at the weight of the large pendant.  The pendant is undamaged, so I tranferred it to a sturdy, sterling silver chain I already owned.  If you are interested in not losing or damaging the pendant, then I strongly suggest that you immediately move it to a higher-quality chain before wearing it.",0
1,These socks are very loose fitting and come off in the bed when you're under the covers. They are also too thin and flimsy. Also they shed little puff balls a lot even after washing a couple of times.,0
3,"My 4 yo daughter was excited about these and loved the design. Every time she tried them on she would walk funny and finally said they were ""tight"". Turns out the plastic band that wraps around the strap between the toes were uncomfortable. After I cut the plastic off, she was walking normally again. She was even running in them. Now she can put them on and take them off herself.",0
5,"Super cute, comfy fabric, elevated t-shirt! Great value for the price! Worn and washed twice, still looks brand new!",1
5,Good buy. Fits nice and comfy,1
1,"Product was not made for product as stated.  Apple Watch does not need a screwdriver to replace band. Don't have a clue what watch this band is made for, if any.",0
3,"I had hoped I'd like these but the crotch is so long, I'd have to wear them under my boobs to fit right. I'm 5'1 and ordered my usual size but these just fit terribly. The elastic waist is tight while the rest of the material is very loose.<br />Not flattering at all!",0
3,These fit rather big on me. I am a size 8 normally and not very busty but I weigh about 150. I ordered a medium based on the reviews I read and they were way too big. Definitely not form fitting on me. The material is also very thin.,0
5,"These are the most fun socks!  The quality is way thicker and cozier than I was expecting, too.  Unique and cute way to celebrate Halloween - it's the little things these days that spark joy!",1
2,This was a nice vest and I really like the material but the nylon zipper won’t stay together. The first time I put it on the zipper ripped from the bottom. Always high a metal zipper is really too bad too because this was a good looking vest but I have no use for a vest that I cannot keep close. I need to send it back for a refund.,0
5,"This is my favorite watch that I've ever owned. I love the sleek design of this watch and pretty much everything about it. The color contrast between the rose gold and gray was something I was questioning at first but when I saw it in person, it's absolutely beautiful. I also love the marbled pattern as well. I think it gives it a different look and feel compared to a lot of watches; the only thing that I've found that could be a potential con is that there are no numbers on it. For people who are familiar with reading time without any numbers, they may find it a little difficult but personally for me, I like the fact that the marbled effect is there and they took out the numbers; it makes the watch seem less &#34;busy.&#34; This is a great statement watch that can be easily dressed up or down. I wear this on a daily basis for work, I've also dinged it against walls and cabinets and it's still holding up extremely well.",1
2,Way to small more for an infant than a 8-year old,0
5,"Loved how the strap was magnetic, can be used on smaller wrists for younger girls. My 10 year old now wants one.",1
4,These are a basic for me and I order a few times a year as I retire old ones that are worn out.,1
3,Good quality!!!,0
3,I returned this product.  The color was very dusty...I was hoping for more pink.,0
5,great quality and they fit well true to size,1
5,"Really soft on the skin, it feels luxurious. A lot better than those you buy from Children’s Place.",1
3,I've had these for over a year (14 months) before a rip appeared in the top of the left shoe (similar to images shown by others). The support has been great otherwise. Just expected them to last longer in this regard. Not sure if I will purchase another pair or look for a similar brand with this kind of support.,0
3,"I was Very hopeful for these earring. I recieved 9 sets of earrings, 2 of which are exactly the same, in style and color.  The backs do NOT fit on the posts, So I will have to get new backs if I want to even wear them. I was not given the colors that were shown, a set that was supposed to be rose gold, is actually yellow gold.",0
3,The tie was okay except that it came with small mold stain on the inside neck section.,0
3,"I sometimes wear an XL and sometimes a XXL. To be safe, I ordered and received a XXL. I does not close in the front and is tight across the shoulders. I let someone who wears a medium try it on and it's only slightly too large. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO SIZE THEIR PRODUCTS CORRECTLY. I'm so sick of Amazon letting them get away with this ridiculous false sizing. They need to put a button that allows us to include or eliminate from searched all slim fit, skinny, and Asian sized clothing. It's such a waste of time.",0
1,It says the tag is M=S US my understanding was that it was supposed to be small by US standards they must be thinking we are giants or something because this shirt is huge I’ll be returning it.,0
1,Was not compatible with iwatch. Returned.,0
1,"This dress was not at all what I expected.  It was way too small - I wear a size 6, got a medium because of the reviews - and I couldn't even zip it up.  The dress came in crumpled and the material was really stiff.",0
1,Not built for the long haul.  I bought this bladder 7 months ago. I purchased it for longer trips where my 2 Liter bladder is to small. In the past 7 months that I have used the bladder maybe 10 times. This month it started leaking where the hose connects with the bladder.  I did not like running out of water halfway into a 15 mile cross country mountain hike. Contacted the vendor and received no response.,0
4,Nice,1
5,Love!  Very light weight and the perfect amount of &#34;cat eye&#34;  This was my first time ordering sunglasses online and they seem to be universally flattering.,1
5,linda!!! Me encanta que se vea tan sencilla y moderna a la vez🥰,1
5,"Great fit, comfortable and nicely dyed colors",1
5,If you remember to take them to the store the square shape is efficient .The bags are well made.,1
1,I was expecting a heart shaped cage and instead got a dolphin one. Also the necklace chain was broken there was no clasp to connect the ends of the necklace.,0
1,Ring arrived broken and covered in nasty powdery fingerprints.,0
5,"I have had this watch for several months now and appreciate its classic looks, durability, and blend with either informal or dress occasions.",1
1,Doesnt fit at all. I got an XL no stretch n didn't go past my butt,0
5,"I really love these panties. They come in a three pack with white, navy and black. They have a contrast waistband in white with a thin black stripe.  The elastic is VERY stretchy and feels nice. They are made of modal fabric, and are so super soft and lightweight.  They have a lot of stretch and because of that you may want to size down.  I received the XXL size  which fits roughly 9-10 size aka womans size 20-22. I think I could have worn the XL because of the stretchiness of the fabric and elastic.  Overall, they are super comfortable and breathable.",1
5,We love this items.  Perfect for after shower,1
5,My grandson loves these pj's,1
5,My boyfriend loves this top too.,1
5,awesome,1
1,"Super small, glasses are for kids",0
3,Not sure what the metal is but my wrist breaks out with itchy rash when I try to use this band.,0
2,I bought three different dresses from this brand had to return all! Dresses look frumpy and unattractive when receiving tried in they were not flattering . Won’t be buying here again. It may work for you but not for me.,0
5,"A very sweet, small but roomy cross-body purse.  Im taking it to Paris.  It will hold a water bottle, an umbrella, my phone, sunglasses, camera, and some money.  I wear a money belt, but this little purse is the right size for touring around and still looking fashionable.  Its very pretty and colorful and adds the right touch to my traveling clothes, which tend to be black with a shirt being the only color.  It has very nice, durable zippers, a strong but attractive lining, not to mention the great art work.  The purse is very well made and durable and I am very pleased with the purchase.  It makes my happy when I carry it.  I will most likely look to buy another.",1
3,Too big for an adult.,0
1,"Terrible quality.  Washed this and also the big brother matching set and the strings on the pants of both of them shredded. Talk about frustrating!  I had to cut the strings off of both pairs of pants, after detangling the string shreds from around every other article of clothing in my washing machine 🤬",0
1,I ordered the oval pink shoelaces and they sent flat pink shoelaces instead. They did come quickly just not the ones I wanted.,0
1,Flimsy trinket,0
1,The filters don’t stay in and it’s too big with the area on the inside made for the filters.  Does not fit right.,0
5,It is not true to size,1
5,I used it when running on a windy cold 30 degree morning and it was great. It kept my face warm but also the air I was breathing in felt warm. After having a terrible dry cough from breathing in cold air the mask really helped.,1
4,I love it. Looks great with black or white. I have received many complements. Good buy for me.,1
5,Runs on the small side. Also very thin. Not what I was looking for. Product returned.,1
5,I have a small wrist and this band doesn’t overwhelm my wrist. It is subtle and simple.  It’s soft and supple.,1
1,"I received it by overseas purchase.<br />I was satisfied until I tried on my glasses, but I soon found a serious problem.<br />If you wear glasses and look at something, you can find that everything looks shaky.<br />I've tested it over and over again, but the situation hasn't changed.<br />I'm afraid we can't use this anymore.<br />I'd like to make the lenses of glasses more carefully.<br />I live abroad so I can't return it.",0
5,I get a lot of compliments on my purse. I've used it all summer and it goes with so many things that I rarely change purses. If I had a complaint (not really a complaint though) it would be that the pockets on either end (not to be confused with the side pockets) are too shallow to really use. I wish they were a little deaper. BUT that should not deter anyone. The other pockets in this purse are sufficient...just like all Vera Bradley purses!,1
5,Granddaughters love them,1
1,Really was excited to wear these...I got a size XL thinking they might be too big because I’m a L but they were too small. Won’t even go up my butt. Very disappointed.,0
5,Love this fit color n quality good buy,1
1,"I was hoping this was a decent gift for my wife, instead her neck turned green...",0
4,It looks good and i like it only because there is a plastic flower like thing in the middle of this locket.,1
3,"I wanted to love this dress as an option for my vacation but it was much too big and thin. I would only feel comfortable wearing this as a swim coverup, but I don’t have a swimsuit in a neutral color to match. I recommend sizing down. I ordered my usual Shein size which is a medium (US=4/6), for reference.",0
4,comfy,1
2,"Very cute but not great quality. Very thin fabric, small calf.",0
1,"Like the thought. But have to return it, it’s not comfortable when you wear it.  Trust me, you got what you paid for.",0
5,Super cute and fits well,1
5,My daughter loves it fits just right she has even wore it to school on pj day,1
5,Does the job I need it to do! Very happy with these headbands. Use them during my boxing classes and keeps the sweat out of my eyes.,1
3,"Made well, good quality!",0
5,This is a great bag. I needed one for work that was a wide width and this bag really matched my needs. It's comfortable to carry with the padded shoulder strap. For the price I think this was a great buy.,1
2,Not great quality.  threading inside began to become undone and defeating the purpose of the wallet.,0
5,Perfect I loved the dress and the company that made it.,1
1,The watch will not stay fastened.,0
5,Very warm,1
3,"I don't really care for it, should have sent it back but I will wash it and see how it does.",0
4,"This doesn’t lay flat on my skin, because I’m new to this I’m not sure if there supposed to or not. Either way cute",1
1,"This item was extremely small, with no opening clasp. ..just a very odd size.  Couldn't even fit over my four year olds head",0
5,I love the color and it fits well. It's a really cute all day apron,1
2,"Bought this in black and white and those colors are great: lightweight, slim fitting, flattering, can be dressed up or worn casually. It’s long enough to be tucked and the ribbing doesn’t pull. Then bought in the pink and it’s a completely different material and a different fit. It’s shorter, thicker and the ribbing is wider. Doesn’t lay nicely. Just not the same shirt. Kept white and black, returned pink.",0
5,Nice Tie!! Perfect,1
5,"This was a gift for my daughter, and she was very pleased with it.",1
2,I was expecting something much thicker. The material becomes sheer when stretched and has the properties of leggings more than a typical neck garter. Doesn't keep elasticity for very long either. 2 stars instead of one only because pattern and color haven't faded or bled out.,0
5,Bought it as a gift for my 3 year old grand daughter.  Her mom loves it and so does she.,1
1,FADED AFTER ONE WASH!!! 😢<br />I was very excited to get this hat. Fits great But after one wash it looks terrible. The black is a dingy grey and the fabric feels like it has been washed a hundred times. I will be sending it back...,0
5,I love the wallet a little bigger then I though but lots of room for my cards and money !,1
3,Too small in the buttocks area for me. I have a curvy body so this did not work,0
5,Very modern design with really good quality and contruction. I use this watch for work and it has worked well in my semi-industrial environment.,1
2,NICE SHIRT BUT DID NOT CARE FOR THE WAY IT FIT.  SENT BACK WITH NO PROBLEM,0
3,It is a pretty ring and it is adjustable to fit any finger. The only thing i don’t like is the side of the ring is very thin.,0
5,"Love the quality and color. Looks like the photo. Thicker, quality cotton. The snaps hold well even when the little one is very active.",1
5,Excellent for keys  and keychain saving cards organization. Holds great. No need to fiddle with o- rings. ❤️👍,1
3,"The stars looks blue to me. Not black. Does not fit like I thought it would but will still keep it. I ordered it on 12/26/2020 and just got it today 1/15/2021. It now on Amazon saying if order now, you will it next day. I do have prime. Dont know why it took so long to get mine. Won't order from them again.",0
5,Worn for about two weeks when it started coming unraveled on the sides. Cute but won't buy again.,1
2,"Way bigger and chunkier, looks likes kid's jewelry. Also very low quality, looks like it was hot glued together. The chain is very cheap too, which is fair because of the price",0
5,"i wear these under my scrubs , and theyre perfect :)",1
5,Super cute! We loved it and was very cute in pictures.,1
5,Wear them all the time,1
1,"Not a screen print.  I had this shipped to the US and was sorely disappointed.  Quality of shirt is decent— it’s a Gildan Softstyle, but the quality of the bang-on vinyl graphic is terrible.  Feels cheap and looks cheap.  Afraid to wash.  How hard is it to screenprint one color on a white shirt?",0
1,This is really small I’m not happy,0
5,Its a good value and a great protein alternative to meat.  It can be made to taste like whatever you want.  A good way to get your trans fat intake down.,1
5,I am in nursing school and we are required to wear face shields or safety glasses to clinical. I bought these because they look like normal glasses and don't make me look silly. I LOVE THEM! They truly look like regular glasses and I am happy with my purchase. They do fog up a bit with a mask on but I am used to this because I wear prescription glasses every day.,1
5,"Works great, plenty of room for binoculars and extras!",1
2,The gloves are really thin and rip very easily with any amount of friction or stretching. Would not buy again.,0
4,buena talla,1
5,Was not fitting for the watch but was able to modify it to fit wonderfully,1
3,I ordered up size and it’s tight in the chest. But okay in the waist. I wish it was a couple inches longer is rather short,0
3,Did not fit as expected,0
5,She wears this on the fishing and dive boat. Very dangerous at the launch ramps if you know what I mean…,1
3,Order a size down,0
3,I love the colors and feel of the fabric. The only downside is that each one is a different size. One of them fits perfectly and the others are small. It’s very odd that they aren’t all consistent.,0
2,"Returning them. Pros: they’re soft, well priced and comfortable. Cons: there’s no compression and feel like there’s no spandex. Result is they’re horribly unflattering and unless you’re super toned, they show every dimple of cellulite.<br />Disappointing because it was a great price for the two pack and they’re very soft.",0
1,Inferior product for the price it is nylon and substandard construction!!  It is like a garbage bag poncho!!,0
1,"I am returning it, because it looks cheap.",0
5,OMG! It feels like a warm hug! It's definitely oversized if you want it to fit you snug order a size down! Great material. It can be dressed up or down!,1
1,just dont buy,0
2,Low quality. Very small,0
5,My daughter really love this last for her masquerade theme prom. Which is also her favorite color. It is a very beautiful mask.,1
1,The color is not the same as depicted.,0
2,Cute but runs wayyyyyyyy too small in the chest/shoulder area.,0
4,I love this top.  I have one in black and one in white.  The design has a nice flowing look to it and is perfect for showing off strappy sports bras.,1
5,On my way to a wedding and is getting compliments already.  I am a size 14 and the xlarge fits just right.  So if you are larger than a 14 get a size up.<br /><br />Update: I love this dress so much and got lots of compliments from my husband that I got this dress also in the black.  Ladies this is a good investment.,1
1,This item runs about two sizes smaller.,0
5,Really cute necklace for my toddler daughter. Delivery took 2 weeks but was packaged very well. Happy with this purchase!,1
1,Not true to size. Fits too small. Returned.,0
5,Love it and it fix perfectly.  Thought that it might not be good for the price but it actually a cute top for the festival.,1
1,I love the design that's why i ordered it. But i am 5' 6 and the length is not flattering to me.,0
5,Love these for my daughter! Stretchy fabric and didn’t irritate her skin..granted my daughter doesn’t have the typical baby chubby thighs.,1
3,Fits somewhat small but very cute.,0
2,Color way off,0
2,Snapped within wearing for two days.,0
5,Simply Beautiful✨,1
3,Lovely style and frame  But small in width  Be sure to measure for a good match,0
1,was never able to get them to work. No instructions included in package,0
3,Feels too rough for silk but kept it anyways. The colors are beautiful.,0
4,Super adorable but gave 4 stars because I can't wear them... Pretty sure the ones I received are a full size bigger than what I ordered. Now debating on whether to stretch up again so I can wear them lol,1
1,Garbage! Came broken & are huge! Cheap horrible product!,0
2,"Pain to install, and did not stick.",0
5,Arrived quickly. It is a little bit smaller/tighter than I imagined for my 7 y/o but is still useable and she likes the designs.,1
3,"The ear cuff itself is a little uncomfortable initially, but once positioned it is great. Cool buy. Great for cosplay",0
1,Washed 1 time... ripped. I needed a nice button up for work. Ordered this. Washed it last night for work this morning only to find a huge rip on the back shoulder seam.,0
1,"At first look at the photo of this product on the model, it looks like a great dupe for the Free People Ruby Shacket - but that could not be more true. It is very sheer and thin (more like a shirt, not a shacket), it does not have a collar, it is not “waffle material” as it says. I wish I had looked through all the photos because the later photos do show the actual product and are much more realistic for what you will be getting. I am disappointed by this product and wish I had just bought the actual FP shacket I wanted rather than this knockoff.",0
4,"These are nice pants. I wear a 4/6 short or petite and I have a 29"" inseam. These hit crop lenght on me which is what I wanted but they are a little tighter in the waistband then in the hips. They are a denim material with a bit of stretch. Not see through at all. I haven't washed them yet.",1
3,"I ordered a large, fit like a small",0
5,"These earrings are pretty, good quality (especially I like the lock)and at the same time, they are modern looking.<br />They could fit with any outfit.<br />Would recommend!",1
3,"Purchased on 12/21 and already 2 pairs have holes. I air dry and wash rarely, but the material is too thin for normal wear and tear. The fit and stay is PERFECT! I just wish it wasn’t so thin and easily worn. At this rate I won’t have any left by February.",0
5,"They are a bit long. I am a 30 length, and man the xl must be a 34. But best pants ever. So comfortable, you will never wear real pants again.",1
1,Such BS when you order something battery powered and it shows up DOA.,0
1,"I didn't like it at all, it doesn't cover anything and it arrived in the wrong colors",0
2,"I bought these pants for two reasons. They looked cute in pictures and the reviews were glowing. I was disappointed in person. I expected to be able to wear them in both professional and casual settings. But they fit like a pair of skintight yoga pants. They definitely can't be worn to work. You might be able to get away with it if worn with a long sweater and boots, but these pants also don't have pockets. That makes them really inconvenient for me.<br />I also didn't like the way they looked on. In the product photos and customer review photos, they look cute and whimsical. But in person, I felt like I just looked really...twee. My sister said I looked like I was playing an elf in a Christmas play. Good thing it doesn't come in green! Maybe I would have liked them more if I could've gotten black, instead of red. But I don't care enough to wait for them to come back in stock. I will be returning these.",0
3,the quality of the shorts is superb. But don't put anything of value in the pockets as they are about an inch deep.,0
1,Looked like it was made for a woman,0
1,"I ordered two sets of this, one for each of my two granddaughters,  for a total of four watch faces. Two of the watch faces had the knob on the side broke off when my daughter tried to help adjust the time. The other two watch faces stopped completely. My son-in-law replaced a battery in one of those and it only worked for another couple of weeks before stopping completely as well. All of this took place within about 6 weeks. This product is fundamentally defective. Don't waste your money.",0
5,Love this jacket!!,1
3,did not fit,0
5,"I like these glasses! Comfortable but sturdy. No slipping or sliding off my face. Not flashy looking but these glasses cut glare, protect my eyes from bugs, and are very reasonably priced. All I needed!",1
3,One size does not fit my normal female head. Two inches too big and not adjustable down. I had to give them to my husband.😟,0
5,"$20!! Should have one in your collection,<br />amazing manufacturing with solid links.",1
5,Nice quality at a reasonable price. Very cute too!,1
5,"It is cute, fits well, and little girl loves it",1
3,cute,0
3,"It's a pretty pin, but smaller than expected.",0
5,I received the 3X in this dress.  I am 5'8&#34; tall with very broad shoulders but narrow hips. I was please that the front of the dress did hang just below my knees. It is a fairly heavy fabric but still a bit see through and gaps at the breasts.  I am ordering a full loose cotton slip that should solve the problem. I may even cut out the short lining so it does not ride up.  It is very pretty and versatile with accessories.,1
3,Collar could have been much larger does not over your whole neck,0
4,Awesome product arrived in time for mothers day,1
2,"The color is a bright red, not even close to maroon.  I was hoping to have a little cleavage showing. I am The body type of the model with D cup boobs The neckline is about 2 fingers below the collarbone. No way to show any  Cleavage. The material is extremely thin. I think I know why the model is covering her stomach where the slit is. That was definitely the worst part. A at costume like a lastic that is too big and gaps is what holds it together.",0
5,Making a difference in how many golf balls my brother recovers.,1
4,Overall it was just what I wanted. I'm not dissatisfied. I just wish it was a little smaller.,1
1,Loved the look of the dress not even close to true to size,0
5,"I absolutely love this skirt! I am 5’9”, 195 pounds and I tend to carry a lot of my weight in my stomach so I was nervous about this purchase. The material is very soft and comfortable, the zipper in the back makes the back form fitting but the waist still has some stretch to it. I would definitely recommend!",1
3,"Its a lot more material than I need. Thank goodness I am only 5'3"". If my legs were longer than 30"" they would be too short!!",0
5,Beautiful necklace,1
1,This review required me giving a star to submit...lol. I am an amazon prime memeber and a mother of two. So i shop online for myself quite often. This shirt is cute online but so cheaply made. I Tried to return and the seller never responded. Amazon denied my refund as well even after disputing the order. I have never had an issue before with returns..<br /><br />Cheap material and is the bottom seam is crooked.. do not buy!,0
3,"A bit thinner that I expected. I wanted something a tad bit heavier. Be sure and wash them before use, they are rough and scratchy. They didn't shrink after washing and drying, so that is a good thing. Probably wouldn't by this brand again.",0
2,Bought this to use for a weekend costume for an escape room. We use our capes every weekend for one of our games. I washed this multiple times. It “molts” everywhere. You’ll have gold lint all over you and it’s just falling apart at all times. I was very disappointed in it.<br /><br />It’s big and thick and looks cool. But you better be prepared to have it shed all over you more than a dog or a cat.,0
3,not a great dress material is not very nice,0
2,I was excited to try this top on.  This top was put in the goodwill bag!  The arms are not comfortable at all,0
2,These slippers are very thick. I was expecting more of a flat slipper. They have too much cushion. They are more like a bedroom slipper than a ballet slipper.,0
1,I returned these. They were see through and not supportive at all,0
5,"I've learned long ago that with Asian sizes you really, really need to go up at least 2 from what you normally wear, 3 if you want a loose fit. I am 5'2&#34;, size 6; having ordered this item (black with grey border) in size 12-14, it looks on me exactly like the picture suggests it should, loose and plenty long enough to be a dress. The scarf/shoulder piece fits exactly the way it does on the model too. Got tons of compliments wearing it as a dress with over-the-knee boots. It also looks awesome with a long grey open front cardigan (I do leave the scarf out for that - the sweater has a simple round (crew?) neckline that works just fine). A good purchase as far as I am concerned.",1
3,"It's great that one gets so many types (and amount) of earring backs. OK, the amount is too much for a person who needs a variety but is not making their own jewelry. Also the little bags the product come in is not resealable. It would of been better if it came in a compartmentalized box or at least resealable bags. Do the backs work? YES, they grip and hold even 14K posts which are thinner than 14Kp or dipped. I wish there was a small set of eight pairs each of the backs for people like me who only need replacements at a reasonable price. We all know that those little &#34;suckers&#34; can get away from us on the best of days. I've been lucky, I have only lost one back and squashed another (two different styles), thus the need for a replacement.",0
5,Was a little tight for a Xl/XXL,1
5,Have worn it many times and love it.  very flexible in chain length and pair with lots of outfits. Love the geometric punky vibe it gives off. On me the necklace sits just below my collar bone so it does sit quite high on the chest.  So far I havent seen any wearing off the the gold which can occur in inexpensive jewelry.,1
5,"This is one of a few tops I bought to get me through the hot flashes of pregnancy in the winter. Plenty of room for the belly bump at 5 months, with tons of room to spare. Long enough for leggings. Lightweight material. The sleeves are gorgeous. Another thing is there is actually a pretty, white, silky liner on the inside because the material is very sheer. That was very nice, and still lightweight. For reference I'm 5'6&#34;, 170 lbs, and 5 months pregnant, with about a D cup now. I also got chocolate rubbed into the sleeve somehow (lol) and it came out when I washed the dishes before I even washed it, so I don't think it will be high maintenance.",1
1,Not true to size chart measure provided.,0
4,"Happy with the purchase, been looking for this item a long time.",1
3,Smaller than expected,0
1,I found the glasses too narrow for me.  My hat size is 6 7/8&#34;.  The description should have some reference as to it's size.,0
2,"The apron is referenced as leather covered by a PU resin. In reality is the thinnest leather you can split, then covered by a thick PU leather layer. They have made all efforts to make something si the tic to be called leather by adding a micrometric layer of hide on the inside.<br /><br />The apron is rigid, and uncomfortable. I really do lot like this purchase",0
5,"Wonderful! My daughter loves them and they look adorable. Excellent quality... they've been dropped, stepped on, and I think one of our dogs even had them for a bit. So, they're durable as well.",1
4,"product came in on time, and was good quality. but was too small for my lip piercing",1
1,Not what I expected coming in. Kinda looked used; didn't look promising to wear and give a lift. Didn't want to waste the time/ money on a bra that MIGHT WORK. Had brought a bra from Target - gave lift and support. Decided to return.,0
3,Cute and comfy I’m normally a large and I ordered a size up like the comments said and I’m glad I did. 3 stars cause it came with a hole in the sleeve.,0
5,"Great product, my 5 year old loved it! Great material (although we have yet to use it in water)...My daughter is loving playing dress up with it!",1
5,Perfect fit true to size comes & with an extender. Ridiculously comfortable. Supports and and stays in place well. It is a very smooth fit and will not cause any bumps to show through clothing. It is machine washable without any problems. I wish they had a D,1
5,"Made this purchase in 2019 and it's now October 2021 and this belt is still going strong. I wear it at least 5 to 6 days a week. It is a well made heavy duty belt and once the ends start to unravel because of wear and tear,  I just cut and burn it and it's just like new all over again. Will definitely purchase again if it ever falls apart completely.",1
2,It’s not a wife beater it’s a nylon material not ribbed like the men’s and that’s what I wanted.,0
5,Prefect variety of sizes,1
1,This item is cute but is very cheaply made. I have bought 2 of these and both have broken effortlessly.,0
1,Muscle shirt? Its a tank top...,0
1,La verdad estoy muy decepcionado por que no es como lo muestran en la foto no es extra small me da grande y se ve que le quitaron la etiqueta,0
3,The pants are like leggings but have no grip to stay up. They constantly ride down and i had to keep pulling them up. Frustrating,0
1,"I ordered 4x larger it fit the only thing wrong with this bra, it looks like you have 1 boob right in the center of your chest. I will try to take apart and separate the cups, looks horrible. I did like the way the sides were wide, but this company probably makes all cups the same with no regard to separation according to side",0
2,"This shirt is not a slim fit and the design is uneven. Very unhappy with the product, but will not go fhru the hassle of returning it.<br />Gave two stars because it arrived on time.",0
1,To small,0
1,This product was not compared to what the model was wearing very disappointed with item.,0
2,"it looks great, but much too small. If you put over the hair, it slides off; if you put under the hair, it slides off, even if I stretched it out to the max length.  May be i should have gotten a men's size?",0
1,"Jewels broke off in less then a week,  was cute...but a disappointment.",0
1,I didn’t like that  I got the wrong shirt,0
2,"Just got it & concerned: bling but will it last ?<br /><br />If, as in the middle word in LifE, IF WE COULD EVER FIND :"" WATCH BANDS"" they would last a lot longer! The "" band"" material gets hard , dried out, UV exposure , body heat  da da da da?<br /><br />WATCH BANDS THAT FIT: FIR SALE: would get viral?<br /><br />I'll be back~~~~ in a little time : wears it every other day out & about, old crummy watch W/ nylon straping & a :"" homemade latch/ closure"" at work, play & dirty? This one for show!🤣😇🇺🇸",0
5,My second purchase in different color. Washes and wears well,1
4,"It might have been just me but when I put on the dress, it looked as if I were wearing a hospital gown, even with the string to tie around the waist. Maybe this dress only suits skinnier women. Fabric doesn't stretch either",1
5,Through no fault of your own the band did not fit this watch. jeweler #1 did not carry any bands but he measured it as a 14mm band I went to jeweler #2 and he told me it was a 17mm watch . I bought a band from him and it turned<br />out to be a 16mm watch. I should mention this all happened because the original metal band had a defective clasp.,1
1,My daughter is 8yrs old and wears size 12. I read they ran small so i ordered size16 and they were too small and a button came off soon as we opened the package. Im returning them,0
4,No case.,1
5,Perfect fit !,1
2,Cups are a little too small and so this turned into a sort of push up minimizer hybrid,0
2,Thin material and is by far not a sweater... Made of cotton lol.. Not worth it.,0
5,"Super cute, just wish the chain were a bit longer",1
5,"I received the magnet band for Christmas and was happy with the quality. I ordered the silver link band for my husband to allow his blaze to look a bit more dressy. Both were great quality! The linked band was hard to figure out for removing links. You pretty much have to disregard the instructions. But once we figured it out, great fit! Very happy with both!",1
2,This is the third set of these socks I've purchased and all of them are soft but fall right off my ankles. I gotta stop buying them.,0
3,Good enough,0
5,Love them!,1
5,Our moms loves these so much! We pinned them on during the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner. They loved feeling just as special as the bride and groom. Get these! You won’t regret it!,1
5,Bought this for a friend.  Has a good sturdy weight.  Made well.  Packaged nicely.  Very pretty.,1
5,It does exactly what it advertises and cooks during hot days. Good for being out in sun for long periods of time. Not exactly fashionable but effective.,1
5,I love that these earrings have screw on backs and the gem is very pretty.  Plus they are 14K gold!  They are perfect for my second piercing in my ears!,1
1,Looks pretty cheap when I received it. Was. Or satisfied at all. Never left the house with it.,0
5,Nice dress just wasn't quite the style I with my figure.  So I returned it,1
5,Ive worm it twice and so far so good.,1
4,"These fit great, its hard to find wides that fit well but these do.  They are a little taller then I expected.",1
3,Very Very Large......gave it away,0
1,"I was super disappointed in this product.  I wanted the black butterfly wings as pictured and instead, I got blue fairy wings (yes...there is a difference and it's in the shape).  When I opened the product, glitter fell all over the place.  More on the floor than on the wings.",0
5,"Product is made very well, fits different sizes of heads",1
1,Leather stuck out negatively. Coins are nice but the leather band was too thick and it didn’t look right.,0
1,Umm so I am 5’4 and 115 lbs. I could not close the robe over my chest which is not large. I had to return.,0
3,Quality was not very good,0
1,Very cheap quality doses not worth 2 dollars,0
3,small,0
5,Very comfortable. Hard to find a top for this.,1
3,Love the color of this scarf and it’s super warm but the fabric sheds worse than my dog! So be prepared and I wouldn’t recommend wearing it with black,0
2,coin purse zipper was broke,0
1,I was so excited when i ordered this bras. But guess what? It is plan useless.. i don't understand all the hype on the ads. I does not work. 1- it Made my perky chest flat. 2- uncomfortable. 3- you can tell through the clothes. I used it for 30 min and it ended it up in the trash.,0
5,Comfortable and a perfect gift!,1
5,I like how well it fits under electronic ear muffs.,1
1,Tarnished,0
3,I did not like the material,0
3,It's just average. It is nothing I would wear.,0
2,Very cheaply made,0
3,"I got these for work and was super excited to get them. First impressions were that I liked the hat it fit nicely, but disappointed by the fact that I would have to sew on the buttons to attach masks and weren’t already. Besides the buttons not being on I like them",0
3,Looks cheap,0
4,My son loves it!,1
3,"They are ok no stretch at all, fits kindve snug",0
3,"It's super small, and you cant fit most stuff, overall it should say a hand bag instead of travel bag",0
3,Much larger than pictured. Still compact but larger than your hand. Pictured with a legal pad for scale. Otherwise works as a nice umbrella. I keep at work in case it rains suddenly.,0
5,"These are the best for the price! I can't wear the cotton ones comfortably. I have a large neck. With these, they are light weight and adjustable. They allow for good air flow and comfort without sacrifice. If I were to complain about anything it would after some time of wearing it leaves an indent across my nose from adjustable string. I do have a large head and neck. For the comfort, I dont mind. I keep one at home, one in my vehicle and one @ work!",1
3,The sideburns are not aligned.,0
5,Thank you for a really nice reminder,1
3,"I think my wife knew this was only an half-shell design when she ordered it but I just reviewed the product description and I don't see that mentioned. It's says, ""replica."" I was surprised; It would have been better to stay true to Moana, the movie, and make this a locket that could hold a ""treasure.""  Amazon's description should be more specific.",0
3,"Returned. Fabric felt nice, but these were much shorter in person that they appear in the pics!",0
1,"Needs some correction on design and how it is cut. However, I like the color.",0
2,"These pants took even longer than the expected delivery date to arrive (which was over a month). They are made of extremely cheap material, buttons, and zippers. When I walk, they're so LOUD. They're like plastic pants, not anything close to faux leather. It literally sounds like it's pouring rain when I walk. They are very uncomfortable - from the material, to the placements and roughness of the details, to sitting down, to the stretch - everything. They are not form fitting AT ALL. They have this hideous sheen to it. I will NOT be wearing this. I am hoping for a refund because I am very unhappy. I waited all this time for this......<br />I HIGHLY recommend NOT to purchase this item. They do not fit, or look, like the photo. You will be VERY disappointed if you disregard this review and end up buying them.",0
3,"Nice belt, didnt realize it was going to be shiny",0
5,"It is SO hard for me to find pants for work that are long enough, yet reasonably priced.  These pants fit so well, I am thrilled!!!  I can't wait until the other colors come back in stock in my size.",1
5,Bought this for my best friend and she loves it,1
2,The chain broke very easily. Not happy with purchase,0
2,"Putting these earrings in were one of the most frustrating 30 minutes of my life. They are SO DIFFICULT to close even when done backward. You really get what you pay for honestly, they're cheap for a reason. On the bright side they sent me 4 pairs instead of 3 sooo that would be great if I were able to use them without wanting to kill myself.",0
1,One of the straps broke when I took it out of the package. Never even got to wear it.  Don't love the material.,0
1,Sent it back for refund.,0
3,Very little directions to take out links and put back together.,0
3,too big but look fine :),0
1,I was looking for a light weight material but that doesn't mean that it needs to be see through. Already gave the shirt to someone who really liked it...but it wasn't for me.,0
1,Whoever came up with the idea to put an actual switch on a belt buckle should get an award for the dumbest idea of this century. I thought this was like the old version until I tried it on and was required to hit a switch to open and get the belt off. You have to hit the switch every time to get the buckle off. Unbelievable!,0
3,"For summer I wear a bunch of thin tops. And I always end up having to put on a bra- no matter how terrible it looks- because my nipples show through. In my search for a solution I came across these neat little things. Ive attached some pictures showing how they arrive and just how big they are relative to my hand. I cant say that Im in love because they honestly show through my tops. I tried on an array of dresses and tops to see what works, and only textured material worked. For thin, skimpy tops you could see the outline of the nipple cover clearly. I simply wish a manufacturer would come out with a sticker-like cover. As far as quality, it seems durable and veryy sticky. The silicone is too bulky. Overall, this is a product that works in certain circumstances. I am a 36 C for reference.",0
3,Pros:<br />great silhouette<br />cost-efficient<br />light-weight<br /><br />Cons:<br />need to order 1-2 sizes up<br />cheap materials<br />should've sewn flap around the bottom so it would close properly.,0
4,Nice dress and sizing is good,1
3,Once of the straps was missing,0
3,"Reall nice for my daughter but the straps are too long.  The front exposes way too much, so she wears a black sports bra with better coverage under it.  If I shorten the straps enought there is no place for her to put it on.<br />She uses it for gymnastics .<br />The legs are great.",0
5,You get what you’re paying for. Used as a joke gift,1
5,These are great gloves! They fit well and work nicely with touch screen too. Sleek fit.,1
4,This is great but runs one size bigger than expected.,1
4,"It's MUCH shorter than expected, more like a sports bra than a shirt, but it is still very high quality, ad VERY comfortable to wear. So I'm not all that dissatisfied!",1
5,Great mask. Breathable and good material.,1
5,Loved it! Perfect fit ❤️,1
1,"I do not like it at all. But for its price I should not expect too high, I do know that. But I do not think I would wear it later, since it looks much bigger and the thick chain too.",0
2,"I love the color and material, but it's way to short to wear as a dress and too long to wear as a long shirt with leggings. The only thing wrong is that its too short otherwise it fits.",0
1,does not lock,0
5,"The nose pieces aren't as comfortable and I am used to but I should be able to adjust them. I recently had cataract surgery and night driving was affected. I now have HALO affects from bright lights. With these glasses, night driving is much, much better. I highly recommend.",1
5,Love the fit,1
5,Ok,1
5,Stylish,1
5,"ToeSox is the best brand to buy, as I have discovered. I recently found shoes with humongous toe boxes and they come with the recommendation of toe socks so I started stocking up. These are the most solidly constructed and the most comfortable, with a band for arch support and another at the ankle. The toes are well-defined so that there is zero excess material or pinching. And they hold up well in the wash (I forget what is recommended as they have no permanent care label, but I've been running them on the hand-wash cycle, cold water, and hanging them to dry).",1
5,Select your true size. It’s not a gas station tee shirt.,1
5,The tail is really fluffy and full and I wasn't expecting it to be as huge!!! That was a wonderful surprise... Worth the price and it came very early... A+++,1
5,I love this!,1
1,"I was pleased with the appearance, the fit, and the apparent quality of the product to it’s price point upon arrival. Placed them back into their box and into the closet to await their time and place for use. The place and time arrived 11 weeks later in mid January. On the second  wearing I noticed the toe form in the right boot might just have something slightly “off”. Third use it definitely wasn’t me but it was the shoe - the toe box form in the right footed boot is not there while it is present and fine in the left boot. This is a a noticeable feeling in the wearing of the shoes as well as easily visible. I’m disappointed Merrill! With online ordering being the blessing and the curse that it is, especially regarding a return or exchange in this instance, I’m stuck. Barefooted and Broke! Bummer :(",0
5,Love it!  Perfect for our little guy!,1
3,"The design of this shirt is very pretty.  However, it does run somewhat small, the material is very thin, and is it is very prone to wrinkling.  Not sure if this shirt will be a long lasting item in my closet.  I'm going to try to extend its life by hand washing and careful treatment.",0
5,Quite . Good for a gift,1
5,It's very beautiful design and good quality!<br />My daughter somedays wears only it,1
3,"The bill on hat will not curve no matter what you do, and I don't like the duck bill look on me, gave it to my nephew",0
3,Not cool,0
3,"The compass does not work, the needle stays in the same place where ever you point it at.",0
3,The item does not have any attachment to the face mask and is loose inside. It also causes my glasses to fog up.,0
1,"Sent for a replacement so might update...<br /><br />Shirt is super cute however, stitching is coming undone and there are extra pieces of fabric stitched into the side. Is definitely a bit tight fitting but not overly tight.",0
5,For perfect. Super cute,1
3,Cut small very tight around the hips,0
5,Fits perfectly,1
3,Do not wear in water.  I rusts very quickly.  I also thought it would have real stones.  But it does not.,0
4,"Good fit, but would prefer a a wireless in this style!",1
3,"Cute style. I will give it that. However, the bottom of this &#34;dress&#34; barely covered my rear end. I am a size 8-10 (and only 5'4&#34;) and bought a large. It fit perfectly everywhere but it is by no means a dress and does not hit mid-thigh like in the picture. I am hoping it will look cute with pants or leggings.",0
5,"Love the length and color... not used to this type of cardigan, but I think I should have sized up",1
3,Leather watch band is very thin and stiff,0
4,It's really cute and fits great got an XL,1
5,Just received this today and I love it! Soft fabric and it’s a flattering fit!,1
1,Cheap shiny super thin material. Don’t waste your time even ordering because you’ll end up returning.,0
2,Really hard to unscrew the top and only wore it a week and the diamond fell out.,0
5,Really affordable and good quality mask. My kids loves it. Super cute and band is just the right size,1
2,"Lenses and frame are WAY too small and narrow for an adult face, they fit nice on my 8 year old nephew, but fortunately he doesn't need them.<br />It's a shame because I had great expectations for these glasses<br /><br />Live and learn",0
5,So glad all black toe socks are available. Washes great and fits as expected.,1
5,Everything allright,1
5,Back to school necessity for my daughter was perfect!,1
3,"This some what fit me.<br /><br />Normally my bras are sized 30B; or XS. The bottom fit pretty well nice and snug but the top was a different story. The cups was firmly molded so for the girls of the itty bitty titty committee it would not work unless you stuff a pillow inside. I also wonder if it would work for women that are larger, would it cut into their skin because it is of a pretty hard/thick material......<br /><br />It's pretty disappointing. But st the same time it's also not for me cause my husband said I looked like I was wearing grandmas swimsuit.....",0
5,Very soft cozy  fabric. Smart looking with jeans.,1
5,"I absolutely love this bag.  The color is a tad deeper than what was in the picture, but that just means when it fades it will still look amazing.  The construction is solid, the stitching on point, and the snaps help to secure what the magnets would have left to be desired.  Its a wonderful bag with tons of room on the inside.  If the Velcro strap on the inside pocket would have been longer it would secure my 17.3&quot; laptop.  A sleeve solves this problem.",1
3,I ordered the darker jacket and received the lighter one. I am normally a small/medium. I got a large per reviews. I probably should of gotten an xl to be able to wear a sweater under it but it will fit a long sleeve shirt fine. Disappointed because I wanted the darker one but the lighter one will do.,0
2,"While the color and stitching is great, it doesn't fit like the picture at all. The sleeves come just past the elbow and the back falls at your lower back. It is much more fitted than what is depicted.",0
2,Super bummed I was looking forward to this dress arriving!  It came and has a color bleach like stain on it!,0
5,I am very pleased with the item. It will make a great gift for my wife this holiday. Also very quick delivery I was shocked to come home and it was here early.,1
5,Very flattering dress. It's a faux wrap dress. Not a wrap. A little thicker material so it hides my wobbly bits. The color is beautiful. I ordered a 2x at first but sent it back for an XL. I don't have a large bust. I usually wear a XL. I'm 5'6&#34; 197 pounds. Chest 45&#34; waist 38&#34; hips 46&#34;,1
5,Great quality,1
3,This mask looks amazing it is super cool and realistic. The only downside is the fact that it is so heavy. This mask is at least 2 pounds and all of the weight goes on your nose. Over all very uncomfortable but looks nice,0
5,Received as advertised. Would order again from this seller.,1
5,Beautiful,1
5,cute blingy,1
5,"I am a designer purse snob when it comes to my choice of purses to use, so when I was looking for a black leather purse, I was given the opportunity to buy this Diophy purse.  Don't let the non-brand name fool you - this purse can stand up with the high end designer purses.  I didn't realize how big this purse was, so I tested to see if my 15 inch laptop would fit in the purse, and to my surprise, it fit perfectly!  The feel of the leather is very soft, and I love the colored interior of the purse - it makes it easier to find what I am looking for.  What shocked me the most is that this Diophy has the metal feet on the bottom of the purse, which is normally found only in the designer brands.  So, if you are in need of a black leather purse for your everyday use, this Diophy is the one for you!  I received this item at a discount in return for my honest, unbiased review.",1
5,These watch bands are great! It fit the gizmo perfectly. The band is the soft silicone and my daughter actually commented on how comfortable it is. Highly recommend it!,1
5,Love!,1
5,Easy to use. Looks nice. Minimal packaging is a plus. Easy to adjust. Comfortable in the short durations I've used it.,1
3,not too bad...I've had better ones,0
3,"Beware! These glasses’ lenses have a yellow-y tint. You can see this tint in person and in photographs, which didn’t do well for my cosplay costume I had intended them for.",0
3,Not a dark brown like the image more of a coffee. 😐,0
2,Two rhinestones were missing from the purse the first time I used it,0
3,Not a big fan of the spandex feel but not bad,0
5,These are beautiful!!! Absolutely the best lederhosen for kids out there,1
1,Not of good quality - super small - threw away,0
5,Nice glasses (1.0 mag); comfortable fit; reduced wear on eyes,1
5,I like the size and they're not heavy.,1
3,A little thicker than expected but very cozy,0
5,PERFECT FOR ALL,1
5,Love them,1
2,I was so excited to get this robe in the mail this weekend. I really want to love the robe but it didn’t come with a belt. It looks amazing but there was no belt!,0
2,Not quite what I expected. The fabric was very shiny and probably looks better on someone much younger,0
5,Love It,1
2,"flimsy material, tight fit. I would buy a size larger.",0
5,Great thank you! i`m happy with this!,1
1,"I ordered 12/14 and loved them, then I sent for 4 more just like I did with previous order and they sent me 16/18 way to big....now they are disputing with me saying it is my fault and they want me to pay postage to the UK....I wore one and before the day was over it was coming apart....The shrugs are not made well...they come apart at the seams. Well the old saying is...&#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; I have learned my lesson.",0
3,"Just received my order...Navy blue with lime green edge highlights.<br />Guess I was expecting a little something more. The material reminds me of wide elastic....minus the stretchy part. A bit rough and it secures with velcro dots. The plastic connectors on mine are kinda cheap and theres glue showing near the edges. Didnt notice it in the picture until now but the Navy blue is not consistent the whole way around either. The band is half Navy blue and half Blueish-gray. Biggest downfall for me is that one of the connectors keeps coming undone from my fitbit. The band has zero stretch, so the slightest pressure on it makes mine come unsnapped from my Fitbit. It cost around $10 but still expected a bit better quality. Will probably send it back due to the faulty connector.",0
3,"Love the material because it feels  good and breathes well. Unfortunately, one pair is already separating at the waistband. Good news is the other pairs are holding up well after a few months wear.",0
5,"This was a gift for a 23 year old male, my daughter's boyfriend, for Christmas. He was hesitant when opening it, knowing it was &#34;some sort of jeweler&#34; that he would feel obligated to wear. When he saw it, he seemed genuinely surprised in a good way, he immediately put it on and was repeatedly praising the quality and beauty of it. I don't regret this purchase, the size was nice, but not too large. I do recommend and would buy again!",1
5,Good quality for the price! Used for a costume (adult) and everything was as expected.,1
5,"I LOVE THIS SKORT!<br />I’ve gained a lot of weight and it’s been harder and harder to find golf bottoms that I feel comfortable in.  This skort is flattering, and comfortable to wear.  The back and the front go down a tad longer than the sides to give some modesty when picking up balls etc.  Plus the inner shorts do not cut off your circulation on your thighs.  I’m a true size 2X and the XXL long fit well with room to breathe.",1
5,"Fits great, love the extra pockets. They do hang low but that is as expected.",1
4,I like it. Very Chic.,1
3,The product is very Danty.  The metal part bends very easily.,0
2,Not the prettiest dress! Runs a little big !,0
3,"The length is perfect and the dress is adorable; however, the upper part is made for a VERY busty woman and the bottom portion of the dress would have fit nicely if I took an additional two inches of the waist.. Not even my DDs fit into the size small, which usually never happens. Unfortunately, I have to return it.",0
3,As described.,0
5,It’s a great piece to add to my collection<br />The Rosegold is beautiful !,1
1,"This was no way a 4X, it was more like a 10-12. My 12 year old can fit it. Not a plus size item at all.",0
3,Runs small,0
4,"Just as picture, but lacks structure. The leather part is rather scuffed, but that might just the the &#34;vintage&#34; aspect. The buttons are not as easy to fasten as I would like. I specifically chose this bag due to the fact that you don't have to undo any actual buckles to open the bag. They are snap buttons. I think magnetized ones would be better, but overall good bag for the price.",1
3,"Lovely colour and design by it was really too big. Also, it's thinner than I expected, not a true knit fabric.",0
3,Strap broke within the first few months of using this bag. Highly disappointed.,0
3,The jacket was very soft. I thought the construction of the jacket was a little off. Basically if there were more of the fur it wouldn’t look so bare in places,0
3,"Ordered an XS, and they fit nicely, maybe a little bit loose compared to other XS leggings I’ve worn in the past. When I put them on, I absolutely loved the way they looked. I got tons of compliments at the gym, but after the first workout in them (and not a particularly intense workout,) they had a run in the worst possible spot, down the middle of my butt near the crotch. I had to leave the gym early, so disappointing. I’ve already ordered them in another color because I liked them so much at first, so I’m hoping this is just a one off.<br /><br />My updated review: the new color I ordered I returned because they were too loose. The seller contacted me and sent another original pair and was very polite and helpful. I’ve worn the new pair one time. These are a little bit loose (still an XS), but not too loose that I won’t wear them. I wore them once to the gym before being quarantined at home, and they held up. Still love the way they look on, very flattering.",0
5,Exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly,1
2,To small even going up a size,0
1,Very cheap unraveled right away,0
3,"The overall quality of the strap is fine...but the hardware is too thick/tall, and the spacing between the hardware sections (second to third metal loop from the buckle) for the watch is too narrow forcing the watch head to be snug up against the third ring in order to place the buckle under the wrist. NATOs are difficult anyway with the extra thickness under the watch itself, but this strap with hardware that is 7mm tall on the wrist makes it really hard to wear. I won't be wearing it. I might simply cut off the extra piece underneath to make it a simpler straight strap and see how it goes.",0
2,Really liked this watch band up until it fell to pieces on me randomly. Couldn’t repair it either. Other than that it was comfortable and looked nice.,0
2,"They look nice, but once you feel them and the plastic glory, it’s all downhill",0
5,Holds up earrings perfectly!,1
2,Too clingy.  Picture shown looks as if it is a cotton t-shirt.  But material is clingy material,0
4,"Material feels soft and stretchy, my daughter wears a 6/7 (6yrs old), ordered the L based on reviews. The length fits her body good but elastic around the inner thighs is very tight and she cant wear it. If I order up a size it will be too big. Will have to see if a seamstress can let it out or expand. Very pretty on though!",1
5,"I'm really impressed. We decided to send our daughter back to school and this is the style my husband wanted, I wanted something with better protection.  When I got it I noticed filters fit in a sleeve over the  filter area, so there is still a barrier.",1
2,I was going to give this a 4 star review because it's gorgeous....then I took a closer look and saw that there were some discoloring (like an old  metal that has deteriorated over the years kind of color) around the center stone (see photo) and because of that this is definitely not worth $34 (I think the style is worth it but the quality isn't)! :( So bummed. I hate the hassle of returning things from Amazon.,0
3,"A bit big, and the stone was loose when it came, but it looks exactly like the picture.",0
3,Two things. First: we received it in a clear package with an address label on it. This might not bother some people but it bothered me. Second: I took it out of the package and there’s button sized stains on the front of it. I’ll be sending it back.,0
1,Very small. I wpuld guess they are made for women size 6 or 7. I could barely get my feet in these.,0
3,It was too big for my son.The material is nice though,0
2,"Ordered a medium and the bottoms fit good but the top didn't fit.  Since I loved the look of it so much I decided to buy a large set (same color set) so I could wear a large top and medium bottoms.  Although it fit perfectly, they were different shades of blue.  Very disappointed.",0
3,"The shirt is supposed to be loose but there’s no structure at all to it. Very boxy. I am 125 pounds, 5’6”, 34DD, house glass shape (but frying pan bottom). I am anywhere between a small and medium for tops (depending on the brand and type of shirt), ordered medium bc of my lady lumps and based on reviews. The material is fine, soft, stitching was fine…..just very “square” in shape…..made me look very frumpy. Maybe small would have been better, but didn't like it enough to go through the whole return and reorder and wait process…first world problems, am I right?!",0
4,I'm able to fit everything I need and keep it organized.,1
1,Very cheaply made. Almost all is plastic. This is something you'd find at a bargain store. Not worth the $ nor the 12 dollars and odd cents we paid!,0
2,Not true to size at all.,0
1,"Beautiful. However, I got two right sided warrings. They arw flat on one side, textured on the other. Holes are tapered, so I couldn't just turn it around. Tried contacting seller and got no reply. The area for earlobe was very small, barely fit me.",0
3,"I wish I relies how big these are. I am pierced low in my septum, wont work. Pretty big for a retainer to be honest.",0
4,"This dress is a chiffon material with lace at the top. The lace looks super good, isn't fraying at all for me. It is super comfy and fit as expected. The only thing is, this dress, like most clothing, looked wayyyy better on the model. It's very loose and flowy, which is nice, but it made me look kind of frumpy. HOWEVER, I put a small belt around the waist and it immediately made it 100x better. Hope this helps!",1
1,The length was too short. Almost like a belly shirt.,0
4,Great to dress up or down. I think it’s probably best on taller people as I feel frumpy With the pleats at the biggest part of me. I’m hoping to wear on vacation after I loose the holiday weight.,1
2,Not happy. It broke on me.,0
1,"They are okay, minimal compression at best..",0
5,Love these earings.  I always get compliments when I wear them,1
5,"Very nice ensemble.Light weight,Great wear",1
5,Perfect size to fit in my purse.,1
1,What guy wants everyone to know he’s wearing a clip-on?? My teen son certainly doesn’t! I purchased bc I bought a black one a week before (but from different company/brand) and it wasn’t at all noticeable. But the silver clip is in the front (see pic) where everyone can see it. Returned immediately.,0
3,"While it fit well, the design began to wear off on the first wear.",0
5,"These are such cute earrings. I wear them often. I can't believe they were so affordable. I have very sensitive ears, and I have not had any reactions to the metal. My hands are a bit uncoordinated in the morning, so they are tricky to get on at first. But once they are on, they stay put! I can sleep in them and they stay right in place. Love them!",1
2,Strange fit..... returned,0
5,Game saver. I had bad cracks and calluses on my thumb and these instantly helped. Plus added bonus your thumb will come out of the ball faster.,1
1,"The material looks ok in person for the most part, however the issue I have is the sizing. I'm normally a size large or xl in clothes and according to their measurements 1x should have been flowy. It came and is super small and fits like a shrug. Don't know if mine was miss labeled or what. AND they make you pay to return it. Do not buy unless you are prepared to eat the cost when it doesn't fit.",0
1,"They are smaller than pictured, came in damaged, the paint feel is unpleasant and unevenly painted.",0
5,Cute headband that is comfortable,1
5,Comodo uno de mis favoritos,1
5,Thank u,1
5,Completely as advertised.,1
5,Love them!!,1
1,This outfit stretched out so quickly that I can't wear it. It was cute but now it is a dress.,0
1,The material is very See-through,0
4,I'll update as I wear it,1
1,Poorly made. Broke over and over. Very cute but only good for someone who doesn't move around much at work. Snagged on things and popped apart.,0
5,"An all around, cute top!",1
2,Had to return this dress. Material is very thin and transparent. You will have to wear something else underneath this dress.,0
5,I loved the design,1
1,Product was as expected,0
3,I'm a 34D and this LARGE top feels more like a 36 B/C. The LARGE bottoms are a tiny bit too tight (I typically wear size 11) .,0
1,cheaply made,0
5,The mask fix great. Love it. I like it you can adjust the string to go around your ear.,1
5,"Carry it with me everyday. Because it's so small, I forget it's in my backpack.",1
1,"Way too small. The picture is definitely meant to be misleading, but i didn't take into account how ridiculously small this was going to be. Reminds me of a quote from the movie Zoolander: ""What is this?!? A center for ants?!?"""" I should have definitely paid attention to the width and length listed. Obviously, I knew it was going to be smaller than the picture, but, come on! Oh, and yeah, significant other hated it. 1 Star.",0
2,Shirts run small,0
5,Love how soft it is. Easy to wash.,1
3,"When received I liked the feel of the material and the color was gorgeous. Unfortunately it runs extremely small so I had to return it. Thankfully Amazon makes returns very easy.  I wear a large/extra large, but couldn't get this on at all. Thought had mistakenly sent a medium, but no.",0
3,I don't know if I will ever wear this other than outside my house.  The bottoms are extremely skimpy and ran fairly small.  The top doesn't fit well either -if your cup size is any larger than a C I wouldn't even bother.  I might fit better in a L or XL of this suit and normally I'm a S/M.,0
5,"After having broken umpteen pairs of sunglasses, I decided to buy these for my husband. I'm really glad that I did! Not only are these glasses sturdy and well made, they look really nice on his big square head. These glasses come in both a drawstring bag and a felt zipper case. The lense (I bought black with crimson lenses) color is subtle. A great pair of glasses that I'm confident will hold up a long time.<br /><br />**I purchased this product at a discount or no cost for an unbiased review.

5,"Works great for my Garmin VivoActive; easy to wear, comfy. I did have to trim it down for my sized wrist but that was easy enough to do.",1
5,Love it. Order about 2 sizes larger than you normally would.,1
3,I ordered the medium because although I am on the smaller side when I am ordering online I've found a little bigger is always better than a little smaller - however they are really big on me. Not to the point where I can't wear them though - they are very comfortable. My biggest complaint is that the black (which is the colour I ordered) runs. It ruined my sheets! I don't know if this is because I have satin sheets or if it's just that the black will run on anything. That's my only complaint though really other than not knowing to order per size.,0
5,"love this clear purse I love the vintage look with the kiss lock frame, very study purse and very big, I'm so happy with this purse, I might buy another one.",1
1,"I read so many good reviews about this dress, I was really expecting to be satisfied with the purchase. man was I wrong! This dress is made of really cheap material. The fabric is so thin you can see through it. The seams were terrible. In overall it looks cheap. The opening in the leg is not stitched in place. It is not worth the money, you can get something better for the price.",0
3,too short. had to return. but i am 5.10 so it will be better for someone a bit shorter,0
1,"Cheaply made, hardware is decent but the leather hide part needs a quality check before selling these items",0
1,"I think this material is like nylon, you cannot breathe through it with even without the filter, it's just pulling air from the sides, horrible design.",0
2,....one of the tags was cut somehow.,0
5,Loved it !,1
1,"Several drawbacks to this mousepad so I am discarding and buying another.  The days of the week are NOT readable because the font is so small.  In addition, the first day on the calendar is Monday and not Sunday making it very easy to use the wrong date when trying to read.  The entire font is truly soo small.  Why have &#34;2016&#34; on top of each month?  Use larger font and do not put the year behind every month.",0
4,Bought these for post baby body and to use to coverup for breastfeeding. I wear them often and like the look of them. They do roll down at the top but that's typical of high waisted leggings.,1
3,"Wore this dress for a pageant. Without the belt it looked huge, but it was okay with it on.  After the second wash it came out covered in lint pills that I can't get off, so I can't wear it anymore.",0
4,I was hoping the lenses were darker. But they are OK.,1
1,Cheap stuff.,0
1,"This looks very cool in the pic. But this is for very, very small ears. It would've fit a child's ear. I thought maybe I was supposed to stretch it out. But when I tried to gently stretch it, it snapped in two. It looks much larger in the pic, with no dimensions in the description. :-(",0
5,My wife loved them.,1
5,Great for the price. Held up for 6months of wear 3 days a week. Padding has worn down so out insoles in but no biggie. These are classy and elegant. They don't expand too big at the calf. They stay slim. I'm a size 0-1 in pants. My calves are not that big. Info have an athletic muscular body.,1
5,its great i absolutely love it its long lasting i still have mine and its in great condition i purchased it about 8 months ago. its really resistant.,1
5,Beautiful and sparkly.  Love this necklace.  Great quality,1
1,These shorts are no good the first time I put them on a button fell off.,0
2,"Wow this was so pretty. I bought it for my mother-in-law for Christmas and thank goodness I took it out of the package to inspect it. The scarf had snags and quite. Few threads coming undone. I returned it and Amazon was accommodating, like always. But really there should be better quality control from the seller. I was extremely disappointed.",0
1,When I ordered this I was expecting green not black and white. This looks like it was cut out of a black marble countertop. Disappointed and such a waste of money!!,0
1,The sizing does not is not correct for American women.  This was really disappointing!,0
2,"Quality was not bad at all, however, the hood does not stay in place or keep its shape as you would expect by looking at the pictures! It falls down and ends up looking a little awkward.",0
5,This necklace and earrings is beautiful. The colors are vibrant.  I gave it as a gift and she loved it!,1
3,Excellent material just too small of a band,0
1,These are too big for preteen boys and slip down easily. They do not hold in place.,0
4,Very sturdy and goes well with everything.,1
1,very thin,0
5,"Great fit, comfortable and quality.",1
5,"An incredibly made sock that explains a slightly higher price. Not only do these socks have a vibrant design that's very detailed, they are also made of quality material. The socks are &#34;heavier&#34;, making them a perfect fit for winter, fall, or those people who's feet are always cold.<br />If you're a sock nut like me, these are a worthy addition to your collection.",1
5,A big hot,1
4,"It will need a camisole underneath, because there's no lining on the bodice at all. I bought a larger size than normal. Overall it's worth the price.",1
1,"The size chart is way off. This is at least 2 sizes too small, maybe more.  And there is no give at all.  It has been returned.",0
5,My moanna! 😍💘☺️,1
3,Good quality shirt just runs small,0
1,I ordered the XL for my husband...his normal size..they arrived and the tag said 5X and they were still too small,0
5,"I like the ring, good width and color. skulls could be a little better in detail but for this price its well worth it.",1
3,"The shirt fit well, but the colour is off and looks nothing like the picture. I typically buy more expensive brands but decided to try this because the image looked so good. The saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; definitely applies here.",0
5,"Just got my shirt in the mail and I'm so pleased, I haven't worn it yet only tried it on and it's super soft. It is a bit see through though. Will update it if opinion changes.",1
1,"My daughter is 10 years old and true to size for 10-12. I ordered 14-16 to be safe, didn't want the hassle of returning. They are tight on her! Small. When you return you have to pay for shipping also. It does not clearly stat that anywhere, so heads up.",0
3,"Just a warning: One Size Fits All in this case pretty much means you can fit all of your family in one belt. These things are absurdly large, but overall the quality is nice. It's a shame that these belts will likely need to be cut and tinkered with before they will actually fit properly - but that's what happens when you order clothing items online!",0
1,Junk! Doesn’t close: it’s like an open bracelet,0
5,Bought two different colors of this dress on a whim because of an ad I saw online. I love them and have gotten a lot of compliments on how they look. Would absolutely buy again.,1
5,These hold very well and useful as advertised.,1
5,Works great Comfortable to wear Easy to clean and can wear it underneath any other shirts,1
5,Love this it's to cute,1
3,"These gloves are advertised as one size fits all, they do not...<br />I am an average sized man and these gloves fit so tight that they almost cut off the circulation in my hands..<br />One size does not fit all.",0
2,Was longer in front then the back size ran small.,0
5,"Perfect length, perfect color, very sturdy and comfortable. The hardware comes in both satin and gloss finish. I have several of these straps and they are the best quality for a very reasonable price. Added new life to my GCS! The green is a perfect shade and made the indices pop.",1
4,Very nice. Lightweight and feminine. They look exactly like the picture.,1
5,"I decided my new suitcase needed a sturdy, distinctive belt...to separate mine from all those other black ones on the conveyor belt, you know.  Very glad I bought this. Quick delivery, and just right!",1
2,Used purse for a wedding. I thought it was a burgundy color. The actual is red so didn’t match my dress. The clasp to close the purse broke! Trying to close the purse and it broke. I didn’t have much inside the purse either and the clasp broke!,0
3,Not for the nose. Way too big,0
5,"Perfect for my backdrop !!  Customers flocked to my booth because they were drawn in by this bright, beautiful butterfly.  Love it!",1
5,One of my favorite pieces.,1
3,Material is very poor. I washed it and it got worse as well!,0
2,"Not the best quality,it broke in less then a week",0
5,"Female with men's size 9 to 9.5 feet - these fit me fine. Sometimes men's socks are too large, but these are not. Of course, these are relatively high on the arch, so they do show in some shoes. But, they are hidden by enough that they are worth it. The backs of these types of socks are sometimes sucked down off the heel - but these stay put.<br /><br />UPDATE - have had these a year now and they still work great. As noted originally, they do show in some things, but I like to wear them in running/walking shoes. I injured my foot and my doctor has me in a pair of workout shoes with special orthotics. These do not show at all; as or more important is that they stay on my foot, are very lightweight (I don't have much room with the orthotic), and so not fall dow on my heel!",1
5,Loved it. Made a great gift.,1
3,"They're a decent fit and do not stretch over time. My only gripe, there is no crotch hole to allow easy access when needing to urinate.",0
3,"Nice shoe, preferred the more covered foot to the open one, but had to return much too narrow for my foot to fit in. Length was OK but the bands at the bottom are not adjustable. Paid $4 return fee.",0
5,Great,1
3,The socks have come in raveled/unsewn at the top seam after the first wash. They fit comfortably on the foot but too tight at the top of the calf.,0
3,"I think the glasses are adorable, they seem to be great quality. The cases and cleaning cloth are very nice. Sadly they are what I would think of as kid sized, but more baby sized.",0
5,These goggles suck - in a good way. The suction power is strong and so far have not let a single droplet of water in after long swimming sessions. The multicolored ones give everything a really cool blue tint too.,1
5,Love them to wear most of the time. They are too heavy to wear all the time.,1
5,es muy comodo y brinda una ayuda extra para evitar accidentes.,1
3,"runs small, the quality is about what you'd expect for a $20 dress",0
5,"Nice, lightweight, longer shirt.  Very comfy. I have one in blue and one in green.",1
5,"Love it!  It is attractive, very comfortable to carry, and it is easy to organize the contents.",1
2,Had to return this. Not as pictured and way too tight for a female.,0
5,Absolutely loved.,1
5,"So much easier for me to breathe, even with a filter in. It feels soft on my skin also and my ears don't hurt. Best purchase I've made since this Pandemic started!",1
5,"Great ratings, beautiful! I already lost one so I might buy them again.",1
1,Too small and see through,0
5,"I usually do not post unless I absolutely love my item purchased and may I say....this bag is beautiful!  It is not as shiny as recently posted in the reviews.  It's a little shiny, but it will lose this after a few months which will makes this bag more attractive than it is.  And if you LOVE the smell of leather as I do....well, it's here with this bag.  I hope not to lose this smell for a long time coming because I adore it.  So well made and worth every penny spent.  Not too large and not to small.  I can even fit baby wipes, diapers, a change of clothes for my kid and my Nikon D 7000 in this bag with no issues.  I am looking forward to many years with this purchase.  You won't be sorry.",1
3,"The ring is nice, but straight out of packaging, it has flaws (see picture I added). Granted, it's an inexpensive item, but stainless steel jewelry should arrive flawless, since it's made by a machine. Quality control let this one slip by and I was the ""lucky"" recipient. Kinda disappointing, because in all other aspects it's a very nice piece. Looks just like rose gold.",0
3,"They run small, They are a little tight but I am in the process of losing weight.  Can't wait to wear them.",0
5,Beautiful top.....and the fit was perfect.,1
5,"These are my second pair , lost the first ones. They are not noise cancelling but perfect for drowning out snoring from my dogs ! I hate the cheap foam ones , they always fall out and I don't like having to squeeze them and waiting for them to fill up in my ears , these you just place in and it's done .",1
5,"Super cute shirt, love the bright colors and the fit.  I’m going to order a couple more because the style is so versatile.  I could easily wear it with jeans, capris pants or a skirt.  The material seems thinner but durable and will be nice and cool for spring or summer evenings (in Midwest).  The colors are also very vibrant and true to the photo.",1
5,cute till someone stole it!,1
1,"Shirt is an odd fit. I ordered a medium and it fits well in the body, but the underarm area is very baggy and attached in a weird spot. The ruffles on the sleeves are nothing like in the picture and the shoulders are so wide I'm swimming in them. There are loose threads hanging everywhere, bow was sewen with different colored threads that were never trimmed off and are just haning out. Bow is not one piece and fell apart. I ended up taking it off thinking it would make the shirt better and it was just worse. Fabric is very thin, cheap fabric. I wasn't expecting high quality because of the low price, but I was expecting something a little better than what I recieved.",0
5,Cute and comfortable. Fits just as I wanted it.,1
4,"The dress fit perfectly, I’m 5’4” and the length was almost to the floor.I  weigh 123 lbs and it was a comfortable fit.I was the grandmother of the groom.",1
5,"Súper divino, tal cual la foto! lo volvería a comprar!",1
5,Very good quality product... extremely easy to swap out. I'm planning on buying more.,1
1, ,0
5,This dress is super cute and looks great on!,1
2,It's very flimsy.  Not made well.  I don't like it but it would cost as much to send it back as it cost.,0
1,Cheap,0
5,"These are so soft but have incredible compression! I love these.  I was skeptical at first, but GREAT leggings. I have purchased pairs from very expensive stores and these fit the same way.",1
5,"Looks exactly as pictured! Great product, perfect for my nieces!",1
1,Wasn't what I expected too small,0
2,Cheaply made,0
3,"it's very cute and inexpensive. cheaply made, but that makes it affordable. good gift for a cat lover. i gave it to an adult friend as a novelty gift but also gave a nice, more expensive jewelry item.",0
5,Perfect fit,1
2,"It's exactly as described, but, when I wore it the paint left red splotches on my wrist. It was hard to wash it off of my wrist.",0
5,Un reloj espectacular,1
5,great,1
4,Soft and cozy material;) Rich color;) It flares out like a maternity top so i suggest ordering a size down and it will be perfect size;),1
3,I like the suit fine.,0
5,I love them so beautiful colors don’t turn and it’s worth the money,1
5,"These are super flattering and very comfortable. I am a predictable medium, however and wish I would have sized down, but I still love these and will wear them.",1
1,way too small,0
1,Too small and the strap broke off on first wear. Would not recommend.,0
5,Ohhhh I love these glasses  Clear and gorgeous when looking forward then nice and clear when I look down at my Phone! So excited I’m gonna but another pair!  Only problem is the ear part is so long but still comfortable,1
3,"The style is very cute and it fit well, however, the spacing on the top was too wide. The two triangle sections felt oddly spaced out and almost in my armpits. I am very small chested (34A), so maybe that’s why. I would imagine someone who is bustier would be revealing a lot of curves up there. For me, I’ll be returning.",0
2,"The bottom half fit my daughter, but he top half didn't fit at all.  We'll have to go out, and buy another top half now.",0
3,Ran small,0
3,"I liked the shape of this hat and the overall style, but I had to return it for a few reasons. The color had a yellow tint to it (looked cream in the photo, arrived more buttercream), which didn't appeal to me or match my clothes. The size was a little large as well. I have an average head size and there are drawstrings to tighten the fit, but the overall dimensions were too large for my small frame (I'm 5'2&#34;); it looked like I had borrowed my father's hat. However I do like the Fedora style with the wide brim for sun protection. I ended up ordering the Victoria instead, in Camel. The color worked better for me, and the proportions of the hat are smaller (even though the website lists the same dimensions). It works much better on a small person, fits my head snugly without tightening the strings (though still blows off in a big gust of wind), and I have received many compliments on it. For reference, I live in Boston and not many people wear hats for sun protection. So if you're worried about looking bizarre, don't be! Go with the Victoria if you have a small frame - you won't regret it.",0
1,For it's price should last longer then 3 months seller keeps lying about under warranty and sending me a replacement that never came. Stay away definitely bad all around.,0
5,I love this necklace.  It's durable and I love how I can change the colors to coordinate with my outfit.  Now essential oils can help with my headaches without putting it directly on my skin.,1
4,They are very comfortable and seem decent but they are not red or dark red. Mine came and there a old lady nail polish dark reddish mauve color. Not as cool as I had hoped.,1
5,It’s comfortable and flattering - a great go to shirt!,1
4,"It's a factory replacement watchband. It fits, was easy to install, and with luck should last as long as the original.",1
5,Purchased for my spouse and she loves them.  She had purchased some winter PJs from the same company and was very impressed by the fit and feel.  She told me that these fit about the same but are cut just a tad bit on the smaller side.,1
3,"This top seems confortable but it doesn't cover much of my stomach. Picture is deceiving. Were not all 16 and want to flaunt it, and seems cheaply made. It it were a brand name I'd sweR it was a knock-off.",0
5,Great fit,1
4,"This dress is lovely. Some revires said it runs a little small so we ordered larger and it was just a little loose in areas but still fit nicely. My daughter is inly 5'1"", so it was more tea length on her , so we had it altered (which for many layers of tule is cutting not sewing.)  It looked fantastic on stage as well. She got so many comments and the DYW organizers loved it.",1
3,I like these sunglasses. However after a while the sleeve that cover arms start to slip off and stick to the ear. It’s a little annoying but otherwise functional sunglasses.,0
1,A lot smaller than it looks and the fabric is not stretchy at all.,0
3,The dress was beautiful but sadly too small. My daughter is a true size 8 and the top was far too small!,0
4,Cheap looking but it does the job.,1
4,"I like the overall look and quality. I really like the quick release function. However, the buckle does not allow you to remove the belt unless you take the loose end out of the clamping part. It is a great belt, especially for the price. It looks and feels like it could tow your car if needed.",1
5,The best. I had a real swalovski one and it is exactly same quality. I am so happy with it. I wish they had clear one with silver color.,1
5,"I love these bands. They are light weight and flexible, and I love the way they fit and look. I think the person that gave a bad review was mistaken. I think he must have ordered his for the Versa or Versa 2, not realizing that these were for the Versa 3 and Sense. I have ordered 5 colors, and will probably order more. I think the holes make these look a little dressier than the plain ones. The red is really a pretty res, not an orange red like so many red bands are.",1
5,"Always a perfect option, casio is the best",1
2,not like the others I bought totally different material and buttons,0
4,Very Nice!!!!!,1
1,This looks cool on with a very earthy feel and such but it came unraveled on me on the first time I wore it to a steam punk ball.,0
4,it's cute! I throw a jean jacket over it with some sneakers and wear to work!,1
5,[[VIDEOID:cf0326929f691d0dd5eb42cfbdf6c35a]] This was most definitely perfect for the winter months. Keeps you warm and the orange is just a beautiful brightness to pull the look together.,1
5,"I really like it so far, it looks real",1
1,"This thing was horrible! The breast part won't stay closed. It's not very good material. Wash it once and it's ruined, by hand too!!",0
1,"awful pants, terrible quality, weird fit... do not buy",0
5,It Perfect To Go With The Ugly Sweater Christmas Party Our Family Is Going To Have,1
1,Cheap unflattering material. Will be returning,0
2,These are made very cheaply and my vision is blurred while wearing them.  I cannot use them for anything. I have purchased better sunglasses at the Dollar Store.,0
5,New favorite sunglasses!! Great value and good sun protection.,1
5,Se ven de muy buena calidad,1
4,Am glad I got a size up!! But I love it!!!,1
5,Fit as expected,1
5,Absolutely adorbs !! Cant wait for nicer weather to get Granddaughters pictures done in it.,1
1,I got a price of material it had not been sewed at all,0
2,Product started out great but I have now had it in for 3 weeks and 3 of the 5 “stones have fallen out”,0
3,"I thought these were cycling shorts, which they can be used for.  Because they are swim shorts, there’s a underwear panel. I’m not crazy about the panty line it shows. As far as comfort, it’s comfortable and I can wear it as shorts. The material is shiny like a bathing suit",0
3,"Beautiful painted leather and good size for carrying wallet, toiletries, and everyday needs. Lining material only problem for me. It's flocked and things catch/ don't slide in or out easily when reaching into the bag. Material also catches lint. I am amending my original review to reflect use over a few months. The lining falls apart and gets lint over anything in your bag. The bag is lovely to look at, but lining doesn't hold up.",0
5,Works great on my tiffanys jewelry,1
1,Dress was so thin and cheap . Didn’t look anything like the pics,0
1,Super thin. Returned,0
4,Love it!,1
2,"Unique, too short in front, sleeves extra long (too long) but bust area and shoulders too small.",0
3,The knit material is very easy to make pulls.  I wore it one day and I already have a couple of pulls on it.,0
5,A Great Buy.,1
5,"I am still in shock after opening this item. Material is great, quality of work is great & it fits perfectly.<br />Highly recommend!",1
2,Blue color much lighter than pictured.,0
5,4 nice looking nato straps for a very good price! Really good!!,1
1,very small  looks like a baby or toddler should wear them,0
5,Wedding,1
5,Love this!! It is exactly as pictured!,1
2,I bought it to wear for my brother’s graduation ceremony but returned it due to ill fit<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice material and pattern<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Breast area was too stretched out when I wore it,0
5,"Product was great!  This order help calm my fears about ordering clothing online.<br />The &#34;stretch&#34; gives a little room for error as well, making them comfortable to sit and stand in for long periods of time, and the quality of the stitching makes it seem like they'll hold up.<br /><br />Company shipped package very quickly, then reached out with an email a few weeks later to follow up (hence this review).<br />&#34;We are the small family company from Tennessee,&#34; they said, and their form letter was sincere in asking for feedback, and wanting to help with any issues.  Customer service is a nice touch that you don't encounter all the time on Amazon, which bumped them from four to five stars.<br /><br />Thanks!",1
5,Love this thick and soft but sturdy sweater. I know it's going to be a staple in my closet for winter. More colors please!,1
1,"Quality of a dollar type store, very disappointed, ordered three only two arrived",0
4,They were a little larger  Then I thought they would be But they work good.,1
4,They tickle,1
5,This is the cutest little thing my little one loves it it's so bright to.,1
2,"Before the COVID-19 crisis, I used to buy 3.5 magnification reading glasses for $1.00 each at a discount store. Worked well and lasted 6-8 months on average. With the COVID-19 crisis, I am shopping on line. These glasses were worse than the 1.00 glasses. Blurry and ill focussed. They now reside in the garbage can.",0
5,"The bag looks more expensive than it was. Though it is the &#34;small&#34; bag, it holds a laptop, paper files, and your usual handbag clutter easily. I just hope the bag holds up.",1
5,5 stars,1
5,Colors are amazing!! Fit perfect!!,1
5,Got lots of compliments,1
3,Not quite! It loses its adjustment in a few days and must be readjusted to my wrist. An annoying characteristic!,0
5,Awesome socks!,1
1,Never got it and never got a refund,0
1,Very cheap material -_-,0
1,"The colors of the bags were not bad and the shipping of the seller was great. However, the bags were very cheaply made. I ended up having to throw away almost half of them. On some of the bags, the seams were torn open or unfinished. On others the ribbons were sewn to the bag or to another section of the ribbon making it impossible to actually pull the draw strings closed. This was extremely disappointing.",0
5,"Great looking watch, unbelievable at this price.  I am tempted to buy another one.  But from what I have read I will keep the complications of the watch to a minimum.",1
4,"It was as expected my mom loves it! I didn't like that it is loose a bit, however it is pretty cool!",1
4,It hugs your beautiful very beautifully,1
1,Useless. Would not stay on,0
5,Wonderful party pack for a fair price. My six year old was over the moon.,1
1,This was beyond HUGE on me. I don't how this could be a small.. I could probably fit 9 people in it with me. So disappointed.  I am a true small sometimes extra small in clothing. This wasn't just baggy it was ENORMOUS. Maybe this is plus sized small?? I don't know.,0
1,This necklace is unsuitable for gift giving because its quality is so very poor.  The metal &#34;collars&#34; separating the beads from the knots are so rough that they snag clothing.  The beads themselves are quite ugly.  Sorry to have to write a review like this.  I returned the beads.,0
2,Runs very small,0
4,Fits as expected. Helps hide the tummy I gained since I ordered it a little lol,1
4,They are sort of like a bathing suit material so if you get a size larger than what you normally wear the colors will stay true and bright. Otherwise the print stretches out and you lose some of the vibrancy.,1
3,"These were very thin. Like the type you buy at the dollar store, exactly. I was thinking they would be a bit more sturdy. They were small too. Wasn't what i was expecting.",0
2,Shoe size fit rather well but the around the calf was very tight.,0
2,Too small. I have ordered nothing but ViV in the past due to their wonderful quality and great designs. I also have a pair of plain grey ones. However for some reason these did not fit the same and were small and too tight. I normally order the Regular one size fits all and I am 5'7&#34; and packing some baby belly fat. I will return for a plus size one size fits all instead I guess. All other designs and colors have fit just fine with room to spare.,0
1,I'll be careful next time,0
4,This jacket is not a mens. It's more of a unisex .not totally a woman's cut but slim and the zipper is on the woman's side.I got this as a gift for my skinny cousin. And he liked it,1
5,Have had it for a while now. No scuffs even though it’s attached to everyday keys.,1
5,"I love the fit of this dress! I'm 5'4, 160lbs with a 36Dbust, so I'm pretty curvy.  This dress always makes me look so slim and hugs in the right places. I ordered the Large and it fits a little loose, but I like that for a more conservative appearance, and the length hits me right below the knees, which I like bc pencil dresses are my go to.  I could probably get away with ordering a Medium as well, but it would be more body-fitted.  I'm ordering the other pattern as well, bc I love this dress so much!  I get complimented on it everytime I wear it! :)",1
1,"Cheap fabric, poorly assembled, and much too small.",0
4,I like the way the dress feels and I like the pockets but they start a bit high on my waist making the waistline look proofed out. But it a jacket this is dress is cute.,1
4,The quality of this shirt is not the best but the style is really cute! It's a great buy for the price.,1
5,Cute just like picture,1
5,Was purchased for my brother's birthday and he likes the goggles.,1
5,Sturdy and good quality rubber boots.  Reflecting tags on the heel and back.  Size 2 seems like they are just a little large for my 7 year old who normally wears size 2 US.,1
5,"Leather under the canvas, so it is comfortable against skin. Nice detail and handsome with tool type watches. Not for dress watches, obviously. Really dresses up the watch compared to the strap it came with. Would work well with Samsung Gear.",1
1,Felt really gross and was crazy itchy.,0
3,It fits perfect nice sterling silver material...only thing the end piece to close it together broke...,0
2,The description for sizing was for men/women size medium.  It should be for men only.  The gloves were much too large.,0
5,Wanted eye protection when playing Pickleball. These are perfect. Lightweight and anti fog while protecting your eyes.,1
3,Buy bigger size than usual.,0
1,The waist band was black but the flowers were dark blue.,0
5,"These are super nice! I’m 5’11” and they are over my knee. Not sure of the fabric content, but it’s part wool. Wish these socks came in brown and black, I would buy more.",1
1,I am a size XL.  I ordered this top in an XL.  It was too small.  I sent it back and ordered a 2X.  Perfect!  NOT.  I wore this ONE TIME and it was a nice fit.  I threw it into the washing machine with my regular dark clothes laundry.  IT CAME OUT LOOKING LIKE A DOLL'S TOP.  I am sending it to Goodwill in hopes that there is a second grade girl that can use it.  Very disappointing.,0
5,Love that it's comfortable.,1
5,"It's unusual looking , inexpensive, accurate, and easy to read. What more could you ask for at this price?",1
5,Love them.,1
5,Love this dress! It fits perfectly and looks great. I’m 5’10” and this dress hits just at my knees.,1
5,Strap is exactly as pictured. Fits my Fender Stratocaster perfectly.,1
5,Fits comfortably love the material that was used to make it. Love how it looks on,1
4,Really Big and beautiful-,1
5,Excellent!,1
2,Toooo big,0
3,Definitely not compression wear.,0
5,"Love these Knit Loungers!  They are like wearing a big T-shirt, cool, comfy, and don't wrinkle.  Easy to wash and wear again!  Wish I had 20!!",1
2,"I am quite disappointed in this band. It is NOT as pictured. The white stands out stark to the silver, giving it a cheap look. It says ceramic, but feels more like plastic. The band has come unsnapped twice and I’ve been wearing it only for a few hours.<br />I will say that the links were super easy to remove, and the band doesn’t feel super flimsy. I just am disappointed in the overall quality and appearance.",0
5,Such a cute hat.  Gotten many compliments on it.  Seems very warm and soft.,1
5,"The necklace is beautiful, but the sentiment of the poem is what made this a wonderful gift to give to a dear friend. She loved it.",1
1,"Will not stay tied, next time I need laces I'll be getting flat laces.",0
4,Great quality and pretty comfy but definitely size up when ordering! I could barely get it off me even though my measurements matched up.,1
5,Adorable dress! ❤️,1
3,"The stones are nice, but the elastic popped within a month of wearing it. The elastic needs to be more durable.",0
3,Not cotton or XXX-Lg,0
1,Material sucks is snags and looks fuzzy the design had potential to be really cute but it's really short and odd shaped I weigh 165 ordered a large and it barely covered by butt,0
4,These are so very fun! I had to return because they were too large and they didn't have a smaller size.,1
3,"Confusing to tie at first, but then comfortable shrinks in the wash...pretty cool for what they are. Again tying them is confusing.",0
1,Made in China,0
5,Very happy! Stays dry!,1
1,"So tight arms, I couldn't wear it. Returned.  So sorry, because it's beautiful.",0
3,"The earrings are much bigger than I anticipated.  However, they seem to be made nicely.  If you don't like heavy earrings, then I wouldn't purchase.  they weigh my earlobes down, which I am not a huge fan of.  But overall, very pretty!",0
5,Yes,1
3,"I like to wear really light-weight running pants in the summer, both for walking around, jogging and especially for yard work in the heat of the day.  I was hoping that these would do the trick, but they have enough ""weight"" to the weave that tend to get heavy and stick to your legs when saturated with sweat.  I much prefer Nike Dri-Fit and certain Under Armour ultra lite running pants, which are lighter than these, do not absorb sweat and are a bit better made, although those fancy brands admittedly cost at least twice as much.  But for the price, this is probably as good as you can hope for in a reasonably light and comfortable pants with zippered pockets.  Certainly, these are better than the cotton junk that some stores sell.",0
5,Love these tanks have already ordered 2 sets and thinking about ordering another set,1
5,Amo estos zapatos,1
5,"Received the order very quickly. Bought these as a gift for my 4 year old nephew so I don't know if there will be any trading when we are at DL. I don't know very much about the Disney pins but for the intended purpose, I think the quality is fine.",1
2,"Beautiful and sparkley, however I bought 3 of these for gifts and all 3 came broken :( 2 were broken at the connections and j had to fix with my own jewelry making items and tools, and 1 the stone had fallen out. Disappointing since it's very pretty :( poorer quality than I was hoping for.",0
5,Great earrings.,1
5,"Love this shirt! Appropriately sheer, and the length is great to cover your bum. Classic fit.",1
1,Washed once and coming apart at the seams.,0
1,Not as advertised. Not a cotton dress but a polyester thick material. Print is pixelated and there are colors missing on the material. A cheap knock off of the real thing.,0
5,Nice skirt,1
1,👍,0
2,Looks really nice for the price but it's a little uncomfortable in the front,0
3,"Beautiful, but the stitching is flimsy.",0
1,Waste of money. Slide on yoga mat and slip down ankle.,0
1,The shape is weird. Not natural at all and makes breast pointy,0
2,"These are children's gloves,  not women's gloves. They are very small.",0
5,"Bought these to take on a cruise, Love them, soft and great length. Ordered two more!",1
1,"Demasiado  pequeño, no salen tallas normales  ,salen muy pequeñas",0
1,it broke when i got it within the first 2 days,0
3,"Did not work to well with silver, with gold it's ok",0
5,LUV...LUV....LUV....PERFECT SHADE OF RED,1
5,Fabulous!  I love it!,1
2,The sole split after only 2 wears :(,0
2,Definitely smaller and tighter than I was hoping for. I thought it would be more of a looser v-neck cut off type but it's more of a scooped neck and hits me right under the armpit. I'm a size 34C and it's pretty tight fitting.,0
3,Didn’t stretch. Return,0
1,"Within a day of wearing them, my ears reacted badly. I don't believe they were 925 sterling silver.",0
5,This is so beautiful! Some of the inside pieces move around. I thought it was going to be ok glues. For the price this is well worth the purchase!,1
5,"These are so nice and soft, my daughter loves them and you can't beat the price! She wants a pair to wear outside lol",1
2,"What I got was probably what I should have expected for the price. The fabric felt like a cheap Halloween costume and the legs would roll up my thighs immediately while the waist was kind of loose. I ordered Medium and I'm 5'7"" 140lbs. I'll be returning and spending a bit more for some shorts I will want to wear.",0
4,It was a present for my husband. Two things I didn't like - the instruction for this thing was on a simple sheet of paper with not very nice typing. And the winder itself was not packed at all!,1
3,"Very comfortable, but not a good fit if you have one foot that leans more to a 8.5<br />Shoe was medium, but fits like a wide, which is great for me.",0
5,The dress is beautiful the color great just a little to short but very flattering,1
1,"I have purchased other t shirts from this brand that I really liked . I wanted to get some different colors . These shirts fit well , but the fabric is too see through.",0
3,"GF writing in. Ladies this is not squat proof at all. Its a cute set, not the most comfortable fabric. I don't know that i would wear this to a gym or on a long walk but maybe for pics or a quick outing.",0
1,"The quality was bad... while they looked pretty, they actually were too cheap and the clasps wouldn't close",0
2,Material is too heavy and I dislike the color...sort of muddy instead of khaki. It's just odd.,0
2,These are wonderful...but only 14 came in the pack. 🤷🏽‍♀️,0
1,"Nice sweater. I quickly tried it on after it arrived, then put it in my closet. Folded and nicely put on the shelf with my other sweaters. I just got it down this evening to try on with pants I bought, and noticed there is a gaping hole in the sleeve. Looks like someone tried to fix it by knotting the threads. Very disappointed I didnt notice it when first purchased or it would have been returned promptly. Lesson learned!",0
5,"Nice basic headbands, not too loose or tight.  Nice to have a bunch in the pack since I go through them pretty fast.",1
5,"For the price you can't beat it! It's not great quality and came very wrinkled, but a wash in the laundry solved that. As I said, the quality isn't great but I don't think anyone would notice. I got a lot of compliments on this dress.",1
4,"I have a pair of vintage-looking menswear style oxfords that came with laces that kept coming undone and caught in my pant legs.<br />I ordered these, and they really do work! They were easy to put in, look neat/tidy and even give the shoe some &#34;stretch&#34; over the top of the foot which gave my particular shoes a much better fit. Plus, you get the bonus of not having to tie the shoes anymore. What a great and simple concept.<br /><br />Note: They may not work on a very small or dainty shoe or athletic shoe (these are a thin dress style).",1
4,This item Came as advertised which is good enough for me!i would buy from this place again without hesitation!good leather quality.Thanks!!,1
5,These fit well and are very comfortable to wear.  They help with the glare of snow and other bright environmental conditions.,1
5,So beautifully made.,1
1,They were way too big for my face and they kept falling off. They also were more black than tortoise shell and since I wanted tortoise shell that was disappointing as well. I returned them,0
5,"I used the dress for a themed party, I loved it!",1
3,Bought for my son for xmas. Delivery was fast. But sweatshirt is super thin.,0
5,"I ordered this for my wife about 5 months ago and it still looks good.  She's only had to lightly polish it with a cotton cloth a few times to bring back the shine. Her only complaint is she wishes the chain was just a tiny bit thicker but it's holding up surprisingly well considering she wears it several times a week for many months now.  She had received many compliments on it too!  I knew when I bought it (As I actually READ the description) that it was going to be dainty and that yes, one side is ""Open"" as this is technically a ""Contemporary"" artistic jewelry piece.  I read one review that stated one side ""fell off"" and I couldn't help but laugh at that.  It is not a very big piece it's about 3/4"" on each corner so it's under an inch in size.  It's perfect for anyone who wants something contemporary, flashy & lightweight.  Not everyone likes ""huge"" pendants!  So if you prefer something more dainty yet beautiful then this will be perfect for you.  If you want something larger then yes, look elsewhere.",1
5,"Love these shirts, Outlaw Threadz has great designs on their shirts.",1
3,"Arrived as expected, the quantity and designs advertised is what I received. They bend really easily and yet somehow dont stay in place on my ear or fall off all together.",0
5,"Bota pelitos del material, pero no está mal. Es cómoda y tiene calidad",1
2,"I had to cut a bigger button hole so the sash would pull through. The ruffles are sewn crooked in places. The waist sags after an hour of wearing because the sash needs to be thicker or there needs to be a button. Luckily, I can sew and work with it… but not worth the money.",0
5,I’m obsessed with these shoes. I bought them half a size bigger and they fit perfectly.,1
5,Nice keepsake. As pictured.,1
4,Comfy and soft but for long legged.,1
2,They were nice but fell apart fast  during first day of use- pulled it out of its bag and a lens popped out- popped it back in but popped out again later that day-  the lens fell and now that lens is scratched-,0
2,Fit is great.  Style is cute.  Color ran and bled into other clothes even after 2 washes and a week in the ocean and pool.,0
5,My girlfriend was happy thanks guys.,1
3,"I would have liked it if it were the right size.... I usually wear a small or medium, and so I ordered a medium. (5'4&#34;, 125lb).  It was WAY too small! An extra large would probably fit good!  Man, if you like muffin top.... get this.",0
3,Beautiful but runs real small in bust,0
5,Nice pants,1
1,"I’ve had this item for 3 1/2 months.  It looks like a solid product but it’s not.  Aesthetics are good, beautiful wood an fabric covered inside.  One of the four winders stopped working.  Getting in touch with someone from Amazon or the manufacturer, Heiden is impossible.  This is the second winder that I bought from the manufacturer, based on this experience I would not buy another.",0
3,"They were good quality,but just too small",0
1,The medium was to small around the waist.,0
5,"Arrived a day early. They were identical to the old ones of 17 years. Good quality, instructions were okay, great price compared to other sources.",1
2,Not as described.. Bottoms were too small and didn't look like the picture.,0
4,"does the job, seems genuine",1
5,Excelente,1
3,I ordered size Youth Medium blue/black for my 10 year old son.  They were HUGE on him.  I decided to go to a local sporting store to try next size down.  Turns out the size Youth Medium sold here is actually an ADULT med.  I may keep it anyway since it fits me well and seems like it will do the job.,0
5,"This is a piece garment.  I really do like it and the colors are bright, sassy style. May order it in the red and black later.",1
5,I bought these as cupcake toppers for a rainbow unicorn party. They were a big hit with both the boys and the girls as they liked that they were rings. They were a good party favor.,1
5,"Great hat,came early.",1
2,The bag doesn't sit well and the handle is on the flapb so it doesn't sit well,0
1,Earrings are nice but too small and gold is too thin it bends too easily,0
5,Great Buy!!,1
5,"This was ok. Fit, price, quality good, its just ok, looks better on the model. Didn't return and I use it, but wouldn't buy another one.",1
3,"Nice style and quality, but runs small.",0
3,Earrings arrived loose in the box and severely tarnished. Can’t wear them. The necklace was in good shape but seeing as how badly the earrings look I’m doubting the quality.,0
4,Good,1
4,"A much better fit than I expected from this all-in-one balaclava mask.<br /><br />It fits my L/XL size head comfortably, with no pressure from the ear loops. It stays in place well and provides a pretty decent level of neck protection. Even on my large noggin, there's a lot of extra material, so their suggested ""other uses"" (bandana, gaiter, etc) all seem plausible.<br /><br />As a balaclava, it's a little hard to breathe through, the material is quite tightly woven. But as a mask, that's a positive-- better filtration.<br /><br />The mask showed no signs or wear or shrinking after a first washing (cold water, line dry). Recommended.",1
4,I wear S but based on reviews got L.  Top fits just fine but the bottoms are still too tiny.  Love the top so I will keep it and donate the bottoms.,1
5,My daughter picked this dress out while she had a cast on her arm. She loves pink and watermelon! It has a bathing suit type of materiel which helps for wet or dry playtime:) We will buy more!,1
5,"Great combination, from casual to formal",1
5,"If you love Big Bang Theory, this shirt is perfect. I use it as a sleeping shirt. Bright color and the graphics are great.",1
1,Nike symbol washed off after one wash!,0
3,Runs very large!  I would size down two sizes at least.  Nice material and color. Comfy!,0
5,Love it,1
5,Holds up great in the wash and keeps it’s shape!,1
3,the collar is nothing like it is in the picture. it just a plain round collar. sad this is why I fell in love with this dress. also the zip goes right to the end there is no area with a small slit at the front. Material and colour satisfactory. But all the things that pulled me to this dress are missing.,0
3,Cross is a nice size although it feels super light.  I wanted to give it 5 stars but I expected a heavier pendant.  The necklace is irrelevant don't buy for the necklace unless it's for a 5 year old lol.  The cross is nice though.  Just wish it was heavier.  I hope it's 14k.  I see it written small on it.  Kinda blurry.,0
5,Perfect bfor the price light is really a dot.,1
5,Beautiful bowl.  It is easy to make sing and the leather striker creates a softer and deeper ringing sound when you stike the bowl.  Great customer service for a great product.,1
1,Cheaply made.  It looks better in the picture.  The top piece kept popping off.,0
1,"The zipper broke when out in it on the first time. I had safety pins to hold me together, thank goodness. I wasn't in the mood to pay to send it back and didn't figure anything would be done tbh.",0
5,My wife loves them and I purchased a matching necklace !,1
5,"So cute on a toddler, used for a photo shoot",1
3,Cute but slightly larger than is comforable =/ but hey it blocks the sun and I look fab,0
1,The socks are very tight and very hard to get on my feet.,0
3,"I am sure they will be fine, slightly inadequate mounting system, but I am desperate for some protection from the sun, and don't want to spend big bucks for prescription SGs.",0
5,"Very nice wallet, for a great price! It's a real shame we have to buy special scanner blocking wallets to protect our ID these days! This wallet is really nice, and has many compartments & nice leather. I definitely recommend!",1
5,My Grandson loves it. I gave it to him for his graduation from college.,1
5,Feel comfortable when wearing,1
4,bigger than expected,1
1,I would be interested in this watch and the various color makeups but that it says &#34;Sparkle Star&#34; on it throws every ounce of would-be masculinity out the door. No thanks.,0
5,My kids favorite pair.,1
2,"I'm pretty disappointed in this top, it seems to be a different fabric than what's shown in their photos.  The fabric is very thin and clingy, it looks like a nightshirt.  I ordered a size up because the size chart made me think it would run a little small but it's huge, so I should have stuck with my usual size.  I would never wear this out of the house, it's very poor quality.  I will sleep in it.  I don't recommend this one.",0
3,"I typically wear between a 4&6, so given the pressure stated is 20-30 mmhg which is pretty tight, I thought I'd go with the medium size. however when I received them they went on like tights, there was no way they were going to provide between 20-30 mmhg compression. since there is no height/weight recommendations in product description I'll share mine- I'm 112lbs and 5'3"". returned",0
5,Love this dress!,1
4,Like the dress it was somewhat small for me.  Definitely go up a size.  Dress was then as well. I returned due to the size.,1
5,"So cute, the material was a little cheap but it was honestly so cute on my daughter and she loved it!",1
4,Gift,1
5,"So far I wear these while working out and casually. I like their feel and the way they fit.<br /><br />It's super important to note that you cannot machine dry these. Washing is okay, but take them out and let them hang dry. Not even kidding if you want these to last. They specify that you can't machine dry them, but I would guess most people don't read things.",1
5,EXCELLENT,1
5,Got this for my nieces and they love it. The stars are bright and can be seen all over their room.,1
2,"I loved the look of this belly ring, but it broke after two weeks.",0
2,"Odd Fit, not worth the price",0
4,I wish they had woman sizes but overall it fit well,1
1,Ordered a Medium for  6'1 150lbs . it's like a XXL. WILL BE RETURNING,0
3,FIT IS GREAT BUT VERY THIN. THE GREY ONE ISNT AS THIN.,0
3,Cute but Small,0
4,"I really like the watch band.  It is being used as a replacement for an Elgin band that is broken.  Looks good, feels good.<br /><br />Why the four stars?  Well, my watch measured out to 20 MM.  The part of the band that the lugs go into to mount on the watch were just a small bit beyond 20 MM.  I had to use my Dremel tool to grind off a very, very small amount.  Less than .25 (one quarter) millimeter.  Once that was done the band mounted on the watch with no problems.<br /><br />The band comes with four spring bars or lugs, and a spring bar tool.  A nice touch which I appreciated.<br /><br />Adjusting the fit is simple, once you realize that you use the spring bar to sort of pop up the clasp, then slide the clasp to where you need it.  No problems there.<br /><br />All in all, a good price for this.",1
5,The length and fit,1
4,I bought these shoes for my granddaughter who is two years old. They appear to be comfortable to her she wore them all day and didn't want to take them off. She was able to put them on by herself and I like that they have a wide sole for stability with nice rubber  bottoms for good traction. I would rate them higher but we've only had them a few days.,1
2,The skirts okay. The top will never be worn by her. It's really short and reeeealllly wide. Fits horrible.,0
5,I have been using these sunglasses for years.  The lenses get scratched over time so I buy a couple of pairs every year.  They work.,1
2,The elastic around the ear loops is very cheap and not what I expected. I am very disappointed. I bought 2 sets and will be returning the unopened one.,0
1,Not recommend,0
1,Looks like a sweater in the picture but is actually a loose jersey knit. Super cheap looking.,0
2,"Very cute, but will not stay up.",0
5,Well built should last,1
4,This was a present.,1
3,"For reference I wear size 10  & 34 C . Size M is super small. Not flattering at all. If you are slim, then it’s right fir you.",0
3,The texture of this jacket isn’t too bad . A bit long but I order Small . I should order XS . I am 5’4” 130 lb but lean . Not bad ! I may order another one but XS,0
5,He loved it,1
3,Doesn’t fit to size,0
5,Best looking Kenneth Cole watch IMO. Got lots of compliments. ZERO issues with the movement.,1
5,Love it,1
1,"Very thin material, I have worn each pair once and they both have a hole in them already.",0
5,love,1
3,"Fabric is very cute but style of the dress isn't my style, bottom of dress is wide/swing and knee length.",0
5,"These key rings are just the right size for my use. I've had problems with small carabiners which open accidentally in my pocket or elsewhere and what is clipped to them gets loose. These seem very secure from accidental opening and are easier to put a key on or take it off than split rings.<br /><br />So far they have served their purpose well, and I will be buying more.",1
4,"I was expecting something more trench coat length (mid-calf or below). I’m 5’8” amd the medium comes about 3” below the knee. The zipper is also a bit cranky. Otherwise, however, it fits fine, and the lining is warm enough.  Being able to detach the hood is also a nice touch.",1
1,cheaply made runs small,0
3,Too baggy should be a slimmer fit.,0
1,"Don't Buy This. Cheap Screen Print. It's Fuschia shiny pink, a bit bubbly, instead of a nice deep red.  DO NOT BUY. Poor quality screen.",0
5,"This product is really cool. Since being required to wear a mask at work, its been irritating that my reading glasses fog up. After applying this product, the fog disappears right away!",1
1,"These broke within the first week of purchase! My daughter hasn’t even worn them outside yet, just playing around the house because she liked them. Horrible. Will not be buying from this seller again.",0
5,"I wear these to weddings, work, dinner dates.  LOVE THESE SHOES!  extremely comfortable. Have worked 8 hour shift in them and not hurt my feet.  True to size.",1
2,Order came missing a bandana for the kids. Package says 4 pack but only 3 came trying to get in contact with the company. Other then that the mask fit well on the kids and they really like them.,0
3,These capris are a little snug despite buying the plus size. I am a size 12/14. I do however like the thickness of them and material.,0
3,Look pretty good but they are really uncomfortable.,0
5,Some stuff I buy off Amazon has funny sizing. This fit great and I love it!,1
5,I used these today and had no issues. I received compliments. I was able to fit two 2-liters in one bag with ease and I didn't get the impression it was going to break. I am not even going to try and get them back in the bag attached.,1
1,Looks cheap,0
1,returned not even true to size.  returned,0
5,This was the perfect piece for a Navy promotional ceremony.,1
5,Super cute bag!!  Perfectly sized for a carry on.  Love it!,1
3,"I liked these shirts overall—quality was good but the fit was very small.  I typically wear a size 6-8 or medium and ordered a large for a roomier fit and it was still very small.  I don’t think xLarge would be much better, as it ran so small in general.",0
1,This is a terrible sweater and it smells very bad upon arrival,0
1,"It says in the description that it fits the iPad Air, but it is about 3 inches too big on each side. It is very high quality and a nice design though.",0
5,Super soft and bright. My son loves it! Super happy with this purchase.,1
3,The back sandal strap broke on the first day I wore these so sadly I'm returning the sandals. They are super cute and fit as expected but they were uncomfortable after a couple of hours.,0
2,"The hat was kind of thin, but at this price, that's what i expected. Unfortunately the way it was packaged, the hat was crushed and creased. I'm nit about to accept wearing a crushed hat that I paid full price! Poor choice to ruin a hat through bad packaging!",0
5,"These are perfect! Although they do come up a bit high up, but that doesn't bother me.",1
5,love it!,1
3,I was expecting it to be a warmer bathrobe. Very light. On the large size. Stick to your size there is added room.,0
5,Best $20 24mm strap you can buy here on Amazon. Love the color and supple feel of this strap. Used this to swap around the bracelet of my Marina Militare and looks great!,1
1,"I am an average size guy. The braclet is nice looking and sturdy, but too small for a man's wrist.",0
2,The mask was very small.,0
1,Rips easily between the knob area,0
3,The earrings were too large for me.,0
5,This chain was a much heavier weight than I thought it would be and I am so glad as I can wear my heavier and larger pendants on it and not have to worry about the chain breaking.  I ordered it because of the unique link design as I haven't  been able to find any chains of this weight or style at any stores that I shop at.,1
5,I normally wear a small but I decided to order a medium because I thought it would fit small. I really like this skirt!!,1
1,You got to be kidding.  I ordered these because it said disposable teaspoons .  These are so SMALL and flimsy I can not even use them.  Not worth sending the back.....,0
1,It was very uncomfortable. The shaft has plastic that sticks out and almost cut my tongue,0
3,"Kids love them, but I don’t know how you would get it to stay up on their face for using as a mask.",0
5,Love this … true to size,1
5,Value for the money,1
1,"Sizing is ridiculous, so small but so wide.",0
1,it does not work for me,0
4,"These are really tight, which I guess is the point.",1
1,Not satisfied with this product at all.,0
5,Nice silk quality!,1
5,"Very thin, just the way I like my ski socks",1
3,"Be forewarned that the little pads on the nose pieces will fall off, maybe sooner rather than later, and you will end up with glasses that will probably never break, but will irritate your nose.",0
3,Very hard to put on the glasses you ware everyday! The polarized glasses do help with the glare during night driving!,0
5,Wow what a nice feel on my legs. Wore just one for awhile to notice difference.  They work but you don't notice it!,1
5,Soft and large!,1
5,The strap is nice and easy for my son to put on and take off by himself. Very soft and the sandal is comfortable. Has lasted longer than we expected.,1
5,"This is a very stylish, well-tailored v-neck T-shirt. I like the colors and styling, the shirt fits as the sizing instructions suggest, and the seams are well-sewn with no gaps or loose threads. The bottom has a sewn rolled hem; there is no drawstring. The 55% cotton / 45% polyester material is finely woven and has the weight of a premium T-shirt. The washing instructions are ""machine wash cold, do not bleach, tumble dry low, iron on low heat"". Due to the dark colors my first wash will be cold, but otherwise I anticipate that the shirt will survive my ""guy laundry"" (permanent press wash warm, permanent press tumble dry warm) with acceptable shrinkage.",1
5,"Bought this for my 12yr old. She is super hard to shop for, 5'6 with a maturing body yet to young for ""Juniors"" Turned out to be AMAZING AND SO PRETTY! Fit perfect, shipped just in time which was fast. I would def recommend and probably will buy again having 6 daughters lol",1
4,Good for the price! I am a small adult woman and bought a youth XL. Fits as expected. The quality is fine.,1
5,Good quality,1
5,"I love this tank! I bought it as a fun addition to a Present Mic summer cosplay and honestly, it's so soft and comfortable that I wear it all the time! I personally prefer a little bit of a looser fit, so this is perfect! Not to tight and just the right amount of flow.<br /><br />If you're looking for a comfortable, punny shirt for sunny weather, this is it!",1
1,"My girlfriend was so excited with this necklace but due to the clasp being defected, the chain cannot stay on her neck .... I was in the process of returning to buy again but now the letter I needed K is out of order and there is no estimated time of restocking. Really disappointed turned out to be a waste of money, now that its useless.",0
5,Lovely quality for a pass down item.,1
3,I love Spunky Soul but this was not a favorite. I like SS because they’re different. This set of earrings looked like others I can buy at Charming Charlie’s. Ok. Just not as trendy looking as I hoped.,0
1,Not too much variety...I was pretty disappointed,0
2,Runs small.,0
5,"I got this as a service gift for the leader of our Mastermind group. Not sure I will give it to her because of the quality.  Seems more geared towards a teenager or child.  The charm itself is ok looking but the chain leaves much to be desired being thin and cheap looking. Box is okay looking but when I opened it, the necklace is packed inside of a plastic bag. Doesn't make the greatest impression. Maybe its the thought that counts.",1
5,excellent quality...not thin material like some I have ordered from other places.  Speedy delivery.,1
1,Shirt was in kids size so if you’re ordering a medium u should be ordering X Large<br />LT,0
1,"Complete and otter piece of crap . It won't even lay flat , it arrived so twisted that I can't even wear it . Very lightweight and cheesy",0
1,Fall out too easily. Feel cheap.,0
5,"I have only had a few purses or bags in the 70 years of my life. But I’ve owned quite a few.  Every 20 years on average I have to search for a new purse/bag.  It must be large enough to carry my iPad now, not bulky, and not difficult to find items,  Plus gives me optional carried methods over the shoulder or as a handbag.  Because of the neutral design it covers all locations, and I do not need to switch bags .  It can service beautifully as a travel bag as well.<br /><br />With a large bag it turns into the “vortex of no return”  stuff goes in ,  but never comes out.  This particular design and bag due to its size and shape has avoided that “vortex”.",1
4,"Love this top, wear a 34c, ordered medium, should’ve sized down. Still works, just loose. Holds up well.",1
5,Awesome quality,1
5,Liked the variety of colors and styles.,1
1,And too small,0
3,"Lovely color. Drapes and moves nicely, The waistband was quite small for the large size.  I had to remove the elastic and replace it with something about two inches longer.  And the jersey is sufficiently thin that any seam, crease or shape of what you wear underneath shows (not as in see-through, but the textures and line shapes are easily detected.) It launders pretty well and air dries on a skirt hanger almost wrinkle free.",0
3,It is a nice watch but from the pictures it looks totally flat but it is not.,0
2,"For the money, I was not supposing I would see such issue...the right pad is much thicker than the left pad...feels comfortable but cannot ignore the difference between my hands...",0
3,Short,0
1,Don't buy  this glasses don't turn dark feel cheap material Im  really disappointed,0
4,"although they are really stylish, they turned my fingers green and are easy to bend and break",1
3,"I have been a runner for 40+ yrs. Just got these shorts and tried them on. They fit comfortably, but they are 3"" longer than your normal 7"" running shorts.",0
5,Better than I expected! Plan on getting more,1
3,Quality is good. Three stars because one of the sleeves had a rogue print on it. Like it had two right sleeves...so there is a random part of a fire engine on the back of the left sleeve. It was fine enough to keep and not hassle returning. But bummed of the quality because it was a birthday gift.,0
5,"Great quality, great price, speeeeedy delivery",1
5,To put on my feet there wasn't a problem with the slippers themselves it was my clumsy foot I couldn't walk in them cuz they don't have any real lip in the back other than that they would have worked fine,1
3,"Beautiful timepiece that goes with nearly anything you want to wear. I bought the 40mm version for my smaller wrist size and it looks great!<br /><br />Apache Pine customer service was great, too, and sent me a new watch almost immediately when my watch band broke (it became separated near the clasp when the (suede?) material tore open, relieving the clasp of its duties.<br /><br />The experience has been as good as it could be with Apache Pine, but I'm just disappointed that they'd craft such a great watch and include a band that breaks within a month of wear. I asked, specifically, if they could send a new watch band by itself. They replied that they could not and would send a whole new watch. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, personally.",0
1,This Shoe Is Way Too Cheap Feeling.,0
3,It arrive when it should have; the least it looks like plastic but will see after I where it for awhile. Leather doesn’t look real are smell like leather.,0
2,It’s cheaply made and poor fitting,0
4,The shirt is perfect. holds its shape and washes nicely,1
2,"Unfortunately, I had the experience that other reviews had where the pattern inside was so pretty and the pattern in the outside way not so much. The seems make it awkward to wear inside out. The fit is good, but the pattern is what drew me to the top the most.",0
1,"I really want to like them, but....quality control needs a little to be desired. One of the grommets on the back pocket of my gray pair was misplaced and ended up falling out, leaving a gaping hole.  Not too happy about that.  If the grommets are placed right, then they have a great fit.  I would change my review if the seller would replace the pants.",0
1,"Hardly glow in the dark, the plastic top cracked and came unscrewed and worn out after like 2 weeks. Didnt get the colors in the image and they are a lot less saturated and neon than they look. i dont use them it was a waste of money",0
1,Very sturdy.<br />I love the length.<br />Then it turns gray and green when you perspire,0
5,Got them as a gift and love them!,1
1,Terrible shirt material is so thin you can see through it looks nothing like picture doesn't deserve any stars it's such a rip off 😡,0
5,Very pretty.,1
3,ok,0
5,Always find uses on the boat. Not just keys,1
2,"It runs a size small if you are ok with the short being leotard-like. Which might be ok, because the skirt is quite full. But size up two or three sizes if you want actual shorts underneath. The fabric is awful, like halloween costume material, and the pattern looks less luxe and classy in person.",0
3,true to size and pretty but very tiny - perfect girl for a little girl.,0
4,"The PJ is beautifully made, definately a good quality. The pants are a different material than the top. I had to return mine because the descriptions stated to order a size down if between sizes due to them running large. I did so but found that not to be the case. I like my PJs comfy not tight. They fitted tight. Also keeping  in mind that the PJ would shrink a little after washing. Unfortunately  they are completely  out of stock or I would have exchanged them.  If I would have ordered my regular size I d be wearing them now. Hopefully they will restock again.",1
3,Very thick socks.,0
4,Nice,1
5,I was worried because I only saw one picture posted in the reviews and didn't know what to expect.  But it was exactly what I wanted.  Ordered a large,1
5,"These hold up very well, fit is a bit small as to sizing chart<br />But I can recomend these with mo problems.",1
2,The top is a crop top nothing like the picture.  The pants fit great.  The material is a sweater super hot not for New Orleans weather.  I had to return.  Im a size woman 16 and bought a 2xl .,0
5,"I bought this for my wife as I liked how it looked online and the price was great, I was skeptical how it would look in reality and when in her hand.<br /><br />I have to dsay it looks just as in the picture, even so BETTER than it looks in the picture.<br /><br />The construction is strong and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />Goes well with :  Red Large Vicky Giraffe Print Faux Leather Satchel Bag Handbag Purse<br />[[ASIN:B001GLGW0O Red Large Vicky Giraffe Print Faux Leather Satchel Bag Handbag Purse]][[ASIN:B00275V4MY X-Large Red Vicky Giraffe Print Faux Leather Satchel Bag Hand Shoulder Bag Animal Purse Square Tote]]",1
5,feels great and fits as expected. I am 6'6'' tall and it is still long enough at arms and waist.<br />No smelling on this trip!^^,1
5,A beautiful work of craftsmanship.,1
5,Fantastic!,1
5,Perfect,1
1,"Returning bag, poor quality!",0
2,Didn't work think battery dead.,0
5,great,1
4,The bracelet is well build and as advertised. I find a bit to bulky from my wrist and the clasp does not allow for an easy adjustment of the size.,1
1,"Firstly, this Halloween themed item was ordered Oct. 1st and slated to be delivered by Oct. 15th. It arrived Nov. 12th. The company has A LOT of excuses and tried to bully me into accepting a 20% discount instead of full refund because, ""our product are in good quality. It's worth to buy, we sure you will like it after you receive it."" The awful customer service aside, the product is not of good quality. I wasn't expecting much from a third party seller from another country, and typically I wouldn't bother, but the item was supposed to come within two weeks of order. The seams are awful and you can see from the pictures they're all over the place. Even one side of the neck line had no bind so the seam is just sitting there waiting to come apart. The description states cotton blend. Cotton blends are 85% cotton, this shirt is 65% polyester. Which also debunks the claim in the description that it's soft. It's not soft. It's not comfortable. The company still tried to charge me even after the item arrived 6 six week after it was ordered and they had already offered to refund it starting on Oct. 21st. I shouldn't have to explain why I don't want to be charged for something that is Halloween themed, was ordered on Oct. 1st, supposed to arrive on Oct. 15th, but didn't show up until Nov. 12th which is 2 weeks after Halloween.",0
1,I ordered adult x-large! Way too small. Would barely fit my five year old Grandaughter!,0
4,Very Happy with it,1
1,gave me  a  rash,0
5,"For the price, it’s very pretty",1
3,Rubber can hurt the back of my heel. What i was looking for tho. Super thin for my slip on converse.,0
1,Poor quality,0
3,"Bought a medium, more like an xxs.",0
3,"Pretty, but small.  Will not fit much more than my wallet.",0
3,I would not recommend this product because it is very cheaply made. You can see the glue on the bottom and it has a very strong smell that’s just terrible luckily the smell faded a little.  It is pretty but the gold is that very yellow color so make sure that is what you want. It is a pretty accessory overall.,0
1,"Baggy, poor quality, and the back is completely see through. Sending it back",0
3,My son wanted these for him and his girlfriend.  Their cute but cheap. Didn’t last long. I think within a couple days the tiny eyes fell off.,0
2,"Honestly, they break easily as you are putting them on. Not very sturdy.  I kept them because they're good just to have a backup.",0
4,Love it,1
5,Outstanding Product...Highly recommend,1
5,Comfortable,1
1,"Unfortunately like other reviews my kitchen has some defects. Overall exactly what I want in a kitchen but the main piece that the sink sits in has a chunk missing out of it and the two pink knobs for the stove were broken. I contacted seller for replacement parts but they are not available disappointed that a toy I just purchased and assembled is damaged with no resolution, buyers beware.",0
5,The Collars are very well fit and no problems at all.<br /><br />*Pink and Black ones were pretty thick<br /><br />*The Purple one is pretty thin so be careful with that one<br /><br />*Has Three buttons that are very well spaced<br /><br />Overall very VERY Nice and came within 2 days!,1
1,Absolute trash. It's printed and not stitched. Looks like crap and I'm actually disgusted. DO NOT BUY,0
1,"the graphic is extremely blurry; it is not as clear as is shown in the seller's picture. you can barely read most of the words, which is really disappointing. it defeats the point of getting a mask that has catch phrases on it if you can't read the catchphrases.",0
5,This item was recieved on time and it's super durable I'm impressed with it and how little it cost.,1
1,5 months in and the coating on one of the lenses have worn off.  There are black blotches on the lenses rendering them useless. I have used nothing but microfiber clothes and lens cleaning solution that is safe on polarized lenses .,0
1,Everything fell apart very cheap,0
1,The item is not as the picture appears. It is difficult to even see what is on the tag.,0
1,This dress is made of fabric that is so thin that you can almost read a book through it. Seriously?,0
1,"I ordered this wallet thinking it was leather. It is only leather on the outside, inside it is &#34;manmade material&#34;. The color was not as expected, it is a lighter blue. But the worst part was that there was &#34;suggested retail&#34; tag inside that was three dollars less than the price I paid on Amazon. Don't be tempted on this one unless none of the above matters to you.",0
5,Great quality!!,1
2,"Cute and cheap, but they kind of look like little girls’ jewelry.",0
3,"It was GORGEOUS ... For the first 5 minutes. I put it on, then one of the krystals fall out. I'm calm. I wear a little longer, and another one falls out. U know what I do? I go ahead a tear the rest of them off.. It doesn't look bad now actually. Its not as pretty as it was but I still get tons of compliments on it so I can't complain too much. It does have a cheap structure though.",0
3,THEY BROKE AFTER THE THIRD TIME I WORE THEN,0
1,"Cute but too big, too puffy for me",0
5,Love this set! The price is great and they are so beautiful in person!,1
5,Great dress that's comfortable and easy to throw on to look nice for outings.,1
4,It's ok I was expecting the material to have been a bit more thicker.,1
4,Very light and simple and fit as expected. I would recomend this if u need a light simple dress for  night out,1
5,It was a beautiful jumpsuit! It just didn’t fit me and you didn’t have it in a larger size. I will keep an eye out for when you get more in stock!,1
3,Sophisticated.,0
3,Not that it’s too small or too large but they just want to ride down your backside. I don’t think my coworkers want to see my rear end playing peek a boo. Otherwise they’re comfortable and the fit may just be because I have kind of flat booty,0
2,I love these headbands and work great for my daughter because she has a bigger head and these are not too tight. My only problem was that the white headband the flower was deformed. It makes me sad since that is the one I probably use the most.,0
1,Hooks are super flimsy,0
4,They will serve the purpose. They were a little lighter weight than I had hoped but that was not a deal breaker. They seem to be well made and I'm sure will be fine.,1
5,Bought this for my daughters theater concert and she looked beautiful!  Def recommend  petticoat for it.,1
1,its ok,0
5,"Great!  Much smaller than the older clunkier model, but still has the great intuitive setup",1
5,If you like trinkets like I do these are a must for The Bone Collector. Accurate replica of a nice six-point shed,1
1,The fabric is very cheap and it’s not stitched evenly.,0
1,Looks as advertised but it has an awful smell I haven't been able to remove. Unwearable.,0
2,Received 100% polyester shorts with zipper. Not anything like what is advertised.,0
5,Perfect,1
1,I ordered this in a size Large - I normally wear a size 8 or 10 - and this skirt does not even begin to go around me!  The only way this is a large is if it is for a toddler!  I was so disappointed!,0
5,This dress is very pretty I was happy when I arrived it is a soft material very comfy to wear. It is a little long but I'm sure a summer 1-2inch sandal heel would do the trick. Easy to move your arms back and forth in.,1
1,"Even with tightest adjustment, still too large for me. Eyewear slips continue",0
1,Broke the first day we had it.,0
1,"I’m 5,8 200 pounds  and I ordered an xl. I normally wear and xl. Too small. If you have big chest forget about ordering this idea. The spilt was way to high. You could almost see my vagina if I didn’t have underwear on. The dress was basically a tunic top. I wouldn’t order again. The material was ok and it had a good stretch to it but the measurements are completely off. This fit like a small!",0
5,I love these things!  Took them on a cruise in Europe and  am sold on using them for any kind of travel.,1
1,Muy pequeña y eso que pedí talla xl y yo soy mediana,0
2,Material is cheap. Not soft,0
3,"I cannot wear any hairstyle with this hat because it is so small, if I leave my hair down, I can *just* get it on my head.  Also - the brim isn't nearly as big as it looks in the picture.  They sent it all wadded up and it still doesn't really look right, the brim is still wonky and the bow probably needs replaced because its permanently wrinkled.  I've never worn it or taken the tag off.  Right now its just sitting in a stack of summer stuff I might use next year.",0
5,The product I purchase for trial and really work in anxiety. It is kind of physical alarm to focus on breathing. I will buy for my parents as well. The necklace and pendent looks nice and attractive as well. It is light weight so you will not feel any heavy load on your neck. I recommend to buy who has anxiety and it will be thoughtful gift.,1
5,Movement and dangle.  Price is good too.  One of my favs,1
1,"I received the goggles I ordered in a timely fashion but was disappointed that the first day my daughter wore them to swim class they broke. The plastic piece of the bridge that connected the left eye goggle snapped (on my child’s face) and I was unable to fit the piece back into its original position. Considering the mostly positive reviews of this product, I’m very disappointed.",0
1,"I’ve worn this for a week, and it’s already broken",0
1,Love the look but I only wore them once and 2 large crystals fell out :( I couldn’t find a way to contact the seller to ask for a replacement or some replacement crystals,0
2,I really loved it wen I received it but when wearing it for a few minutes the chains get tangled right away....,0
3,"It wasn't what I had expected, thought the owls were engraved but they are a picture that is sealed on the necklace.",0
2,"Pretty,but broke after a few adjustments to  the size. After the first adjustment, I knew it would eventually break. I only wore it like twice. :(",0
1,"The paint on these mask was horrible, It was chipped.",0
1,Broken post and cheap material.  Does not look like advertised photos.,0
1,i had to fix the chain to wear the necklace<br />had to use superglue and another tool<br />the chain came broken<br />so i was disappointedd,0
5,I wear it in bath still did not rust.,1
5,Super cute and accurate sizing and color!,1
5,Very flattering. Cool for summer. Looks good with shorts or jeans. Can dress up for work or church.,1
2,Slips off way too much even with the silicon pads on the back. I'm fixing my socks after every 20 steps or walking in a awkward way so they dont slip off.,0
3,too flexible,0
5,Don't sweat into your eyes! Use these!,1
5,Burma calida,1
5,"As much as I love our scuba shop and instructor, I found needed items on-line much cheaper than in the shop.  Good quality and price.",1
1,"The description is false. The entire product is only a foot long to the last hole on the collar. Would even fit a dog, let alone an actual person. My neck is only 14 inches and it's 2 inches too short to even fit. The product is false when it comes to advertising it's useable length. Avoid buying if your someone like me whose neck is bigger than 12 inches!",0
1,Broke after first use,0
5,"I was afraid it would be tight since it looks straight-maybe that my hips or hinny stick out, but the material is stretchy.",1
5,"Last year I bought my nephew a Duke sweatshirt for Christmas that he absolutely loved. So, for Christmas this year I was looking for a stocking cap, since he lost his old one, and I thought since he is still hung up on Duke University that I would try to find him a stocking cap from there. I looked on the Duke University book store website and was unable to find anything that I liked, so I looked on Amazon and I saw this hat and immediately knew that my nephew would love this hat. On Christmas when he opened it, he put it right on his head and wore it for the rest of the day. He has reported to me that he loves the hat and that it is much warmer than it initially seems. Score one for Auntie!!",1
1,The zipper separated from the bag after only using it 3 times,0
5,Perfect fit and so stylish,1
1,Pair DOES NOT MATCH. I’m not happy,0
5,Absolutely love this belt. Easy to use and closes and opens as it should. It's sturdy and even as i lose weight i don't need a new belt this one adjusts easily without making holes and always looks neat!! I won't buy anything else to go with my uniform. I highly recommend this belt.,1
2,"My husband was not happy! The hat arrived in an envelope!! and the cap was flat. So, since it was flattened, it lost its form and does not fit well. You would think it would be in a box, I cant imagine why they would ship it in an envelope with no, fragile or do not crush labels on it.....",0
3,Everyday socks. Fine material not too thick... fine for flats and boots. Good value,0
1,Way too big. The picture does not show how huge they look in your ear - it just wasn't cute.,0
4,"Nice short, nicely cut. But it could be a little smaller.",1
5,haha very useful when used in Hawaii,1
1,"I was really looking forward to getting this hat. However when it arrived it had been rolled and folded to fit into tiny bag. It was misshaped and brim was so creased it could never be reshaped, so hat was all lopsided and unwearable.<br />Certainly not the pretty picture they advertise with. I returned it. Probably will never order a hat again fearing same result.",0
3,This was given as a gift and the recipient was very appreciative.  The problem is only that I bought that product before at a much lower price and have found it on EBay for half the price.,0
5,Beautiful dress,1
1,The wallet does not have enough room for very many cards.  It has no place for cash money.  It is larger than I want and does not fit comfortably into the purse I bought.  And now I cannot even return it.,0
1,This was prettier on model. It fit everywhere but it is tight in bust and upper arms and I always get 1 or 2 x,0
1,The sizing is all wrong. I wear a large. I bought 3 different sizes! Finally I ordered an XXL and it was still too small. The sweater was NOTHING like the picture.,0
3,There for entertainment and make girls seem to enjoy them. The only downfall is there's a few of them broke and when they came in.,0
5,The dress looks great and fits as expected.,1
2,For cosmetic only they don't fit well,0
5,Extremely comfortable and very cute!,1
4,Liked the band. Just didn’t fit the watch,1
5,Super cute on!,1
5,Absolutely gorgeous!,1
5,Love this! It was exactly what I wanted! Soft and fits true to size!,1
3,"The glove itself is fine<br />Hate the velcro strap, tho ... too small<br />Not as good as footjoy or Titleist for the price difference",0
3,Not a nice fit at all /:,0
2,"I am getting tired of Amazon drop shipping everything from third parties while the product details are not fully disclosed. Once received I found the hat is made in Mexico, which is reflected in it's quality: the leather piece is only stitched in the back and the front mesh is off center and looks bad.<br /><br />Frankly I am disappointed that Stentson is putting their name on this. Will be returning.",0
2,Got these for my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter to wear after her ears got pierced. They didn’t work bc they kept coming unscrewed from the back. My daughter tried them and same thing happened to her. They don’t use them any more,0
1,Feels like plastic,0
5,For underneath a jacket on my vest,1
3,"I liked the comfort of the dress, but not that flattering.",0
3,"the charm is bigger than I pictured, but really very pretty and meaningful, I collect moons.",0
2,They were good at first but after a month one of the adjustment clips broke. Also one of the back Clips often came unclipped. I would shop elsewhere these are cheap. I contacted the vendor but never heard back.,0
1,😔 The dress came with a rust colored stain on the back which went through the fabric completely. I tried it on anyway to be sure I wanted an exchange. Nope. Pockets in dress bulges out weirdly. MAYBE would look good on very thin person. Fabric seemed nice besides the stain.,0
1,Cheap looking,0
1,"I'm looking for the box so I can send it back. The first item was, to read the screen means you have to have direct light on the face. Otherwise, the screen is dim. Couldn't see it at night.",0
5,LOVE THESE totally store quality worth the wait,1
5,"I gave this dress 5 stars because it is a great dress for the Halloween lover who wants to flaunt their spooky flair. The material is thin, stretchy, and glossy but I knew what I was signing up for when I bought it. For a cute dress I intend to wear one month out of the year it was worth it.",1
5, ,1
1,too bulky looking. something like this should be chic and light.,0
4,Nice,1
5,"I love this dress. LOVE!!! I paired it with a black face veil fascinator and feather hair clip, and a tutu skirt petticoat for added flare.  The look, once pulled together, did exactly what I wanted it to do; added intentional drama to an equally dramatic occasion.",1
5,"I don’t think I could stress how much I like these glasses. I got them in March 2017 and when I first got them I thought they didn’t look very good but I figured for $10 it wasn’t worth returning them so I kept them. But over time the design and the color of the lenses grew on me. I’ve now had them for over a year and they still look great! I’ve dropped and scratched the glass more then a few times, I’ve even accidentally popped the lense out a few times but I put them back in with no trouble. I think these ones after a year have finally had enough, but I’m thinking I’m going to buy a few more to have on hand! Thanks for reading!",1
2,"Look great at first, but print quickly rubs off and thin plastic covering rips. Also, 90% girlish prints.",0
5,"Haven't worn this out yet but fits great when I tried it on. Thought the ruffles were fuller/more dramatic like the pic but its one layer. However, the dress is still super cute. Love it<br />I'm 5'7, 158lbs and I got the large.",1
2,"I got this shirt for my husband who is 6'3"" and 185 lbs. I ordered and extra large and it is way to baggy!<br /><br />This shirt is advertised as a slim fit shirt and pictured on the model as a tight shirt. However, this shirt is not even close to a slim fitting shirt. My husband is a slim guy and you can blatantly see how wide it is on his arms and across his chest and stomach. Even if the hubby was all ripped like the guy in the picture, it still wouldn't fit. The second model pictured is a slim guy similar to my husband build and it obviously doesn't come close to that picture either. It is also kind of short, so even if we went down a size or 2 it would not fit right.<br /><br />It says that this is a cotton and polyester blend in the product description. However this is a mostly polyester shirt. The pictures of this product make it look almost similar to a thermal or under tank top, almost like a flat black. However it is shinny, like a compression shirt would be.<br /><br />He will most likely just wear it around the house as that material is comfortable. However, for the price of this shirt, I would not purchase it again or have purchased it if I was in person.<br /><br />I took off one star for the description saying slim fit when it is not.<br />I took off another star for the misleading photos of the shirt being tight.<br />I took off another star because the fabric is not described well of pictured accurate.",0
5,Very good quality. Love the design as well!,1
3,Sure not fun to wear all day lol,0
1,"I've been a bit skeptical about these for years but I've always wanted one. I finally ordered and I've been let down, it might just be this specific one, but definitely looking to return.",0
5,Super cute! Easy to put on as well.,1
5,Order  one size up,1
3,"The halo part doesn't stick up very much from the headband.  On me, it sat directly on my head, and it's pretty small in circumference.  To me, it seems more suited for a child.",0

5, ,1
2,Not made of good material. Literally one of the bracelets broke within 2 weeks of having it. Has also started to become tarnished on the lion head. It is a very poorly assembled accessory. Would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.,0
5,"i love these shoes like i do all TOMS, however they are a little tight and will take some breaking in.  I do not recommend ordering a full size bigger because of this.  And these shoes are very narrow. This doesn't bother me but some people it does.",1
3,"Material is thin and shiny. Very pretty pattern, but not the most flattering material. It is also a mistake to order for your hip size. Order this skirt in your waist size, and you will be fine.",0
4,Cute dress!  Does allude to some cleavage which I don't normally like.  Fits nicely with room. I am 5'3 135# and purchased a large. Has pockets!,1
5,"My daughter looked like a princess on her first birthday! 😍 I bought the 18month+ size and it fit like standard 12 month. So pretty! Great value including the tutu, bow and shirt!! I found the gold mocassin shoes and necklace on Amazon too!!!",1
5,They fit good the only thing I didn't like was the moisture collection made to face the look is sweating. But at least one sucking in wet cloth.,1
5,idk if i’m just too skinny but the smallest size was a lil big on me but not too much where i wouldn’t wear them. they’re still super cute and i get compliments when i wear them :-),1
5,I love the soft material and it is very comfortable.  I got a size up from my normal size and wear it as a dress.,1

2,[[VIDEOID:4e11b161fc2fc4bc13a3710fdac9a8a4]] Was deceived in receiving this ring. The skulls are very small and hard to make out and I thought it was going to be a little smaller of a ring. This ring is huge. And really looks nothing like the picture. Not ugly but definitely not what was expected. What do you expect from costume jewelry though?,0
4,"This is an attractive set of opal earrings in a rose gold setting. The backs on these earrings fit very snug and can be a little tricky to get on and off.

1,Looks nothing like the picture. Not worth the price.,0

1,This is a bait and switch dress. Looks nothing like the picture. So cheap. I wouldn't keep the dress even if it was free. Its undescribably bad. This is nothing but a scam,0
4,My little boy loves it.  Pretty warm so he doesn't always sleep in it but he enjoys playing in it,1
5,I work in healthcare and wear a tank top under my scrub top. These work great! Nice and soft! I will order more for sure.,1
3,I bought these for my daughter. She wears a size 9.5. I had to turn these because they run real small. Other than the size they are really cute.,0
1,Not the size they say,0
5,This is a discontinued model and a fantastic buy at this price. Especially for a HAQ (high accuracy quartz) watch. Looks great in person. Leather band is very stiff but breaks in well after a couple days or wear.,1
4,"This is my second pair of these boots.  I ordered these as a backup to my other pair due to the price reduction because they are very comfortable.  My guess is the price cut is due to the fact that the first pair of lugs from the standard laces typically falls off due to the poor way Dunham attached the backing(see a previous review comment).  I don't know why they attached that pair differently from the two top pair of lugs...dumb.  I replaced that pair of lugs with a better designed grommet type(readily available), although the color doesn't match exactly and that works fine.",1
5,Very happy with this shirt.  Fabric feels very nice.  Shirt has a stretchy feel without being tight.  Looks nice on.  The fit is as expected.  Hopefully this will wash well.,1
4,This was a replacement for an identical watch I lost. I don't remember the light working so poorly as this one. Rest of the watch is fine for the price.,1
3,"This sweater is nice and comfy. The only problem is that I have had it a short time (less than 2 months) with not a lot of wear, and the threads are starting to get loose and poke out.",0
5,First-rate sunglasses! I never take them off!,1
1,Not even real hoodie material. I waited a month for this weird polyester hoodie/shirt. I would return it but it doesn’t even seem worth the hassle.,0
5,Fit is true to size I could have gone with a medium as I am a size 8-10 but i dont like things tight around the bust.,1
5,"Warm, comfortable, looks great. Nice color, good price.",1
2,I needed an apron that was good for grilling. This one is highly flammable,0
1,After one wash the seam on the arm is already coming apart.,0
5,The colors in person are just as they showed on my screen - vibrant and really pretty!  The hints of blue/green amidst the brown is exactly what I was looking for and I'm very happy with this purchase.  I only wish they had matching or coordinating earrings.,1
3,Some of the latches don't open,0
5,"Love the jacket, it fit perfect on my size",1
5,Super cool glasses.,1
4,"I purchased this bracelet for mother. It's beautiful, she absolutely loved it and after seeing it, I loved it as well! She wears it all the time and never takes it off. My only issue is, this is the 3rd time I am purchasing the bracelet...the previous bracelets broke and she had beads all over the place. The last one I purchased was 6 months ago...not sure why this is happening. She is not doing anything to cause it to fall apart. She takes very good care of her things. It would be nice to receive a replacement instead of purchasing again.",1
5,Is a perfect touch to our beautiful home and is a testament to the beauty of these dogs.!,1
5,"High quality fantastic Very good, fast delivery and delivery on time Thank you very much<br />See you in next shopping",1
5,"Nice, fits as expected",1
5,"Really cute, fun fabric, seems quite well-constructed, roomy enough for all of my toiletries.",1
5,Works great without leaving any trace of it on your glasses.  Even works in the cold.,1
1,WAY too small...Seriously.  My wife wears an XL in just about everything.  This left a 10 gap in the front.  The XL is NOT an XL.,0
5,Love em,1
5,"Very nice wallet!! A bit stiff at first but loosens up after awhile, good size with ample room for cards",1
4,"Fits well. Comfy material. Sleeves extend out past my hands though. Not sure if its supposed to be that way, but I like it.",1
1,Too big for any teeth,0
4,"The dress is a great length for a teacher (I’m 5’1 and it went a tad past my knees at the longest point). It fits well in the shoulders and waist, but I just wish the fabric was a bit softer! I think it will be a “hang dry only,” dress. Overall I’m pretty satisfied for the price!",1
5,comfortable and very much appreciared!,1
2,After 2 wash the shirt shrink atleast one size.,0
4,Velcro comes off easily if you the type person to brush your wrist against your clothes or other objects. But other than that super comfortable!,1
5,"Very comfortable and cute, and the matching panties are cheeky and cute as well",1
1,material issue,0
1,Not sure how anyone's skin can handle cheap material like this. It irritated my piercing so badly. Took days without one in to recover. Cute but metal needs major upgrading. Not worth it.,0
4,Product is a little sheer but still cute.. 5’8 100 pounds small fit great. Just a warning that this fabric can really cling to you,1
1,"After just a few days, this broke.  Would love to return, but past return date.  Looks beautiful, hate that it broke.",0
1,Terrible. The dress arrived with a bunch of white stuff all over the front of it. Not happy with this purchase,0
3,The fit is narrow yet big,0
5,Ortho feet is comfortable and fits exceptionally well.  Simply put.  My husband says its the best shoue brand he ever tried and hes tried them all,1
2,Broke the second time wearing them,0
5,Very nice hat an scarf I love it .I bought two of them for my grandsons.. unfortunately I only received one..,1
4,They do what they need too and are cheap.,1
5,"Awesome watch.  Always wanted a G-SHOCK, but never got one…ever.  Needed a watch to surf/sup.  It can crazy in the impact zone so was looking for a waterproof and bomb proof watch.  Went with this classic G-SHOCK after remembering also wanting one when I was young.  This model is tricked out with Solar power and Bluetooth in the classic look.  Added some bull bars for that even more classic look.  Ohh this watch is amazing in the surf.",1
5,Most comfortable sock I own,1
5,This bag is amazing. The color is beautiful. Handbag has a lot of room and great size. This leather is genuine and very smooth. The bag has feet on the  bottom to protect the bag.,1
2,the stitching on the sides are for Narrow people.,0
3,"Earrings are nice, but thought they would be bigger.",0
4,The spray does a good job. It lasts a couple of hours. I would recommend,1
5,Perfect,1
5,Great for outdoor school play. Easy to put the shoes - no laces is key for my little guy.,1
2,Broke after the second wear. The fit and material are nice though. I’m just bummed they didn’t last longer,0
1,Very poor quality! Not the same color on both sides.,0
3,"I really like wearing tops that have thumb holes.  As a tall woman, it is often difficult to find tops that have long enough sleeves or that are just long enough in general.  I ordered this shirt in size large based off of the sizing chart.  Also, large is my usual size.  I think it fits me well around the chest & midsection.  The sleeves could be a bit longer.  If I don't put my thumbs through the holes, the length is good but the sleeves feel stretched when I put my thumbs through.  I'd also prefer a shirt that's a little longer in the body.  Overall, the quality seems good & I really like the color.  The material is light & perfect for physical activities.  I think this would fit a more average height person perfectly.",0
1,"On some of the charms it doesn’t look like Mario and others Mario’s pink ,excess material.",0
1,"Fit didn’t match description, too big",0
2,"Not really liking the material, but I’ll give it a try",0
2,Fun coin to use with the hubby 👍🏽🙂 BUT too small for the price the charge,0
5,Pleasantly surprised at the quality of these dainty necklaces.  They don't look cheap and aren't tacky looking.,1
1,"First of all, to be up front, I did not buy this umbrella here, but was so compelled to write a review of this ""windproof"" umbrella because I was amazed how this thing broke like it was a delicate glass ornament falling from the top of a 12 foot Christmas Tree. I used this umbrella TWICE. Once was when I first got it, just to check it out, the second time was during an actual downpour. I guess the old saying that it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside is true, but only for the health of said umbrella. I opened the umbrella, walked to my garage from my car, lowered the open umbrella to the floor to dry out, and it didn't survive a 3 inch drop to the ground. Literally. I'm 5'9, I lowered the open umbrella with my arm fully extended to the ground, had to be no more than 3-5 inches, and this ""windproof"" umbrella broke like it was nothing. I'd be willing to bet this umbrella couldn't withstand a fart, let alone the wind this ""vortex"" claims to withstand. BUT! It does have a lifetime warranty. So if you want to find or pay for a box, find time in your busy day to go to your post office with the world's most ""convenient"" hours, or UPS store, ect. pay to ship it to the manufacturer, wait 2-4 weeks for processing for them to decide if it's warrantable, then possibly get a new/refurbished umbrella, then no worries. Me? Nah... Shedrain, You got me for the $25 I spent on this umbrella, I'll go buy a different umbrella and you can keep this review.<br />FYI... most companies that stand by their products don't require the end user to send anything back. A picture usually will suffice of the defective product and the company that stands behind their product will ship new merchandise to their customers door, free of charge.",0
3,"I really liked this romper which is why I ordered it, however when I received it I found it did not look as pictured. There was no black edging around the collar or sleeves as the picture shows. I got the grey one because I really liked how it looked with the black trim. What I received was all grey except for the trim around the ankles. I felt it looked plain without the rest of the trim being the same color.",0
5,Nice pants.,1
3,"Good material, lightweight and breathable. However this thing fits very tight for me. I’m hoping it will stretch a little to a more comfortable fit.",0
5,This watch is stunning!  It is worth every cent.  I look expensive and it feels expensive.  I love it.,1
3,I'm son wears 5.5 and his toes were pushing out the front. Looked cute. Will try the next size up,0
5,I've been wearing one of the hoops now for over 2 months. Very comfortable and I hardly even know it's in. The studs are so pretty and I love the selection!!,1
3,"Pants cute fit nice ,but came with turn belt loop",0
4,"This product is very cute and my litter sister loves it , made cheap like most children's toys but the price matched the quality.",1
1,I waited to late to return this item.  The black was bleeding into the white on the sleeves.,0
5,It fits nice and doesn't pinch.,1
1,Not as described. Colour deeper than described.,0
1,"This romper is so disproportionate that I couldn't even get my arms into it. I ordered a S - I'm 5'3, 140lbs - the pant length was suitable, but the top half was made for someone half my size. I thought it would be really cute, but boy was I disappointed.",0
5,I love the way made.,1
3,"very thin, see through, too big for my 5 (almost 6) year old.",0
1,This item is thick and large nothing like the picture or reviews.,0
3,worked well,0
5,Great for my safety glasses!!,1
1,It did not look like a dress it looks like a big sheet with the holes in it,0
3,The legging part rolls up... not cool.,0
2,Doesn’t stay in place well and is hot,0
5,"I am pleased with these earrings . They look &#34;real&#34; and unique . They are a bit smaller than I expected but actually that makes them more perfect  . I think they would make a very nice gift also but I will be keeping these babies for myself. I like also that they are easy and comfortable to wear , I don't feel that I have them on at all.  They have nice back pieces too , substantial and won't slip off .  The box they came in is okay but I think a better box would improve the overall gift presentation in my opinion . Fast ship directly from China , took about 10 days or so .",1
1,"The gloves were not comfortable and appeared to be cheaply made, so I returned them.",0
2,Not good quality,0
2,"Not good. Digs into sides of groin very uncomfortably. Also, band around thigh is tighter than rest of thigh - making a strange indent. So I can’t wear it under midi dresses as planned. For reference, I bought L/XL and I’m 5’5” 180, with weight spread evenly. Maybe a larger size would work better but I doubt it. Uncomfortable, unattractive, unusable.",0
4,Very cute.  I purchased a 4 but it looked like a 3.  Runs small.,1
1,The pearl fell off the stub. Hoping to exchange,0
2,Dislike for my granddaughter. The fit was not good. She has narrow feet and ankles.<br />The leather was good.,0
1,"We bought this from Costco 2 years ago, the quality of the socks can’t match with the previous purchases.",0
3,"Nice large umbella. But ... 1. there is a stress area on the connecting plastic fitting that attaches umbella to the support pole. Only had umbella for 4 weeks don't know if that will continue to weaken and break. 2. I bought a Hunter green one , after 2 weeks it has faded several shades.( color difference notice after leaving it closed using the strap around umbella while we were gone on vacation)  I did purchase a cover but still I should be able to leave it uncover during season of use without fading.",0
1,broken,0
1,"Be aware this dress is a cheap  fabric material size is too small i went up to one more size and it still too small , now i have to pay the shipping return fee. very dissapointed of this seller and company and amazon too , Amazon is not a very good place to shop for dresses.",0
5,Beautiful perfect fit & great quality,1
5,great size -loose fit.  I am 5 2 and 150. so the sleeves are a little long -but overall great coaching shirt,1
3,cute,0
1,Would not recommend.,0
5,Really short and I’m 5’1. But it’s precious!,1
3,"I know there are a lot of negative reviews on these but I thought I would offer maybe a slightly less negative review. They did take 9 weeks to arrive but actually fit ok, granted I bought a large normally wear a US small. I could see them being good for Halloween (order now for 2021) or maybe working out at home since they are pretty light weight",0
5,love these earrings! arrived fast and perfectly packaged. thanks!,1
1,"It should be titanium metal, hard to identify.<br />But the product is honest to mark stainless steal butterfly lock.",0
1,"My 8 year old(who is admittedly hard on shoes) got these and was so in love, 33 days after we got them while at recess a chunk came out of them. I contacted the company and they said Amazon returns policy and they won't do anything. So here I am writing my second negative review in a decade.",0
5,My 10 yr old son loves these and wears to school. They are soft and comfortable.,1
1,Arrived torn!!!,0
3,Disappointed,0
5,I love love love these Jammies! I've bought two pair so far. I buy a size up so they are loose and cozy. I love that they have no hood!,1
1,The letters are wonky and a 3x fits more like a Large. It runs extremely small.,0
1,"I am a tall girl that wears size 11 shoes. I don’t ever need wide sizes. While these boots fit my feet perfectly, they were way to small for my calves. I have never had this issue with boots before. Also, the shiny version that I ordered look super cheap. If you want to give them a try, get the matte.",0
4,I like the sports bras. The colors are great. I gave it four stars because it did not have a good stretch.,1
2,This skirt was way too big for me. I am 5'2 110 lbs. I bought a small. It was huge around the waist and too long.,0
3,"I like the ralph lauren sweaters, but they run very small, I usually wear a medium and in this brand I buy a L or XL. This one is XL is very soft and warm and fits like a relaxed cut because is XL. The only problem is that ends up being very boy but still does a good job to dress up or down.",0
3,They run small. Had to order a bigger size for my children. Is good quality but is the first time they run small.,0
5,"Adorable. Understated and classy while showing love for all things bunny.  Took a few weeks to arrive, but that's a-ok!",1
5,Very soft.,1
1,It didn't last long sleeves were torn its falling apart will not buy again,0
4,Not a fan of the design but it kept my baby warm.,1
3,"Was looking for a slouchy fit top to wear with leggings. I ordered a M when I normally wear S and it was still not flowy/draped enough. Kept it because it is a lovely T with high quality, though, and the color is fab.",0
3,Material not as expected. Not very comfortable.,0
5,No complaints.,1
1,There are some kind of corduroy styled pants that have the smallest imitation ridges to make them look like corduroy. They are some kind of synthetic material too. A cigarette ash landed on my pants and burned a hole in it revealing the lining material underneath. These pants should not be allowed to be sold as corduroy.,0
5,Well made and fits great.,1
3,Great watch band could use an additional link,0
5,Great gift,1
1,Super long even with heels …… the sleeves way to short …. I order two different sizes and each had negative things about them… wouldn’t recommend…,0
3,love them,0
4,I made a mistake in ordering a size too large but that fine cause I just wear them around the house. These legging are SUPER cute and comfy. You can definitely work out in these or just lounge around. You won’t be disappointed in buying this product.,1
3,"Had to pay to get it altered. Was too long, almost like a dress.",0
5,Very cute!,1
3,"I guess I should've read the hidden description. This shirt is not like the picture it's completely polyester. It reminds me of a child's Halloween custome. I've always wanted a Rolling Stones shirt & figured for the price of splurge on myself. I was so disappointed when I opened the package. Now I make sure not to go just by pictures but make sure to read what the material actually is. I thought maybe the more expensive ones they had, but in different colors, would atleast be cotton or something similar but no. Other than that I purchased my usual medium size & it fit but not like pictures. Since made of polyester, the fit was a bit snug & more than I wanted. I kept it for around house/PJ's.",0
5,"I love having pins on my knitting bag(s), but I'm tired of losing them and not being able to find replacements. These locking backs are the answer!! They easily lock so tightly that I can't get them off no matter how hard I try, and I have very strong hands (decades of playing piano, typing for a living, milking goats, and knitting). The included ""hex key"" works perfectly, and makes it so easy to remove the the back if you want to move the pin to a different bag. I'm sure I'll be ordering more soon, as friends always get me cute pins for birthday and Christmas, so I'll need locking backs for those!♥",1
5,"It didn't work perfect for me, since I wanted to fold it to be short and it isn't designed for that.  But if you like the longer style, this works fine, as expected.",1
4,muy bueno y de buena calidad,1
2,I used the size chart and read other reviews and it is WAY too big. I can't even wear it.,0
5,"These are amazing no-show socks. I have tried so many other brands, and I am only using these from now on. They are a tad too small, I am a size 9 and will order the men's version next.",1
1,Very uncomfortable. Doesn't work like it should.,0
5,Love it!! I bought this for an Easter outfit and the material is super comfy. Colorful and cute. Would definitely purchase again,1
5,Great price and nice quality,1
1,These are for little little children.,0
5,"I bought one for my wife, then was so pleased with the response that my mother got one too.  If looking for a different gift, and love Michigan or Petoskey Stone, I'd full recommend it.  The seller was very prompt and included nice handwritten notes.  Made two happy ladies out of this.",1
5,Its very light weight but still luv it. Sits well on my finger,1
5,"Ordered the wrong size by mistake but it turns out it was for the best. My son wears a 9 and I order a 10 but they fit just like a size 9. Other then they're not true to size, these are great cleats. Being able to personalize them was a added bonus",1
1,I purchased a XXL and torso wise it was still way too small.  Bust did not cover enough and did not have enough support.,0
5,Very pretty,1
5,Comfortable,1
5,"Very comfortable cap, colors were exactly as I expected but most of all, durable,",1
5,really nice case,1
5,"I bought these Elma Men's Touchscreen Texting Winter Italian gloves as a gift for my dad last Christmas.  He is very happy with them.  They look very nice, too!",1
4,Top runs small,1
5,Very comfortable. I do remove the pads because they make me sweat.,1
5,Just as expected......,1
5,Exactly what I wanted,1
3,Just didn't fit me well,0
4,"love it for lounging, but ripped out at neckine almost immediately:(",1
5,I LOVE this dress.  It was comfortable and made out of great quality fabric.  I ordered black (because black goes with everything) and have washed it multiple times...No fading or weird material stretching has happened.  It looked great with a pair of sandals that I wore to a festival.  This is a casual item not sure how much you can dress it up.  I was very happy with this find!!!!,1
3,"I did not actually receive a prink skirt that folded over. It does not fold over at all. However, I decided to keep it as I was looking for a pink summer skirt. I like the fit and it is easy to wash but I would not put in the drier. In fact, I don't put these skirts in the drier because I don't want to ruin them. Instead, I line dry them and after a few hours the skirt looks great. I am planning on purchasing a black skirt for winter.",0
3,My specific bracelet was off colored. It was more red than maroon.,0
4,"Very cute girls trench. So many compliments! The sleeves were a bit long, but we were able to cuff them. Looks more costly than it was.",1
2,"this bangle is gigantic. I could probably wear it on my ankle if i tried. (i have 7.5in wrists) the two pearls on the ends of this cuff make it so heavy that they swing down, defeating the whole purpose. Pretty, but kind of pointless.",0
1,The design stated to wear off within minutes of wearing it. I returned it within a week because it was almost all work away. Do not but this product.,0
4,"This is purchase if you're looking to not break the bank buying gym clothes. These tops are light and fit well. I've put them through the wash a handful of times so far. So I can't have an opinion regarding durability just yet. However, since they come in packs of three, I don't see it being an immediate issue. The only down side for me is the lack of variety in colors but I'll definitely be ordering more in the future.",1
5,Very comfortable.  waist doesn't roll down.  My new daily uniform,1
1,"This shirt looks nothing like the pictures.  No tags on it, save yourself the money.",0
1,"45% viscose, 15% polyester, 30% linen, 10% cotton",0
5,The time-of-day is readable and day of the week and date functions are useful.  It is reasonably easy to set. The watch is light on my wrist and unobtrustive to me.,1
3,"Buen material. Pero no es la medida, le pedí un talla más grande a mi bebé, y aún así le quedó muy pequeño",0
5,Great for travel.  folds flat and can hold quite a bit!,1
1,Cannot see the image; small and out of focus.,0
2,Way too small.  I ordered an XL as a 6'2&#34; male and it didn't fit right.  The hood sat funny and I couldn't even use it.,0
3,"Pretty, but a little smaller than I expected.",0
3,Wrinkles very easily,0
3,"These are soft and warm. Price is affordable.  The negative is that they are a bit too big for me, and slide off my ears and down to my neck. I am a female with an average head size.",0
5,Comfortable & fit well.,1
1,Mine looked nothing like the picture colors are not the same weird fabric patterns. It's ugly,0
2,"They look good, but they a bit too dark for true Lapis lazuli, and they dyed my earlobes blue.<br />So..purchase at your own discretion.",0
5,"Great fit, perfect for driving, as always persol quality an look is spot on",1
5,"High quality replacement aftermarket remote that worked on my Chamberlain garage opener. My color is purple and 315mhz. Works great. Easy to program.<br />Everything is included clip, battery and instructions. For a very reasonable price.<br />- high quality replacement remote",1
1,The neck in this is so so tiny it’s ridiculous,0
2,"I have a pretty small head and this fits me really tight. Receiver piece free floats inside hat with only tiny piece of Velcro holding it in place. Said Velcro is poorly applied, broke off first day of use. Hat fits tight and weird, not sure how they found a model to make it look so good in the pics, must have taken them a LONG time to find that guy. Redemption: after inspecting the packaging I found a small pack with extra Velcro, too bad I already super glued the old one back on",0
3,"It's very cute i usually wear a medium in swim suits i'm 5'7"" with butt measurement of 40in so per size chart should be a medium and so i ordered a medium. it's ginormous on me especially the bottoms, top is ok. i dont know if i want to deal with returns since it was cheap probably going to give to a friend. Overall would recommend just get a smaller size, it's nicely made.",0
5,Fast delivery. Great tags,1
1,"You cannot see through these ""glasses"".<br /><br />Give your kid a coat-hanger and a couple magnifying glasses and he will come up with something much better than this product.<br /><br />They are garbage. I ordered them around last halloween and I never even used them. ""Lenses"" are plastic and I believe you can't even remove them so literally these ""frames"" are useless.",0
5,This jacket is warm but yet very light and very comfortable for the price! I don’t think you would be disappointed! And excellent buy for the money! True to size!,1
3,They are a little tighter than I would like. Even with them off they are pretty tight on the neck and I’m an average size,0
1,Not leather!,0
5,Protects my eyes from debris concrete dust sawdust from getting in my eyes 👌🏽,1
2,"These are ok pants if you don't find anything else and provided you find your correct size. I don't think they are designed with woman in mind. They look more like men's pants or at least unisex. The fabric feels plastic, the pockets will tear down easily if you will keep keys in them. The color is different than on the current picture - more greenish. They dry quickly. I ordered several pants with different sizing (maybe not those pants) but from the same company. All of them were off - either the waist was too big or the pant legs were too wide. I own one of them and I will be looking for something else. The pants came with a cheap belt too (it  is not depicted in the picture).<br /><br />I do not recommend them for women, and I don't believe the pants will be durable. They look nice on the photos but not for real ...",0
1,Order 2-3 sizes up. I'm usually an xl and had to reorder,0
5,"Little smaller than expected, but very beautiful!!! Love it....",1
5,"I got this for my toddler going through a picky phase and he will actually wear his ""glasses shirt"" without a fuss. Priced right and sizing is generous so I'm a happy mama.",1
1,"I got this toe ring, very nice. Already broke! the product is very thin material.",0
2,It was just an awkward fit... maybe it's just meant for skinny people,0
5,Very soft and lovely print.,1
2,Material catches on everything and had snags in the cloth on the first wearing.,0
1,"Did not fit at all, I’m a size 10 and it wasn’t even close 🥲 the material was awful and so stiff, too.",0
4,This is a very nice scarf that can be worn with anything.,1
2,"These pants fit, but they lay in a kind of awkward way. The color is ugly. I'm just not really a fan of them.",0
1,It was way too big for our kids,0
1,The description and picture did not match the product. I was sending back but I missed the time up send it back.,0
1,"They look good but are extremely fragile, don’t recommend. They lasted me 2 days",0
1,It's cool that they tried to make something similar but honestly ur taking away the realness of tho item in the movie don't try to redo something that isn't meant to be redone,0
2,The band feels and looks cheap. Colors are def not as bright and vivid as in the product photo.,0
5,Very easy to install.  It is longer than the Fitbit band but that is not a problem.,1
3,"I am petite 5' 2"" and 118 lbs so I ordered a small in the white color. I also ordered a small in olive and it fit different. It was shorter and seemed wider and boxy looking. Not sure why that would be unless a different manufacturer/country makes the same shirt.",0
3,Only had it for a week and it already has a tear in the inside of the bag. Nice design but the tear is a disappointment.,0
5,Dress is great very comfortable,1
1,these were a big disappointment.  both fell out the first day I wore them.  the Velcro strap is too 'short' so it doesn't hold tightly enough on the bra strap.  Many years ago I had a great pair of Velcro strap shoulder pads that worked well so I know it is possible.  these are also very small -- not that I want large 80's style shoulder pads but they could be 'thin' and well shaped and still be a nice size.,0
2,"Too expensive for this, my",0
5,Bought these for my college age son going to school in Wisconsin.  He says Wisconsin winters are colder than he expected.  Loves the pocket for hand warmers and says that they do the trick for the long walks to and from classes and his residence.,1
1,"This item came solid vacuum sealed in a head block from China.  It doesn’t feel like real material. Looks like it’s made from paper shreddings.. seems dirty and weird.  what a rip off ....yuck.  This is awful, cheap and gross.",0
1,"This is the thinnest material I have ever seen in a t-shirt! A cheap, poorly made import shirt from China. Thanks to Amazon and their generous return policy, I have already processed a return.",0
3,"This item is attractive, and serves its purpose, but it arrived with a missing piece to the zipper. I would not purchase from this company again, as it was clear when it was packaged that it was missing the a piece on the zipper",0
5,Fit loose but I still ordered my normal size.,1
3,Fits small but cute does not fit on the bigger girls like the model shown.,0
5,Love how these fit. They are very comfortable and keep me tucked in.<br />Perfect product for yoga,1
5,"I need a digital watch charged with solar power so as not to worry about running out of battery during a trip of multi-day hiking in the wilderness. Barometer recording overnight at a camp site that might indicate change of weather is a plus. Then I bought a Casio Men's Pro Trek PRG-270-1 Tough Solar Triple Sensor Multifunction Digital Sport Watch to meet these purposes. However, this watch reset itself twice during a three week hiking that was scary. Fortunately I used my smartphone that was usually turned off to get the correct time back. This watch reset itself many times when staying in a heated warm room multiple nights later on. Some reviewers said it was due to an electrostatic problem in a dry environment, which seems to be consistent with what I observed. So I decided to buy this Casio Men's Pro Trek PRW3500 Solar Powered Atomic Digital Watch. Tested it in northern CA finding out it could be synchronized to the right time. It seems to solve the problem. The displayed letters on PRW3500 are slightly larger than that on PRG-270, thus also appearing. Can't wait to wear it in my next multi-day hiking this summer. A suggestion: the screen of my PRG-270 got many scratches easily in the wilderness. The screen of PRW3500 is made of quartz instead of ""Japanese quartz"" of PRG-270; presumably the former could also get scratches easily. So I bought some screen protectors, which are available on Amazon, for PRW3500 too.<br /><br />Edit: After three month experience with this new watch I realized this watch has a design flaw. I wear it on my left wrist as most men do. Its BARO button is on the right side but protruding too much down. It is thus constantly rubbing the back of hand whenever I lay down my hand and moving my palm. It makes a scratch wound that is difficult to heal. PRG-270 has no such problem on the contrary. I recommend Casio redesign it to remove this flaw.",1
2,I've barely warn this ring and the stones are losing their color. They started out such a bright pretty yellow. Now some are totally white and others are faded. SUPER Sad,0
3,Nice looking but really do not care for the small cord tied in front. Fit is a touch snug. Purchased two pair will probably not get any more.,0
2,Don't seem well made. After one wear the pattern is fading. Pretty thin material. Might might ok pajama pants but won't wear them otherwise. Had really hoped they were more like leggings but they aren't.,0
2,Already falling apart.,0
1,Had to be returned! Planned for Oktoberfest but was clearly not white definitely more yellow & beige. Nice quality but unsuitable,0
2,Item came scratched up and looked like it had been laying around in someone's drawer for years.,0
2,"Be vigilant if you select the &#34;Red&#34; picture in the 2nd row (looks like dark, brick red).  When I did, &#34;Burgundy/blk&#34; was put into my cart and I got a color that my son didn't want. (I pretended to start a new order and the same thing happened).  The seller is offering me a refund, but now I don't have the present under the tree that I wanted to give to my son.",0
5,"Easy to change out, comfortable, fast shipping,  works great with my charge 3",1
5,"These are the perfect work pants or if needed, for play. They are the perfect length for me with 3inch heels. Love the material and fit. I’m normally a 10, but bought a 12 (because they’re more of a trouser) and it’s great. The pants sit perfectly on my hips and have just enough stretch!!  Buy these pants!",1
2,Good fit but they balloon out which makes it look like you're wearing safari shorts. I've yet to wear them because they look weird with everything.,0
5,"Love this cute hat! Protected my face in Florida! Fits as expected, looks great on both sides!",1
1,"These dresses are AWFUL. look nothing like the picture, the size is off, they are NOT maxi, the quality is horrible. It's cheap net tacked onto some skin pantyhose like material. I ordered 2 and they are going straight back.",0

5,gave as gift person liked it allot,1
5,"Nice suit, fit nice",1
5,I took some people's advice and sized up. I love the dress and find the pockets are handy.,1
5,"Great socks, I'm thick in the thighs and these don't cut in or squish like taller thigh highs, leaving my legs to look thick and toned. Real cute!",1

5,Excellent I love it,1
5, ,1
3,It really is a beautiful cut and nicely made. I am a very busty girl so the arm holes were to tight when I lifted my arms.. so I gave to my co worker... she loved it... That is the down fall of big chested people I don't fit into most sized things .,0
5,I am so satisfied with the quality of this bracelet! I have gotten so many compliments on how beautiful the bracelet looks! I recommend purchasing from this seller!,1
5,Will only order from this company Great Price and they are excellent quality.,1
4,Like them,1
5,Granddaughter loves them and they hold up well,1
4,"The jacket is perfect, hat is super small and shoes are kind of silly.  Defiantly not worth $70 but will keep it because my daughter needs it for a play she’s in.",1
1,The jeep was not centered on the brim. And the hat did not look like the photo.,0
2,"The first day I try it on, the dress broke on the back. The chest it is tight and loose on the button. The fabric is itchy. I had not opportunity of wear it for the event I wanted it.",0
1,Love the fit. Love the pockets.<br /><br />Tore hole in back after 3 weeks :-(,0
2,Thin material,0
3,Sports bra runs small with stiff styrofoam padding that I removed. It’s snug but I ended up keeping it to keep the girls in place.,0
5,Fits great! Awesome print! 🤘🏻 CFH !!!,1
1,flags not printed well very low quality,0
3,"Meh. Runs small. XXL is more like a L. It's cute and I really love the straps, but not really the size I'd hoped for. Not sure if I'll wear it as it's tight and makes me feel self conscious.",0
5,Me and my coworkers loved it.,1
2,This necklace smiley pendant was much smaller than what the picture suggested!!,0
1,T-shirt is damage and no support,0
5,Love it!,1
1,"Not as described,  way smaller ring size and figure cannot be seen.",0
5,"Good price, on time delivery. Great buy!",1
4,"These are really cute keys.  They are small though, so make sure you look at the size before ordering.  I used them to make flying keys for a Harry Potter party and they worked well.",1
5,A+ Seller. Item was exactly as described and delivered on time. Good Business!!,1
5,"Bit smaller than I expected, but sturdy and organized and perfect for everyday use.",1
1,The ad was for multiple colors and I only received one!,0
5,These work great! I used them on the bottom of my toddlers shoes and they are perfect for non-slip!,1
3,"Boots are really cute, just wish they didnt run so narrow. I dont have a wide foot, but i dont have a narrow one either. They also dont seem to be the best quality but arent the worst. Bummed i wont be able to wear these.",0
3,The part around your wrist isn't fitting way too loose and short in arm length and at waist.,0
5,I use these when I resin. They protect my arms perfectly.,1
5,They fit me right. Gives great support and are very comfortable. Definitely will buy again.,1
2,Very thin and feels cheap and itchy.  I returned it.,0
1,Too small second one bought first fit great bought second one in same size too small,0
2,Was way too large for me and there were very visible defects in the design. The colors are nice but I was disappointed that there was blue threading that ran into the other colored stripes in quite a few places which is hard to overlook. At first I thought it might be part of the design but upon closer examination I realized that it was not. I had to return it- but may try again in hopes of not receiving a defective product because I really like the sweater.,0
5,Great watch . I wear it every day .,1
5,Great fit and colors!,1
2,the watch looked great and seemed to be be made well. unfortunately it was too big for my son's wrist and i had to return it.,0
5,The dress is simply beautiful and elegant. I'm 5'4.<br />250lbs and the coverage is fantastic. I'm always trying to find the dress that hide by apple shape and it did perfectly. It's also very comfortable. I recieved so many compliments. I felt like a million dollars. The price is fantastic.  I will be ordering this dress in another color.,1
2,The pant runs 2-3 sizes too small and are not long enough,0
1,"If you want another pair of black sunglasses, the purple ones are the ones to get.  Yes, they can be seen as purple, if you look very hard and just the right way.  No they do not look ANYTHING like the photo.  Very disappointed.",0
2,I love these glasses but Im on my second set because  the legs on them come off easily.,0
2,"The product was neatly packaged and shipped on time. However, the fabric is very thin and does not give a good feeling. I would not recommend this product.",0
5,"This dress was perfect. I ordered a 14, & it Fit like a glove. Super comfortable & I got complements all night at the event I wore it too.",1
3,Wish they made plus size for bustier women.  I'm a XL in 75 % of my clothing. This Did not fit.,0
1,Looks and feels like a nightgown.,0
5,beautifu;,1
1,The red one is not a sweater at all. It’s a very thin cotton and could pass as a short robe more than a shirt. Not flattering. I returned it.,0
1,Worst quality ever. China cheapest of the cheapest plastic material. I threw them out but I should of gotten my Mo eye back. It was so bad that I couldn’t even give it to anyone for free. Black garbage bag has a better material that this nonesence.,0
5,"I loved the multi colors, its lightweight and comfortable.  Serves my purpose on a bad hair day. Can be be worn with several colors. Not cheap looking. Good material. Perfect!",1
5,Nice thick material.  little larger in size . colorful graphics.  well made,1
3,Bra looks very cute on but since it is one size  fits all if your bustier like myself I wear a 36 D which is a pretty big size for a one size fits all kind of thing it does not fit properly my boobs spill come out of the bottom a little but its very cute I will keep it just to wear around the house but don't feel confident it will keep everything in if I tried to wear it with an outfit. I would next time order something similar that gives you an option size like a large.,0
5,It's a real Azabache! Great quality.,1
1,"Material is thin, a little see through, itchy, and probably not breathable. It looks like a nightgown but I wouldn’t even wear it for that because of how the material feels. Going to process a return. It fits too tight in the chest area and I’m a 34/36. The length was right at my knees.",0
2,"Product is so cute in present. But what good is that to me if I order a 4x (size 28) and get a size 18. Must send it back, waste of my valuable time,",0
3,"this itemm came in a few days in a resealable platic bag.. works great cleaning silver, but I was disappointed with the small size.. when i reread the description, I see they offer a larger one which would be better",0
5,"Warm, dry and comfortable.  No more frozen fingers.  Would buy again.",1
5,"I wasn't sure what to expect when ordering this keychain. I thought the keychain fit my personality perfectly. I'd have a cat to facepalm all the silly stuff I do during the day. When it arrived I was happy to note that the material is a hard plastic, not a squishy or gummy texture but a smooth hard plastic. My keychains take a beating and so far it seems to be standing up to the abuse.<br />The keychain arrived with a pin that held the ring open, so putting it on my keyring was simple. There's a little bell on the keyring which makes a soft jingle sound as you walk or move your keys around, almost like having a kitten with  a bell on its collar.<br />I plan to buy more of these for family and friends and totally recommend!",1
5,"These were the absolute best leggings I've ever owned, super soft and comfortable, and weren't too thin so they kept me warm.<br /><br />Unfortunately they got caught on a nail and got ripped, so I can't wear them any more but I will definitely be buying more, and I cannot wait to do so!<br /><br />10 out of 10 definitely recommend!",1
1,To big and ugly I will never put this on.,0
2,Wife said these feel like they are going to fall apart every time she puts them on. There is also no zipper so you will stretch it out putting it on over time. Will not last long!,0
5,"looks good, fits perfectly, nice shape. I bought it for my elderly mother, she enjoys wearing them. She says, that it so comfortable and warm, just like she would wear warm slippers.",1
1,"This product is very cheap and doesn't fit anywhere like the stock photo. It is not high waist and definitely not big booty friendly. The outfit came to me with a hole in the waist as though it was not sewn all the way. I got the 2XL because I have larger arms but this did not accomodate my arms like how normal 2XL clothing does. The pants fit at the waist in the front, while the back could not accomodate my booty, therefore, there was no way I could actually wear this out the house. The material was super cheap and rough, it is not something you would want against your skin as it is irritating.",0
4,"It's a nice, fun top...but it does run big, and I wish the sleeves weren't so super long.",1
5,HAPPY WITH PURCHAE,1
5,Love it.,1
1,The material is extremely cheap. It broke the next day,0
1,The ankle collars are nothing like the picture there extremely loose and don’t go all the way down,0
1,Shirt fit weird and not like the picture. I ordered a small and it was super baggy,0
5,good length.,1
1,The shoe in the picture is not what the shoe looks like in real life,0
5,Great.!,1
1,Not a Polarized Lens and does not Fit over my prescription glasses. No cleaning cloth. Disappointed.,0
3,Dress fit was smaller so it was returned.,0
1,"The item is listed as a zipper hoodie, but there is no zipper. As well as the size information is incorrect. Shipping took way too long and over all I was extremely disappointed.",0
4,The sleeves are kind of wide but otherwise a cute shirt. Very thin.,1
1,"I was going to order a small but decided to order a medium. Still runs small.<br />Also, white bra is very misleading. The pad isn’t covered.",0
5,"Love everything about the top, fits amazing..ordered a medium and wear a 32 DDD, the bottoms are a bit showy but not too bad",1
1,Good length and fit but very thin cheap material. Not cute.,0
5,Loved them are perfect received a lot of compliments,1
3,"It's super cute but pretty small. I was expecting it to be a bit bigger. It's maybe the size of 2 quarters overlapping. But again, it's REALLY cute.",0
3,"Super light, pliable, strong, simple---exactly what I wanted. But I returned it because the sleeves for credit card are so shallow that the cards slip out easily. When accessing my wallet outside, I am always wary of cards falling out, and this design begs for that to happen. Fatal flaw.",0
5,This is the bag I was looking for! Has enough space and pockets for everything. Was a great price too.,1
5,Great,1
5,"Really pretty snowflake design earring with lots of sparkle. Perfect for parties, everyday weather or glamour. They are lightweight, comfortable with hook findings. The design is well executed and they really look expensive. Who doesn’t love falling fau diamond snowflakes. They are the best kind. This is definitely giftable.",1
4,Company customer service is AWESOME! Received my replacement package and tried them one and they fit well and feel wonderful. I cannot wait to wear them to my next Barre class.,1
4,"Very nice, thick material. I like that a lot, and my husband loves the deep green color. It is a bit too large, but next time I'll know to order a smaller size.",1
5,Great low cut boot.  Stylish look too.,1
5,"I did not expect this to be as high of quality as it was. This is a heavy, tight knit cardigan, very warm and well made. Fits great and true to size.",1
2,It’s beautiful but not able to adjust after so many trials have to return,0
5,"Is also a very comfortable under garment in almost all situations & temps. I got four whites, would like to get the light grays next.<br />I am six feet & 170 pounds & a Large size fits  great.",1
1,There were not the color pictured.,0
2,"I wouldn't recommend purchasing this hat. They really should show the picture with the flamingo's neck laying over on the side because there was no way it was going to stand up. The quality of workmanship and material was really bad, also. It wouldn't have been worth half the price I paid.",0
1,Crappy bag. Ripped twice.,0
4,Pretty,1
5,Love it,1
5,I normally wear small  but ordered a medium. This costume run a little small.,1
1,"I did not like this item, once i started taking it out of the bag a bunch of stars and glitter sprinkles came out. Once i saw that i immediately placed it back in the bag. I had to order another skirt. So this one is going back.",0
1,"I love the thickness of the jacket, the feeling on the skin is nice, but the size was about 2 sizes too small.<br />I’m keeping it because I’m on a diet and losing weight.",0
1,"My daughter is 10 years old, bought these for school uniform.  These shoes did not make it past the 3 month mark!!!  the sole started becoming unattached from the shoe, as shown in pictures by other customers.  Now I see why we buy the expensive classic kid shoe brand that this model is copied from!  They may cost over double but they usually last the entire school season!  This shoe not worth the savings as they don't last.",0
2,Sucks I have bald head so this is useless for my head . It slips off imediately. It does warm your ear for a second then you have to adjust it every 5 seconds . Don't waste your money on this thing it sucks.,0
2,Not as wide as my 8 year old grandson would have liked. He's average weight and height. More for a child under five.,0
5,"REALLY HELPS DRIVING AT NIGHT, ALSO BRIGHTENS ROAD WHEN DRIVING IN FOG.",1
3,Quality is just “ok”. The cuffing around the wrists and bottom aren’t the same color as the rest of the jacket.,0
5,Very pretty shoes and comfy,1
5,Excellent socks. Fit as describe in Smartwool chart. Love them!,1
2,"Two stars for the pretty.  But it's way out of proportion for a woman's body, which surprised me seeing I purchased other clothing items from this brand.",0
2,The material looks very cheap. The white you can see through,0
2,"Is cute but it runs to big, sad I couldn’t wear it.",0
5,"Pretty piece. Great service.....Be detailed? Every time I do I get rejected. So I'll just keep it simple....Pretty, pretty, pretty....",1
3,I’ve had this for a while and so far it has held up but the metal block is really chunky and the edges are kind of sharp.,0
5,Only time will tell how good this winder is.After two weeks so far so good.,1
5, ,1
5,So comfortable,1
5,I absolutely love this shirt. It can be worn with a vest to dress it up some or just plain to be casual.  It is not too heavy to use to layer.  Definitely a new staple in my wardrobe,1
5,"Beautiful HAWAII hat! The 3D embroidery is excellent! The flag design on the bill is very good quality! Great price too! I did not have high expectations when ordering this hat, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. I will order more as this is a perfect hat for Hawaiians living abroad!",1
2,10 BUCKS for 2 of these. I really hope they work. UPDATE- they do not work to keep your keys on like it says. my keys have slipped off twice already. Very disappointing. Save your money for something that works.,0
5,Love it,1
5,Obsessed with these chokers love all of them!,1
5,I got my locket from ebay and buying the charms is sooooo much fun!!!!  I wish I could afford them all!!!,1
5,This dress is nice. Comfortable and has a hint of sexy. I like it.,1
5,"Great colors and great value.  I would definitely purchase more products from the same line. These look great and can be dressed up or down.  They seem solidly made, as headbands go.",1
5,👍,1
3,"took a long time to get, but it fit good",0
1,Plastic.,0
5,Beautiful,1
2,Way to small,0
5,It looks terrific!,1
5,I love this dress. it is very good quality for the price.  It runs small. I tried a medium but wore the large. I am usually a Medium. I am 5’4. 120 pounds and 34 DD.  The length was great on me. The hem hit the floor on one side but it didn’t affect my mobility. On a taller woman it would be fine too.,1
5,Arrived in time for Christmas. Was as expected,1
5,It fits perfectly and helps me sweat.,1
5,"I bought this outfit for a tea party it was absolutely perfect. It fit well, it was comfortable and of course I I felt like I was life in action. 😂",1
5,"Pretty brilliant design. Once you try this style of belt, traditional fastening buckles won’t feel right.",1
2,"Broke the first day, so upset.",0
1,"Just came one, looked like the picture, and it is more little than i was expecting.",0
1,Appears cheap and over-priced. Also quite uncomfortable to wear.,0
5,I LOVE the shirt!! I will definitely be purchasing several more in different colors. It fits as described. The length is perfect! It is soft and comfortable! I’m very satisfied. Great quality. The only thing that I would prefer is that the neckline not be so wide. It’s a little loose around the neck but other than that it’s perfect!,1
1,Buyer Beware. These are NOT returnable and that was not clearly shown in the listing.  They may work for an adult but they did nothing but slip off of the temple of youth sized glasses.,0
5,5 stars,1
3,Nice coat lousy zipper. Coat was very warm fit very nice but the zipper split the third time I wore it.,0
3,It was a bit shorter than other similar dresses I have ordered in the past.  I’m 5’9”. Not safe for my work so had to return it but otherwise is a great dress.,0
5,Very nice comfortable fit.,1
1,"Length is decent. Chest size way oversized. I measure at a 38, but this 38 could fit two of me.",0
1,size 3x was a size xl. product klingy when wet.,0
5,"Nice quality spandex cover. I've ordered 4 of them now in different sizes.<br /><br />I have a 20&#34; (23&#34; diagonal) and 28&#34; (31&#34; diagonal) pair of Samsonite hardside spinner luggage. The measurements seem to be between sizes for these spandex covers.<br /><br />The MEDIUM cover is way too large for the 20&#34; spinner, so I plan to order a SMALL once it is back in stock.<br /><br />The XL cover is also too large for the 28&#34; spinner. The LARGE cover is nearly a perfect fit, although it takes a bit of stretching to get the zipper to close.",1
5,I like the texture of the frame also the the style,1
1,These are worthless. They do not stay up on my son’s head.,0
5,"We ordered this set for a theatre performance.  The skirt (in particular), looked great and fairly realistic.  My daughter was @ 5'4"" ... and it seemed a little shorter than we had hoped for (but it depends on what you need).  You'll need shorts or something underneath of it.",1
4,I love love LOVE this suit! It's exactly like the picture. This suit gives me confidence by being cute and but also still feeling more modest (it shows just enough). Flattering and cute one pieces can be hard to find but this one takes the cake! The material also doesn't pill as much as other cheap suits on Amazon. The material is pretty thick as well and the padding in the chest is nice as well.<br /><br />That being said here's the one con I could find: the fit for my body shape. The padding was overkill for my chest (I'm a 36 C). For bigger chested folks this may be a huge plus! In fact this suit may provide you with a bit more support than other thinner and more flimsy suits (although if you have a massive rack I don't think this will provide enough as it doesn't hold and lift like a bra would). I also had some fit issues because my bottom half is larger than my upper half. The bottoms fit perfectly but the chest part had some extra fabric around my arm pits. You can't tell visually but as the wearer I could feel it. I would have preferred a more snug fit. Again I think if I had more up top to fill it out I wouldn't have had this issue (or if I was more proportionate). I thought about exchanging for a smaller size to see if that would fix the issue but I figured if I did that then the bottoms would not fit.<br /><br />All in all I love this suit and may have to buy it in different colors!,1
5,"I bought this for my friend that has cancer. I thought this would be a different &quot;take&quot; on a guardian angel. The &quot;beat it, just beat it&quot; turns out to be the perfect mantra for her!",1
3,i like the colors... like the picture,0
2,I really loved this dress... but I only got to wear it once!! I washed it once in cold water and the purple bled into the white. I was really disappointed because it looked great on and was very comfortable.,0
2,Good,0
5,Granddaughter was super excited to receive this as a gift. Thanks for making it available - it made her very happy!,1
5,It was delivered quickly and the quality is good.,1
5,I LOVE THIS SHIRT! It’s super flowy and flattering and loose on the arms.,1
5,My son loves his new sunglasses. They are very comfortable and block out the sun well. He is a life guard so he knows how important it is to protect your eyes from UV rays,1
1,"As soon as I put them on, one of the ratings broke.",0
2,"Every piece is super cute but I was having a heck of a time trying to get the ball spun on to hold it in, they were way to small and just more trouble then I found them to be worth. A tad bit disappointed.",0
5,Comfy tubesock style toe socks!  Great price! Made well! Nice length.. not to tight around upper ankles..,1
1,Not a fan.. Not really “so breathable”.,0
4,It's cute but I was looking for something for work. It's a bit too fitted for that but I guess it depends on where you work. The quality of the dress is nice.,1
1,Look terribly cheap! Not at all close to what's pictured,0
5,"This bag is beautiful / perfect summer bag, not heavy and plenty of room . Would definitely buy Sakroots handbags again.",1
3,"nice hat, just a little to big even when adjusting didn't fit right",0
2,Medium was a little too tight and not long enough to cover my butt. I returned it and ordered an XL. The fit is better on the top but not by much and it still falls just below my butt so there’s absolutely no bending room. There’s no flapper sway in this dress at all.,0
1,"Bought 2 pairs and one of them arrived broken. 👎 Very cheap quality. Don't buy these for real wear, they're only meant to be ""costume"" shades.",0
5,Exactly what I was looking for. A simple digital watch with a date stamp. Bonus that it has the days initial as well.,1
5,Cute bands and they are easy to change out.,1
1,I could not tell the difference,0
3,"This product is a very nice product. However, I have taken away 2 stars for 2 reasons (1 of which is significant). Firstly, I ordered the black KO po ah, but received the white one with a black band around the Hebrew words. Secondly, it is a bit snug. A friend of mine who wears these on a daily basis says it tends to stretch over usage. Overall, I am happy with this purchase, as I was going to purchase a white one as well. (I wanted a black one and a white one). Despite the 3 star review, I do recommend this product. My issues were minor.",0
1,"I bought this dress in a small and it looks like a bed sheet. Way too large, not flattering at all, will not look anything like this picture.",0
5,Very nice,1
4,"Prwhen product mentions T-shirt,it should be the fabric of a T-shirt. I still like the way it looks on but not crazy about the clingy Jersey material Product exactly like description Received on time",1
5,Took a long time to get them but so cute!,1
5,So many complements on this set so fun and festive !!,1
3,"I love the material.  It's soft, it's cool in the summer, and you just WANT to wear it.  But the cut is too straight if you have hips.",0
2,Took almost,0
5,Great shirt!,1
3,"The jacket arrives vacuum packaged in a small envelope, which is handy for shipment, but the jacket was very wrinkled when we took it out of the package. The material is quite thin and probably is more of a wind breaker than a heavier jacket. For the price, I thought it was a little high based on the quality. We ended up getting a size 14 jacket. Our son, 13, is in the picture wearing the jacket. It barely fits him so I would recommend going up a size. In our case, we are going to give it to our nephew instead since he is a couple years younger. The other thing that is weird that there are no tags on it so it looks strange if you are trying to give this as a gift.  However, the styling is cool and we think our nephew will like it.",0
3,"This is a nice looking watch, but after 3 days of wear had noticeable scratches on it. I work in medicine with patients so not the kind of job where the watch is banging around or being worn during lots of physical work. I was disappointed in the quality. It still looks nice enough, keeps time and is comfortable but the quality isn't outstanding.",0
3,got holes easily,0
2,"Looked good, but the chain broke within a couple wearings. Not well made. You get what you pay for. If you only want to wear this once and throw it away, I suppose it's worth the money. If you want to give a gift to somebody you really don't like, and want to look bad, this is the item for you . . .",0
1,just got this and abs LOVED it!! wore it for not even an hour and it broke :( so upset. the knot came undone,0
5,"I really like the fit, not too tight but not loose like a regular pair of shorts. They did ride up a little in between the legs so if your looking for tight no ride up these won’t work for you.",1
3,"The ring that's attached to lobster clasp and the charm wasn't soldered and the clasp came off the ring through the tiny gap. They need to do a better job with their workmanship, otherwise the charm itself is quite nice.",0
3,"My 11yr old niece is having a solar systems birthday party, so I bought this on a whim.  The bracelet seems fairly cheaply made and is a couple of pieces so you can make it longer or shorter.  Personally, as an adult, I would not wear this bracelet.  But for an 11yr old, it was a complete hit!",0
2,Looks cheap,0
5,Perfect!!,1
4,"Love the color. Love the softness. Do not love the lack of support. But again, the color is great!",1
4,"Bigger than I pictured on my face. Just a tiny bit smaller, for me, would be great! Otherwise, would have been 5 Stars!",1
2,"They are long and bunch up in the bag. I purchased them because they are cute, they have already started unravelling",0
1,"These are very cheaply made.  Crooked, flimsy plastic.  Not even worth sending back.",0
3,"OK, but too large!",0
1,Balls easily broke off both rings. The ring is too hard to open.,0
4,This bra looks and feels really nice and I also like the color but it's a little snug and gives some armpit fat that I'm just not a fan of. I love the strappy back and longline look but the fit just wasn't quite right for me.,1
1,Very poor quality. Stitches are white on a dark blue color tshirt and the tag is sewed for outside of the shirt. Shorts are almost see thru. Overall the worst set of clothes I’ve received. Don’t waste your time or your money. Will be returning,0
2,I don't like the cheap feel of the fabric and it is see through. It is a cute summer dress and would have been ok with the fabric as long as it was not see through..,0
4,"Love the shirt, very comfy. Material is soft. The fit was just a little big at the shoulders for me think I should have got a small. I’m 5’4 130lbs",1
5,I love them so much I'm gonna order more so I can wear them everyday!!!,1
5,"Love these pants!  I order a size down because I like them to fit really snug.  Pant size 4, I ordered XS and they fit nice and tight without being see-thru at all!  Love the thick material, keep everything smooth!",1
1,"Did not receive what was pictured! If I knew what it really looked like I would not have purchased it. Necklace is just a long chain with different colored, oblong pearls strung on it. It is a pretty necklace, just not for me.",0
5,Great dress,1
3,The socks had a very strong perfume smell when they arrived.  You could smell them through the packaging.,0
3,"My first impressions out of the package were:  1. I ordered the wrong color and 2, this looks like a mens vneck sweater.<br /><br />Color-it is a very gray khaki, not the more brownish tone shown in the picture. I paired it with white jeans too for comparison with model's pic. I don't mind it but it wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />Fit - it really looked like a men's vneck, but wearing it, you can tell the arms are definitely for women, and it is slightly tapered at the sides. But it doesn't fit like the picture. I also had to trim 3 sections of leftover thread hanging off.<br /><br />Length- this is a M. I had to tuck it in up front for the picture because it's so long! It hangs to the bottom of my pant pockets and covers my bottom fully. Maybe it's also tucked in for the model's picture, but I expected it to stop closer to my belt, not 6-8"" past. It still works tucked in, I just didn't expect to have to do that. The arms are also long.<br /><br />Vneck - higher and tighter than expected. To get the deeper and wider vneck look in the model's picture, I feel like I would have to size up (then I would really swim in a L), or cut the collar off. Basically I think I'd need a S for length and a L-XL for the relaxed vneck look.<br /><br />Softness - Love the feel! Super comfortable and soft, light a comfy tee shirt.<br /><br />Overall it doesn't seem to be quite the same top I thought was coming, but an attempt to make it look like it? You certainly won't get the look in the model's fit in the picture without some sort of modification.<br /><br />However, since it's very soft, still flattering enough/workable, 3 of 5 stars.",0
2,"Ordered bracelet based on appearance in photo, wanted multi colored marble however bracelet was only 1 color",0
1,Quality was poor. It was broken when I got it.,0
5,Beautiful and classy gets lots of stares 🤗,1
5,The stitching and attention to detail are noticeable and appreciated. It was exactly the kind of quality I was looking for to proudly wear our flag.,1
2,"This outfit is to big. I bought a large.  It is cute, before I wear alterations will be needed.  The top part of the garment is not well made.",0
2,"After wearing these 5 or 6 times - indoors only - the stitching around the top of each one unraveled.  So now instead of seeing the 'furry part' at the top of each shoe, I see the foam sticking out.  Very disappointing.",0
5,Very good bar to work with. So many different options. Happy that I purchased it.,1
1,"Runs small had to return it, waiting on refund.",0
3,Dull color,0
5,Gorgeous comes in tiny packages !! These are the perfect size for a child or the upper area of an adult ear . Nose ring would also work for this. Super shiney and I love the straight edges !! Would buy in graduated sizes . 5✨‘s,1
5,"I've had these shoes for three months now and wouldn't trade them for anything.  I've had plantar fasciitis for a couple of years and had cortisone injections in both heels.  My doctor told me to stop going barefoot in the house (hardwood floors) so I started wearing rubber jandals inside.  It helped some but my left heel started getting sore again.  I did not want another shot.  I tried these slippers as a substitute for the jandals and the results have been great.  The soreness has faded away and I can walk normally again.  The comfort of these shoes can't be overstated.  It's like wearing superhero shoes.  Other reviews complain that the support fails, but that has not been my experience.  The wool lining does wear down pretty quickly but it hasn't affected the functionality or comfort of the shoes for me.  The only negative is that the wool tends to bind any debris that gets inside so you have to be careful to put only clean feet in them.  I am very cheap but these shoes are well worth the cost and I am now investing $100 in a pair of sneakers from this company.  If I ever return to the office, I'll buy a third pair that looks like dress shoes.",1
2,"Thought this is warm cloth, but it is not, and is large for the specific size so returned it.",0
4,"Favorite pair of glasses. I would use these as my riding glasses, especially for night time rides. Night time has bright greenish hue so you can see pretty good. Doesn't block wind very well but look great. Had these guys for months and held up, until my cousin sat on them. Buying my 2nd pair now.",1
5,I like it.,1
4,Watch looks nice but the brand packing Is horrible... Looks haggard.. I’m concerned the watch may also be damaged based on the look of the brand box.. We’ll see,1
4,A little cheap looking but still works when you want to wear a dressier watch.,1
4,They arrived 3days ahead of the expected arrival. Just how I expect it. There are so cute! 😍,1
3,"This has the same problems as most pushups. Pushes your boobs up too much without good support, so you just fall out of the bra every time you bend over. Also doesn't look completely natural, and not very comfortable. I'm always a 34C, but this is too small. Too tight and the loosest hooks. It is super cute though.",0
5,"I ordered these for a cheap pair of work boots but they are really good boots. I got the black. I work in them and wear them out. They're comfortable, they have a thick, good sole for kicking a shovel into the dirt. they get dirty and still look clean, repel water. My only wish is that the toe box was a bit wider, no one's feet are shaped the way most shoes are shaped but other than that they are good looking, well built and versatile.",1
5,"I much prefer real, all-leather belts, and it's very annoying when most belts I find are made of a cheaper vinyl-leather blend, stitched together in layers. These cheaper belts don't last long, but a real leather belt, taken care of, will last for a great many years.<br /><br />This belt is very nice. A good, thick strap of real leather, nicely prepared and stained. The buckle is attached to the belt via some good, stout stitching. The buckle itself is nicely done, with a simple design and an appealing finish. Very nice to look at, but nothing ostentatious. I think the belt will give many, many years of service if it's not abused (and probably if it is!).<br /><br />My only concern is the belt was a little wider than I'd prefer, but that probably has to do with the size. Unfortunately the belt I received was for a 38"" waist, which is much larger than mine, so I won't get to actually wear it! I donated it to a clothing drive at the high school.<br /><br />Here are some of the advantages of having a real, all-leather belt:<br /><br />* Durability is top-notch. I've had my all-leather daily-wearer belt for more years than I can remember, and it's outlasted all of the other belts that have been in my wardrobe since.<br />* They're a lot more comfortable than the vinyl-leather blend belts; more flexible and supple.<br />* When it starts looking worn you can re-stain it with leather dye, which brings it back to almost new-looking condition.<br />* If you have, or know someone who has, a set of punches you can cleanly add additional belt holes for better sizing.<br />* They smell better!",1
4,I bought these thinking about using them as fobs for my pocket watches.  I think they can work for that.  I would not use the small chain or the leather necklace on a bet.  Don't look good.,1
5,Love it,1
5,"It arrived with the time already set, luckily it still keeps time. It's very pretty and arrived without any damages.",1
1,I received this on Sunday and it was broken by Monday. I'm not hard on ankle bracelets as I have many on my ankle and they never break and I never lose them. This one was just made very poorly.,0
5,"Comfortable, soft, pretty, stretchy!",1
4,I’m really an XS but they don’t have that and the S is really a M so it doesn’t fit me but I gave it to my roommate!,1
1,The piercing was to small and some of them wouldn’t unscrew,0
5,"Solid, good quality pendant. I got one for myself and another one for a friend. It doesn't always lay flat because there is no bail, so when you lean forward and the pendant is hanging on the chain instead of against your skin, it is facing to the right instead of forward. This is okay with me. I prefer that there's no bail.<br /><br />Don't forget to make sure it's facing the right way each time you put it on!",1
4,"This is a nice skirt, i like it, i think that this should not be labeled as one size, but probably a small, the elastic band was realllllly tight around my natural waist, and my waist is about 29&#34; for those of you who want a reference.",1
3,I love the shirt but I ordered two sizes larger because of cotton shrinking and it’s a good thing because it just barely fits. Now I have to lay flat to dry after washing. Not pleased with this!!,0
5,"My son absolutely loves this Money Clip...he has taken it to Chicago to Cubs games, the state fair and a concert.  Feels much more secure and less bulky than carrying a wallet in your front pocket.",1
1,"very pretty earrings, way smaller than expected and SUPER tarnished. I don't know if they were a return or just crappy quality control but they are smudged and tarnished with something dark",0
1,"I liked the idea of the magnet. The magnet actually goes through the temples of the glasses so that the location of the magnets are potential breaking points. And, one of mine broke after 2 months. I do not handle the glasses around too much. I put it on when I get in my car. I then take them off after parking my car. Despite this very minimal handling, it broke. I included a picture of the glasses as used by the seller, and take note of the thickness of the material where the magnets are located.",0
4,They look great! They feel slightly cheap tho but for the price is good.,1
5,"These shoes are exactly what they look like, very shiny;  but they have some kind of smell like oil and you need to let them sit and air out because its really strong.  The fit was just a fraction big, but thats good, they slide on/off easily, such a great deal for the price.  Id recommend.  if you want nice looking dress shoes and dont want to spend $$, get these.  Some shoe person could possibly tell you more about the pros and cons, but I got what the photo showed.",1
2,"UPDATED REVIEW: (see below)<br /><br />Super light weight. My daughter loves them.<br /><br />I wanted something that wasn't pink for her but still girly. These aren't quite that as the color of the shoes themselves aren't as turquoise as I was hoping but we still like them and for $10, who can argue.<br /><br />UPDATE: my daughter has worn these maybe a handful of times and the stitching is already coming loose at the right foot toe.<br /><br />I had high hopes. So much so I ordered a larger pair but for $10 I suppose you get what you pay for.",0
4,Straps not made too well,1
3,My sister loves it! Its smaller than I thought and the chain it came on was kinda stupid. lol,0
3,"It’s not a sweatshirt, it’s a thin sweater. Color is nice and it’s soft just very thin.",0
5,Super cute.  Made the outfit perfect for my 80s party.  Wore earrings for hours without ears hurting or getting irritated,1
5,Was an absolute hit! Would definitely recommend for the My Little Pony lover.,1
5,I loved this bar.  I purchased one several years ago it was damaged in a storm so now I am looking to purchase a new one!,1
2,"Fit of the dress was fine but there was very obvious deodorant residue on the arm area of the dress. The A-line of the dress is also not as flared as the pictures advertise, even with a petticoat.",0
1,These shrink after you wash them.  Only got to wear them once before they were too short in the legs.,0
2,Nice soft material.. fits well... Not red. I ordered red for a family picture and this is not red,0
1,Very small.  More for a small child,0
5,love the ring,1
1,"Very disappointed in how it fit, the outfit fit way too big by the crouch area and the color is way off from what I was expecting.",0
3,Quality not as expected. After a single wash socks looks worn out,0
5,"True to size. Almost too short, had to pull dress down maybe one time while I was out. If you are taller than 5’11, probably wouldn’t recommend because of length.",1
2,I should have done my research before purchasing. I bought the Taurus constellation necklace and it isn't even the right one! I'm very disappointed now. What am I going to do with a necklace of a constellation that's not even mine?<br />The actual quality but of the necklace however seems nice. It is dainty and small.,0
1,"ZERO stars,the material was so thin you could see through it.I returned it immediately.",0
5,Me encanto estoy feliz con la compra,1
3,"The print and colors are great, held up to wash and dry. This looks like a sweat shirt in the pic, but it’s really just a thin long sleeve shirt. That aside, the pants are bigger than the shirt which is great for my kiddo who uses cloth/reusable diapers.",0
2,These run really small. Get about 3 sizes bigger,0
2,Stiff material.  Pattern is also not crisp and blurry/blow out looking.,0
2,Only two arrived in a ripped up bag,0
3,this was beautiful.  but it is VERY form fitting.  NOT TIGHT but it doesn't hid ANYTHING.,0
5,very nice watch,1
4,Good product,1
5,"I love these pants there are very comfortable, I wish I would have got a small instead of the medium but overall I love them. Wish they came in more colors. I have a promo so I got them at a great price and they came pretty quick.",1
2,"When I actually got the dress, it did not look anything like the picture-it was short sleeved lace with a tule skirt.  The zipper sucked but it was still a nice dress.  I'm lucky I still like it, but that was very dishonest of the company",0
5,I like to wear comfortable. I bought this item with top there were super comfy. I like to run with them.,1
5,"I bought these Calf Compression Sleeves because after being employed at a desk job for years, I recently found myself working at a new position where I was on my feet more. My calves and legs were in so much pain that I was headed down the path of painkillers and I did not want to go there. These compression sleeves have saved my life! I received them quickly and immediately put them on to sleep in them to see if they could reduce the pain I was experiencing. I woke up feeling great and immediately wore them for a full day at work. I have to say that my calves and legs feel so much better after a full 24 hours of wearing them. I am going to buy more! I ordered a size large because I have large calves and they fit me perfectly. I love these and highly recommend them for anyone who needs support and doesn't want to wear those ridiculously difficult compression socks. I wish I would have found them sooner but am so glad I have them now!",1
5,"I ordered these with very low expectations, but they’re literally GORGEOUS in person and they sent me another set of plugs also. Not sure if that was a mistake, but it was a nice surprise! Super cute.",1
4,"this was super cute, but the ends wouldn't stay tight so I constantly had to make sure they didn't fall off.",1
3,"My merchandise was resivida sastifactoriamente, I commend you for your attention responsavilidad and greeting.",0
5,Excellent for the price and receive rather quickly,1
5,Very warm and soft. The fleece keeps my ears warm.,1
5,"I love the material, it is really soft.",1
5,Very happy with this dress. Got true to size 8. Very low cut so it’s not modest. Straps are thin so if you have a large cup size it can cut a little on the shoulders. Material is thicker which makes this dress nice.,1
5,Cute and soft — my coworker chose this on her secret Santa wishlist and loved it when I gave  it to her!!,1
5,👍👍👍👍👍,1
4,"Good quality material for tie clip. However, the engraved initials are incredibly small. It is hard to make out individual letters (they are much smaller than what is pictured on the website). Otherwise, it looks nice!",1
5,Love this! So comfortable! I’m due to have my baby in 2 weeks and can barely tolerate sleeping in anything else at the moment. I’ve already rewashed it a handful of times and no issues besides the tiniest fraying on the lace part. Totally worth it for how super comfy this is.,1
2,Adorable but it broke the 1st time my daughter wore it. I would not recommend if you are doing anything active.,0
2,"I was disappointed.. I like the buckle, but the belt itself has no locking ratchets for the first 4 inches or so.<br />Not sure why.. another ratchet belt I bought had the locking things within 2 inches of the starting end.<br /><br />Basically it's very easy to cut this too short AND the overlap coming out it at least 5 inches rather than maybe 2-3 most of us prefer",0
2,Really not comfortable especially after surgery. Zipper not easy to close.,0
1,They do not stretch at all... could not even get them up past the ankle of an 7 year old. Complete waste of money. Find a different sock.,0
4,Kept me from throwing away my case after the original strap broke at the metal buckles.,1
3,loose fit through the hips and thighs. maybe nice for an elderly woman but not flattering on younger.,0
5,A good work watch.  I like the bigger face to read the time.  Only thing wrong is the band is a little small.,1
1,It is not silver.,0
2,Cheap boots they were not sturdy at all and kept falling off while walking. Threw them out after one week. Will not buy again.,0
5,"In U.S. sizing, I take a medium, but size Large in this item, could not be a more perfect fit. I was expecting the typical linen/cotton blend that I love, but the material has been treated, and my initial reaction was not a happy one. I then tried it on, and the drape and weight of the 2 garments i bought from Sellse is just...how shall I say... lovely! Comfortable, gorgeous and even wrinkle resistant. I couldn't be happier, and I am extremely picky! I wear the 2 dresses more than any other garments in my wardrobe. Well worth the price. Very satisfied, I am.",1
5,These are the glasses I loved in the early '90s. So happy I found them on Amazon. They are more fashionable than anything. They do help with the glare in the sun.,1
2,Cute design... NOT  THE COLORS IN THE DESCRIPTION.  I was expecting  typical Southwest Terra Cotta and Turquoise as shown in pictures... Do not be fooled! Actual necklace is lavender and faux turquoise.,0
4,It was very cute=),1
3,Nicely made but slightly smaller than I’d prefer,0
3,Much smaller than expected.,0
5,Metal head band. Fast shipping.,1
1,After using for less than a month one of the metal hooks that holds the strap on has broken. Otherwise it’s a good bag which I get tons of compliments on.,0
5,Great quality.  Very happy with my purchase.,1
3,"I wear a xl in all shirts. I ordered an xl in this shirt and the arms and chest area are way too tight. I’m in a 40 D.<br />But it is a super cute shirt. I’m hoping the xxl fits better.<br />Also I bought a black one exactly like it from the same company, same listing and it’s different material and fits great .",0
1,I tried several of these and they don't work. I&#34;m so glad I didn't count on these for goody bags for my sons birthday- dud,0
5,Excellent value. Looks great. I’m 5’ 4” and the length is perfect.,1
5,Arrived exactly as shown.,1
2,Not true to size.,0
2,Not happy with this purchase. Shipping took over a month. The quality of the dress was cheap. Runs small. Colors were pretty but just not a good dress. I ordered another dress similar to this one and received it in less than a week. The quality was way better.,0
2,Brought this for you 24 year old son. The hat was very large. It did not work form him.,0
5,Comfortable. Cute cut.,1
1,"I  first want to say that I have purchased several pairs of Blowfish shoes over the past few years and have been very happy with the fit and style of them. I have also recently purchased a pair of sneakers and love them as well, so I do not have anything bad to say about the brand.<br /><br />These shoes, on the other hand, have been the worst ones I have tried from the company. I wear a true size 9, and have been able to wear a size 9 in this brand. I even ordered this shoe in a size 9 and a size 10 just to be safe in case they ran smaller than usual, and both of them did not fit well.<br /><br />I have flat feet, that are not narrow or wide, and the footbed of this was not wide enough for my regular feet. I think that if you have an arch in your foot, this might work well for you, but if your feet are as flat as mine, I would skip these. The ankle strap is much to high on the foot - so when you walk, you get the flip flop foot burping sound which noone ever really wants. It also makes the strap more for show and not functional at keeping the shoe in place. The strap across the top of the foot was okay, but I feel like if I wore these for awhile, I would start to experience some rubbing and red marks.<br /><br />Sadly, both pairs are going back.",0
1,Didn’t have time. To do this before but not worth the price value is worth 5.00 not good,0
5,It’s really pretty and I love it. I believe it’s slightly smaller than regular size. But still fit.,1
1,Cheap and sheer material.,0
4,It was for my husband so I could only go by what he said.  He said he liked it. okay,1
5,I I love this bag it was well made I can't wait to wear it the color is so beautiful,1
2,The product says one size fits all and it doesn’t. I am a c cup and there was no stretch in the cups so it was way too small.,0
4,Nice after all,1
1,"I was excited when i received my first purchase of this bracelets there very pretty so i thought hmm let me order 2 more packages i was not thrilled when i received them...first bag u get all the colors u just dont get citrine u get hemetite instead ...2nd and 3rd bag u get 3 to 4 hemetites, 3 to 4 tigerseye...no rose quartz...no clear quartz...no abalone shell and one of my amethyst bracelets was put on a broken string...not fair at all company should tell customers that 2nd and 3rd bag will be thrown together what we decided to give u...😢",0
5,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. All day everyday between this and another hat I bought him recently! Great buy! Very simple!,1
5,Exactly as advertised.  Great product.,1
1,A total waste it fits kids size uughh,0
5,"A soon as I took this pack out of the box i was impressed with its build quality. The bag feels very well constructed and feels like it can actually handle being used. I'm sure we have all seen other ""tacticool"" bags that are just built like paper and with any bit of use the fall apart , well that's not this bag.<br /><br />Good,<br />lots of space and compartments<br />Waterproof lining looks thick and feels like the bag can actually get wet and not leak<br />grip on the back and inside the handle actually work and hold the bag to you<br />buckles feel solid<br />all zippers nice and smooth and don't bind up<br /><br />Bad,<br />Velcro on the back should have had an extra spot between the molle lines to hold patches better",1
5,Love the look!!,1
1,The rings are very ruff,0
5,"I’m 5’3”, 150 lbs and a large fit perfect!! Very soft, very comfortable!! This is my second pair! Highly recommend",1
4,I love the style and the color. You may want to consider getting a size smaller than what you are used to wearing.,1
2,"It would’ve been nice if the touchscreen feature worked as described. However, it does not. The gloves are warm and I like the style but I don’t like being deceived. Therefore, I am only giving two stars in this review.",0
3,its good. but S is too large for me,0
3,I really like the toe rings themselves until I tried to put them on and multiples just broke in half,0
1,"Uncomfortable, and the bifocal is off center and barely there.  Couldn’t use, switched to foster grant",0
5,Super cute!!!,1
2,"It looks really small, i purchased 8.5 to 9.0 mm, and i think you might have shipped 7.0 mm.  I need to it get checked at the local jewelry store i suppose",0
5,"I love these kind of necklaces: long, pretty, and unique! I saw the same necklace on another website and it was like an extra $2 to this price.",1
1,They were not white. I expected white but they have colored flowers on them. I have yet to open them because I didn't want colored flowers.,0
5,It's beautiful! The fit is great too,1
1,Way too small now just hanging in my closet,0
5,"Really impressed with this mask! It moves a lot of air & the battery lasts all day! I work 8-9 hour shifts. It’s just hard to talk, but other than that it’s awesome!",1
4,"Nice little outfit for a baby. My 9mo looks super cute in these. I like the camo shorts more than the shirt saying ""Little Man""  - that might have been better to just leave plain with no words on it, but together it's a cute outfit and fits him as expected. Not the best quality but not bad at all, especially since kids this age grow out of everything so fast. Will get good use out of this.",1
2,"I bought one of these for my sister who was dying horribly, and in excruciating pain.  And, no, I wasn't being ironic in the sense that the cancer was clearly winning and the pendant talks about &#34;not failing&#34; (which she obviously was...you know, dying and all).  Well at the very least I thought that if she were wearing this when she met St. Peter, it might buy her a little influence getting in.  It didn't work.  She still went to Hell.  For the record, my sister was an awful human being UNTIL she got cancer, so maybe that had something to do with it.",0
3,"The necklace looks really nice until you see where the clasps is. The is a cheap looking extended chain on the back so it makes the necklace look super cheap. If I oils have know this, I wouldn’t have bought it.",0
3,Item was to big so i ended up keeping lets be honest who returns underwear,0
2,"The bra performed as expected (good for yoga, but not enough support for high-impact/cardio workouts), but the straps were, unfortunately, a deal-breaker for me - they never lay flat and are made of a rather itchy material that irritated my skin.",0
3,I love the print on this dress and it fits ok - the top is a bit large,0
5,Product was exactly as described.  Good quality.  Great price.,1
5,"Bought this beanie for my 13 yr old grandson for Christmas.  The colors are vivid, (black and red) and he was quite thrilled.",1
3,"The product pilled the first time I wore it.  And, all I was doing was sitting.  Also, very hard (almost impossible) to get a small stain out.  It is quite cute.",0
5,Good,1
4,It is SO cute.. but its also WAY tinier in real life. It an barely fit a couple cards...but it is vert cute.,1
5,WORKED OUT WELL,1
4,"A little more snug than expected, but overall just absolutely gorgeous! It was perfect!",1
5,I absolutely love these! I have a problem w post clutch earrings! These threaders are so easy for me to put into my holes! I would like to purchase more!🥰,1
4,Loved it it was has sought on the picture and describe just way too small at least go up to size is,1
3,Cute but it came with a huge hole in the back :/,0
2,I bought this twice. The main charm fell off both times. Poorly made.,0
5,"I absolutely love this necklace!!! I got it for myself because I wanted just a cute, simple piece to wear daily. It’s dainty and perfect and exactly what I was looking for!",1
4,"Somewhat small for a size large...however they ate spandex and they do stretch...however they did shrink when I placed them in the dryer. .but for a 65 year old, spandex (tight fit) is now the material used for clothing.... But I do like the style...",1
2,Amethyst stone I received looks black in color and not at all in the purple/lavender color expected. Disappointed.  The green stone I received is very nice and I gifted it,0
1,"I ordered a size up based on some reviews of it being see through, hoping to counteract it, but nope. If you have any curve to your breasts or stomach, the fabric is going to pull and turn white and see through. The fabric was super soft but a little clingy so I'm super sad about this.  It also fits awkward now since I sized up on top of it being see through. It would be okay if I was ordering it as a costume, but I panned on it being a frequent wear dress. I guess I shouldn't be so sad for only paying $20 but I could have found a higher quality dress on clearance or something for $20.",0
1,Size doesn't match,0
5,I love the simple style. Easy to wear and fits perfectly.,1
5,My Dad just loves this belt. He is a heavy man and other belts were breaking just after a few uses. This belt is premium leather and soft. We will buy more in other colours.,1
5,I love Asymmetrical types of shirts. This shirt has a very pretty design and the ruffle hem had me blown away. The shirts material is sheer and fits perfectly. The provides a stretch as well. The back has a keyhole button at the top in the back.,1
5,the best,1
3,"I received this as a gift and absolutely LOVED it. It does run a tad small, but I was prepared when I put it on my wishlist and put in for a size larger. The tshirt quality is very nice. Not cheap and thin, I was actually amazed at how nice it was. The lettering and saying , I felt as a teacher, were perfect for my job.<br />I washed it 1 time in cold.  Dried it on medium and when I just now removed it from the dryer the letters are all peeling off. I am actually a lot more sad about this than I would expect to be over a tshirt. I just really loved this shirt. The fabric, the fit, the look. I had planned on buying more in a variety of colors, now I am hesitant.<br />*order replacement and item has stretched out neckline and letters don't seem securely applied to shirt.",0
3,Color not as vibrant in person,0
5,LOVE it,1
2,"Floppier than expected and not my style. I am pretty picky with hats though. I loved the color and the feature that allows you to adjust it to your head.<br /><br />Update: Even though I am not a fan of this hat, you might be. All I have to say is I received an email today from this company that inquired about my review and I think that is pretty great. I will still return it, but it is nice to know that they back their product and aim to make their customers happy. Five stars for customer service, but based off the definition of each star I still have to give it a 2.",0
4,Nice earrings.,1
1,"Poor quality, stinky. Absolutely different what you see on photo. Do not recommend to one one buy from this seller. I have a problem to return it back.",0
4,"I love the fitted style, they stay put! Maybe I have a big face, or my ears are too far back (😆), but I had to remove the elastic sliders, and the elastic is still just a tad tight.  But definitely not a problem.  The Tshirt jersey knit is so comfortable.  The pocket for filters appears to be very well placed.  The pocket on previous Tshirt jersey knit masks would slide into my mouth when talking, but so far, so good with this one.  I will be recommending these!",1
1,This product did not last 2 weeks before getting a hole in it. Poor quality.,0
2,Cute shirt but fits much looser than the dark stripe version. (See photos for comparison.) the torso was baggier and the sleeves looser. Will be returning.,0
3,Initially this dress was great for a Halloween costume but the fabric is now shredding and tearing apart just from normal kids play.,0
5,"Use it at work to not get lunch food on my uniform  😂. Love it, cause i got it to match my work shirt. People laughed, but i was the only one without a food or spilled coffee/drink stain on my shirt. So HA! Also easy to wash.",1
1,Very small,0
2,I was looking for a large chunky sweater and this came up. It is not that. It's see through like most other womens' clothing. The Medium was supposed to be large enough from other reviews however it was too small. The fabric was very soft though.,0
3,A 8mm lava stone will not fit it.,0
1,I ordered easy on copper fit six. The Sox I received are very hard to put on and the soles are a woven aluminum no copper at all.,0
5,Great deal.  Use them in all sorts of projects,1
3,"It hits about 2 inches below the knee, I got a large and I’m 5”6",0
5,Love the fabric. Super soft.  Washes very well. Color as displayed.,1
2,Looks cool but starts to tarnish and smell like costume jewelry relatively soon,0
2,"I don't know if the mask is good, I'll be returning it because it came in a plastic bag, with holes, no box, thats not safe",0
4,"Overall this is a nice pajama set for the price. It doesn't trap sweat (although not quite as breathable as cotton or bamboo), the teal color is gorgeous, it looks more luxurious than it is. I am 5'3"" and 38-33-38 - I ordered this in medium and it fits fine on the shorts, which can comfortably stretch out to about 40 inches, so I maybe could have got a small instead because the top is on the too big side (but it's sleepwear/loungewear so it's ok to be baggy).<br /><br />The thread used in this is a little scratchy, so that's a bit annoying. And I would have liked pockets. Also the shorts are bit longer than I would have liked & a little different from the listing pictures. The fabric is relatively thick and seems sturdy, definitely no issues with see-through. The fabric itself does not stretch at all.<br /><br />The packaging wrinkles didn't come out in the wash so I guess I'll need to iron this at some point, but it doesn't develop new ones easily. Recommend to wash on cold with fabric softener & hang dry.",1
5,My granddaughter has worn these since I gave them to her at Christmas.  The screw on backing are great.,1
5,Comfortable<br />Fashionable<br />Warm,1
1,Extremely small. I had a hard time a very hard time putting it on. I am going to return this bracelet!,0
4,I bought the case for my subscription sunglasses.  I was tired of carrying a hard case for my regular eyeglasses and for the sunglasses.  There is no where to carry them.  I can clip the case onto a belt loop and keep either pair in the hanger case and exchange them as needed.  It came in handy on a recent cruise and there is actually room enough to carry both pair of glasses if I don't feel like wearing either pair. The glasses are safe and out of the way.  Great Idea.,1
5,Beautiful and not heavy on ear.,1
5,"Had to prepare in advance for major surgery recovery and needed something that would be loose, comfortable and keep my arms and body warm while not overheating. This was an excellent selection! Met every checklist iyem needed and liked it so much, I'll be keeping it. Currently at 5'5 and 180 and a size small fit perfectly, loose but not baggy. Looking forward to slimming down and the design will still be flattering and not look like a tent.",1
3,The picture is very inaccurate. I ordered this for my 9 year old and it didn’t fit at all nor did the brim look like what was advertised. I’m returning unfortunately because it’s way too small and it was misshaped. I gave 3 stars because it is a super cute hat.,0
3,"These have a shorter inseam than other GV Amanda pants.  The waist, despite being elastic, runs a little big, which causes the pants to ride lower than expected on my hips.  This offsets or partially offsets the inseam being too sort.",0
5,"My daughter loves these! They are cute, comfortable and fit her feet just fine! Who doesn't love striped cat socks?",1
1,Had trouble opening the pin. A little disappointed in the product. Would not recommend.,0
5,Very cuuute,1
5,nice,1
5,What amazing masks. The greatest single item I have ever bought on amazon,1
5,Someone asked me to buy this for her and she loves it.,1
2,It was thin.  Fit as Expected.,0
5,"I had a totally different experience from a lot of reviewers.  I ordered the 40 piece pack, and received ten sets of four, each set (red, blue, white, green) packaged on the cardboard hand display.  And every single light worked.  I opened all the sets - using the red/white lights for Halloween costumes - and they all worked.  Not one dud in the whole set.  I have nothing but positive things to say about 40 working lights for under $7, including free prime delivery!",1
3,Little saggy not great for the average women's neck but would still buy again,0
5,shipping was fast and they look great...I bought them a size big so my son can grow into them,1
5,Loving beautiful,1
5,Great Price and Good Quality!,1
5,Awesome glasses definitely will buy another pair fast delivery also,1
1,No Se parese en nada y  se rompio. Pronto,0
3,"Too short to be worn alone, but cute with leggings. I'll still wear it for sure.  Fits nicely everywhere else.",0
3,too Small and did not like the material that much but the design is nice.,0
5,Love it,1
1,It’s not what I expected I would not advise To buy they look different on picture’s and reality. They don’t do returns on top .,0
1,Pads slide while riding. Very disappointed,0
5,Niceee,1
5,"Sooo cute, look like a little starwberry. Small size is fit for 2 year old girl.",1
5,"Love how this dress fits, however it's a bit tight around the neck but not too much. Would have liked it if it was just a little loose. The length is perfect and the material is nice and soft.",1
2,"This isn't even worth a dollar. Came pre-tarnished, nearly as much black as silver color. I was expecting top quality, but this is not as pictured.",0
1,"The socks were way too big and the grips on the bottom were sliding around. I constantly had to readjust the socks during my Pilates class, which is disrupted because I’m not paying attention to the instructor and missing the exercise cues. And also it’s dangerous when putting your feet/heels on the footbar or using a jump board and you don’t have the right amount of protection that the socks are supposed to provide.",0
1,The thigh openings won’t stretch as much as the rest of the panties so they won’t fit  I tried ordering another size up and still the same problem. They would be great if this was fixed,0
3,"I tried this on the day I got it and it was so cute but the neck is detaching from the body part. I hope that when I wear it, it doesn't detach 100%.",0
4,Felt a lil bigger than other size 16 I’ve got from same seller,1
5,"Love this tote! I leave it in my car for grocery runs. Super sturdy and holds lots of groceries. I love the yellow color, looks better in person than in the photos. Will buy the rest of the colors to keep in my car.",1
5,Super soft! I ordered a medium but I would've gotten a small. A great 4th of July shirt if you want something different.,1
5,"Gorgeous chiffon, exactly what I wanted!",1
3,"I am 5'10 and about 150 pounds i ordered the large and they are the perfect tightness, but they are about 4 inches too short so i have to roll them up so they don't look nerdy. Besides that though they are pretty nice!",0
2,Khaki plain?  Try diarrhea brown.,0
1,They are to flimsy. They won’t stay on my face. Not sturdy.,0
2,I hate the material! Cheap fabric.,0
2,It's not compressed at all. Too loose like normal tank top.,0
1,It sits funny on my body. It is definitely made for someone with a very long torso. I'm sending this back as soon as possible.,0
1,Read the reviews I ordered an xs because I am normally a small and this fits like a potato sack.,0
4,BUY THE NEXT SIZE UP! The description says to buy a larger size which I ignored. It definitely runs a little small. I'm 5'10 180lbs...a large was just a little snug in the chest and armpits. Overall a great jacket. Green color is accurate with the photo. Zipped pockets work well plus it has two inside. It's lightweight but has some insulation for the cold windy days. You can't beat it for the price...pick one up!,1
1,"Nice shirt, really loved it! Ruined by the fake diamonds on the collar. I thought I could just cut them off but they are sewn in through the collar and into the shirt. Too bad, definitely returning.",0
4,"Beautiful add-on collar!<br /><br />I purchased the round collar style because it lays flat and is a lot more comfortable.<br /><br />The fabric is very soft. It's simple enough for everyday wear, but elegant enough for better occasions.<br /><br />I did take off one star because it's not stark white. It's slightly &#34;off&#34; white, so take that into consideration.",1
4,Cute shirt,1
5,"I purchased the bracelet at the advice of a Medium (yeah, who knew?) and she recommended rose quartz for its healing properties.  So, I bought this one and the small lava rock stones that interspace are just lovely.  I even forget to take it off when I go to sleep.",1
1,Extremely small. Bad quality,0
5,Love it!,1
5,"This wrap skirt is really unique - the color and pattern are gorgeous and looks very classy with a black tank or tee.  It dresses up if you wear black lace and a pashmina around the shoulder.  It dresses down with a black swim suit.  I was really not sure whether or not I'd like the colors but boy, are they great!",1
3,For the cost it was ok.,0
1,Pretty style but size up,0
3,Thought it was Cotton but its polyester. Not a fan of that but it does fit well. It will take a month to get here from china,0
2,"Advertised as pink, but it’s actually an ugly orange 😐",0
3,"The shirt itself is cute, it sits oddly and sort of makes me look like a potato sack, no shape whatsoever. It's good to throw on for the grocery store but wouldn't wear it out for the night.",0
1,"The sleeves are short. They ride up, and they do not breathe. These make me feel sticky and I hate them. They are the cheapest thinnest shirts I’ve ever owned. I would advise anyone not to buy them, maybe for half the price, for emergency clothing. I usually wear them as a base layer, and they are already my least favorite pieces which I will be tossing out when the weather warms up and buying better quality pieces before next fall.",0
3,"It was a bit smaller then I thought. The straps we're also tight and small.. Over all it was made will, great fabric.",0
4,"These have been great with one glaring exception. While sledding, snowball fighting, and general snow fun, the nose peice fell out. I didn't notice it until the end of the day. I like the different lenses and all but they are sort of pointless if you have to glue the nose peice in-order to not lose the thing. The company was great and sent a replacement pair.",1
5,"Yes, the gloves do work on smartphone touch screens! My favorite thing about these gloves though is how thin they are, which allow me to bend my fingers. I personally don't like thick, thick gloves that make my hands feel like they're suffocating and unable to move or hold doors open. I've worn them outside to bear NYC's harsh winter conditions and they get the job done!",1
1,Ordered this bag for a trip to cancun... bag itself is great but the straps are garbage. They kept getting tangled and are super uncomfortable. I ordered this &#34;wide strap&#34; design to be more ergonomic but ended up being more uncomfortable than expected.,0
5,This watch band was easy to put on.  The links are very easy to remove or replace to adjust the length.  Perfect watch band for my Samsung watch.  Looks and feels like an expensive band at a great price.,1
2,"After two washes and two wears the elasticity on the top half of the dress was ruined. It was a beautiful dress to wear but I wish the quality of the elastic was better. If you just want this dress for one wear, absolutely get it but I am not happy that i already have to throw it away. To me, wasn't worth it.",0
5,Love! They fit perfect and are so comfortable!,1
5,Looks very boho and fits comfy. I bought a size up after reading reviews and because I like loose fitting clothes.,1
5,Loved it,1
5,Keeps my arms cool throughout the day since I work at a golf course.,1
1,Very disappointed... item is just what I was looking for however there price tag on the item said $1.99 but I paid $11 for the item total rip off.,0
5,Don't be fat with meat on neck...you won't look right in it,1
5,really cute. its the perfect size for a cross body- not too big or small. holds essentials plus a quite a few extras. love the shearling lining inside- so cute and fuzzy. I'm an UGG fan. got the tan- it goes with all my UGG boots and everything,1
4,The cover up is soft & air flows through it.,1
5,"Arrived on time, easy to adjust, looks good and definitely worth the price!",1
3,I had bought several skull caps from local leather shop and they were nice thick leather. The local leather shop closed so I found this on here and thought it looked like what I had purchased in the past but upon receiving it I saw that it was much much thiner leather than what I had purchased from local leather shop. When I put it on after a few miles of riding the thin leather stretches due to it be thin leather and the cap will try to come off with the wind. From now on I will only buy from a leather shop where I can feel the thickness of the leather first hand.,0
1,To large for me,0
4,My granddaughter loved this,1
5,Ok,1
5,It’s very comfortable and fits good . A great price for good quality band.,1
5,"This is my go-to belt for the foreseeable future. Sleek and slips into any belt loop size, and matches with everything. Easy to adjust.",1
5,"I love it !!! It’s bigger than I thought, I should’ve gotten a small buy I ordered a medium. But I love the over size look so it worked out for me. Extremely well made as well !!!<br />100% buying another !!!",1
3,Broke before I finish putting it on,0
5,I actually do like them.  I added to my other sterling silver bracelets and they look so good together.,1
2,Way to big i needed a small i got a med,0
5,Fabulous size & color!,1
1,"The material is PAPER THIN and SEE THROUGH. These are the opposite of flattering. I was hoping to have them as lounge pants in the summer. Instead they are now pajamas that no one is allowed to see me in, except for my husband. they are very thin, so any spandex they might have don't hold anything in. These will be great for someone that is really thin.  if you have some thickness to your legs/hips/tummy, you'll will see every little ripple. Which is too bad- the lace at the bottom is pretty.",0
3,"While these are comfortable, they dont stay up.  I find that I need to pull them up every 2-3 hours.",0
4,"Wonderful, love the color and the product.",1
5,"Very comfortable, fit as expected, great price for the blue pants. Will look for bigger size next summer, hope the price will not change",1
2,closure is hard to work. Stars are too small,0
3,It’s ok. Not great but the reason for 3 stars is that the color is nowhere near dark pink which is what it’s supposed to be. Should know better when product comes from China.,0
2,"The green was brighter, more of a kelly green. Chiffon always means slick polyester in my experience. I forgot.  I don't like wearing the material.  The sizing was just wearable but I ordered larger than I am because I like larger.... so order accordingly. The style is as cute as it appears.",0
1,Pretty fabric but not secured shut. Felt like a shawl.,0
1,I no idea what it is,0
2,"The material was cheaper than they made it look in the picture, there has to be differing qualities of chiffon bc the one i recieved was of a cheaper quality. Not happy",0
4,Bought these for Halloween & just what I was looking for. Plus it fits my personality so I wear them anyways just because I can. Luv them & the price.,1
5,I will enjoy the warmth that this coat affords.,1
5,"Very beautiful and met my expectation , worth the price.",1
4,I like it,1
5,great.....,1
2,"material is good quality.  shorts are too small, shirt is too big",0
5,Best sunglasses I ever purchased. Great coverage. UV at best.,1
5,"I looooove love love these leggings! They're so soft and comfortable. I am normally a size 4 and I always wear a small. originally, I ordered a small, but they were way too tight. So, before returning them, I ordered an M to compare. The size M was much better. I kept the medium and returned the small one.",1
5,Great product,1
5,"Super cute Giraffe design. Nice, soft material. I love it, it’s so comfy.",1
2,"No photo size description, covers did not pop out and photos were hard to insert causing scratches to them. Chain immediately was tangled. Nice looking, but not great.",0
2,"Nice shorts but Way too small.  My daughter wears a small, we ordered a medium and still way too small.",0
5,Fit really well. Good material.  POCKETS!!!!!,1
2,I have to return them they are huge.  I am a size 8 normally.  I ordered a medium and they are massive on me.  I will return them.,0
5,They are so cute and great for the price. I really love the white and the green! Must buy people!,1
2,Not real gold turned black after long term wear,0
2,Might have been cute it it wasn’t huge...I’m a small in normal brands but the small in this for like a large.,0
2,"This shapewear top is a noel idea, but it is cut way too small. The small sizing should be indicated so  customers can adjust their accordingly.",0
1,"Two arrived broke, ordered clear and received purple.",0
5,Seriously so impressed with this suit. I bought it just for the rash guard and the whole thing is too cute not to wear,1
2,"I really like the look of the dress,  but question  the measurements.  It runs  extremely small and doesn't leave room for breasts.  I will return it, if it doesn't fit my much smaller daughter.",0
4,"Great hat, looks just like it does in the picture and fits well. I got the blue one but I'll probably get the black one as well. The only problem is that it's not a sturdy hat. I wore it while camping and it brushed against a tree limb and I thought nothing of it but it put a decent size hole in it. For just casual wear it's amazing but nothing other than that. Soft and warm on the inside.",1
4,Great product for the cost,1
1,"No queda bien, las mangas no caen y la falda muy larga ajusta en la cintura",0
5,very cute,1
1,It turned yellow in 1 week,0
1,"Very disappointed. Apparently, to this manufacturer a size 14 is extra- large. PJs made way too small.",0
2,It is not true to size I wear a large  ordered a xxlarge in this dress and I couyeven get in it,0
5,Beautiful!!!!,1
5,Simply royal,1
3,"It did not fit snuggly on my 12 year old son, so I figured I'd just take it. It's doesn't fit me well either. It's just...floppy ...and shifts around, especially with stiff in it.<br />Also, it's ""Splash resistant"" at best.",0
5,"snug fit, just right around shoulders, seems to keep shape after a few washings already.",1
3,"I really only needed a pair of clear wide lenses for riding in the early mornings and evenings so I got these. Taking it out of the case,  it felt super cheap.  Like dollar store toy plastic kinda cheap. Tried them on and they look good, but fit loose.  They should add another size nose piece.<br />Went to switch lenses and the top piece is a PITA. I put the clear lens in and it works fine. If they last the winter,  I'll be impressed.  Ultimately,  I've spent more $ on worse things. #shrug",0
5,warm and nice,1
1,"Utilizó talla M, cuando me vino el producto no me quedaba y lo regrese, pedí talla S y tampoco me quedo",0
3,"Took forever to arrive. Cute shirt. Not what I expected. Its not like the picture AT ALL. Even the description is misleading, it isnt a v neck. I guess I should have known the description wasnt accurate since its a tank top and a v neck tee all in one. lol.  It's not even the type of shirt that would fit like the picture suggests. Its more like the pic I attached (Not the actual shirt but very similar fit). I still like it but only because it's see through. I can see my fingers!! I wasn't expecting that but I'll take it.",0
5,"Lightweight, stretchy and non slip. Wasn’t crazy about the color but they do their job. Launder well too.",1
1,This dress is made of very cheap material. It was basically a nude slip with black lace and mesh over it. It looked more like lingerie. I wouldn't be caught dead wearing this in public. I returned it.,0
2,"Update: I've been buying these for years, but noticed the quality has gone down a lot!! I just bought some barely two months ago, and there are holes already!! Not sure what happened with the quality, but not happy at all!!!<br /><br />Love these shorts for bumming around the house. Comfortable and nice long length!",0
2,This is my second dress from this company.  The dresses are smaller then what is advertised.  I probably will not order dresses from Lunajany.,0
5,"I love this coat, just ordered a 2xl and sending 3xl back its to big on the sides, bust area was fine .I love the feel of the jacket, and the pockets is the same material of the inside hood area, it feels soooooo soft. Excellent purchase!!! I weigh 235lbs and bust 46dd...perfect fit",1
1,"I ordered this thinking I was ordering a full dress & when it came, it was only the skirt. I'm very disappointed.",0
5,Great socks for those that need good gripping on floors to prevent falls.,1
1,Did not pay attention to the details and only looked at the pics. It’s not cotton and lace but a printed nylon. Not at all what we thought this would be.,0
5,"I like the material, it’s super comfy. The color/fit  is flattering. I sized up to an XL for an oversized look.",1
5,"Ok so not going to lie when I took it out the bag I was like wtf!! This was made so wrong but my curiousness got the beat of me so I tried it on. The material was thin but had a little stretch to it ... ok, let’s see what happens. I put the dress on and it goes over just fine and hits in the the right spots. The neck zips pefectly and it’s comfortable , I bought the white with black polka dots it’s a slightly see through but I always layers under dresses. I actually liked it so much I bought 4 more in different colors. So for a cheap costume look to actually going out dresses this is great for the price.",1
3,Still trying to make up mind about dress.,0
5,"These shoes are so stylish, comfortable and light weight. They do run a little small I got a half size bigger and they fit perfect. Definitely would buy again.",1
5,Love these earrings. where them almost everyday,1
5,"Love love this top, Reminds me of Jin for BTS.",1
2,Thin and one of the flags has 5 stars. There are only 4 stars on Chicago flag. Oops,0
5,They run small so get the next size up. bought them for my hubby. Fit him like a glove. He loves the texture and fit.,1
5,Love these leggings.  Very flattering and fit perfectly.,1
1,Tapers down  gets verry skinny compared to the factory 20mm band on my 44mm Samsung active 2 uses a 20mm band. Felt cheesy and the pin has a deathgrip on the band where it feels it's going to rip when you remove it. I went back to the OEM band after about 5 minutes.  If you prefer more the women's style skinny bands you might like it but I prefer the ones that don't taper and stay 20mm all the way across.<br />Ohh and lastly the pins aren't set in place so it makes putting it on alot harder than the OEM bands.,0
1,Way too small. Must have been made in China.,0
5,Love this dress! Very comfortable and I love that it also has pockets!! Super handy. Highly recommend this adorable dress.<br />- Laura,1
2,"picture gives impression of pockets on the hips, more like from the thigh. They are very long in the end and need atleast a 6 inch turn-up to get them above the ankle.  Material a little thinner than expected.  They ae quite tight around the legs, unless you have very skinny legs!!",0
5,It fits perfect,1
1,The material is way too thin for what we’be expected.,0
5,I needed bifocal sunglasses so I did not have to change glasses every time I needed to read something.  The VVDQELLA sunglasses are attractive and they cover my eyes very well.  The lenses are very comforting to my eyes in the bright sun because I have very sensitive eyes. The frame is also quite comfortable. I am very pleased with these sunglasses and the price was excellent.,1
3,"This is a nice large bag best suited for camping or short hikes.  The product I received matched the description.....it has:<br />•  Adjustable, padded and wrapped with breathable mesh, the perforated foam shoulder straps enhance air circulation  - straps could use some extra padding<br />•  Hip belt webbing system cinches with a natural pulling motion for quick, precise adjustments – nice feature that made adjustments very easy<br />•  Front mesh pocket is perfect for quickly stashing away few small items for easy access<br />•  Plushy hip belt that's comfortable to your hip<br />•  Quick clip tool loops that hold an ice axe or trekking poles<br />•  High quality durable zippers ensure smooth and secure operation<br />•  Two large zippered side pockets to store frequently used essentials<br />•  Twin side mesh pockets for water bottles<br />•  Build-in rainfly keeps moisture away from your pack<br /><br />4 Elements that could be improved –<br />While the quality fits for this price range, any extra padding on the shoulder straps and hip pads would go a long way towards improving the comfort of the bag.  When I loaded the bag with 30 pounds of gear and went for a 4 mile hike the straps compressed a great deal and you can really feel the weight on your shoulders.<br />The bag does have an opening for a water system but the bladder would just sit among all of your other gear.  A separate pouch would help keep the bladder in place when you are going through your bag to get out your gear.<br />The divider in the bag is nice but it has two big openings on the left and right side of the bag.  I was able to put my hand through both sides.  It is great to have two sections for the bag but what is the point if your smaller gear can always slide down to the bottom and fall out when you open the bottom to get the items you are attempting to keep separate.<br />A pocket or two on the hip pads would be very convenient to keep items you did not want to stop and take off the bag to get at.<br />All in all, a nice bag that is priced to match its value.<br /><br />I received this pack at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own and I have in no way been paid for a good review. My review, my opinion and my experiences are honest and completely genuine. I take writing reviews seriously.

1,"They don't even open, 100% wouldn't trust to put them in id they did open after the struggle.",0
5,I was a little hesitant in buying this cause I am and big guy and didn't know if the would fit. But I was surprised when they came in the mail. It fits perfectly without squeezing my wrist and very durable. I recommend this for people with big wrists,1
1,"Zero stars. These arrived with one arm completely bent, AND they feel incredibly cheap even if they weren't defective. Don't waste your time.",0
4,I love these! I have ordered 4 pairs. Would give it a 5 star except that one pair was smaller than the rest. I actually WISH they provided a slightly smaller size. They are roomy and comfortable!,1
1,Shorter than I thought and very thin.  Sending it back,0
1,The quality is very poor and fits very small.  when I went to exchange the seller has no returns policy which it wasn’t clear when purchased. Very disappointed,0
4,Good,1
5,"I love love love my necklace, the picture doesn't do its justice. The packaging is more then adorable too. Ready for a gift",1
4,Great pants for laying around in. Not as breathable as I thought they would be though.,1
1,Broke with a week of buying. Very cheaply made,0
1,"UPDATE:  Seller contacted me about the poor review.  They apologized, refunded the full purchase price and did not require me to return It.<br /><br />It is supposed to look like an optical illusion of deep holes. It just looks like spots.",0
3,"The blue wrap had a hole in it -- not a problem for my purposes, but shows lax quality control.",0
5,They fit just right and are comfortable,1
3,This cap was disappointing for what they charge.  Not the best Quality.  It fits a little small for average size man.  The symbol is NOT embroidered.  It’s a patch sewn on label. Not exactly what I expected.,0
4,It's kind of bright I feel like I standout when I where it.,1
1,nothing like the picture.poor quality and the color is red instead of burgendy,0
5,Charlie dog has proudly celebrated pride month in this dashing tie for two years now.,1
5,Very nice. Soft and comfortable.,1
5,I like these,1
4,So cute and my child seems to love them.,1
5,Nice,1
5,Puts class with style,1
5,"I have given this to somebody as a gift and she was VERY pleased , she liked it a lot , great packaging , fit as expected and nice attention to detail....Recomend it !!",1
4,gets tangled easily,1
1,Don’t waste your money! Split part the first time I put it on and now it doesn’t want to stay on. What a ripoff!,0
1,"I was drawn to this one because of the design, but it's not worth it. Most hats like this have some sort of padding to keep it square, but not this one. It just falls flat like a regular egg-shaped hat. I tried to return it but my return wasn't acknowledged and was simply advised to let the hat &#34;air out&#34;. The shipping is $5 anyway so it's probably not even worth the hassle. Flimsy material, no the shape, bad service. It's one of those cheap Chinese product scams where the picture looks much better than it actually is, so I'm not surprised.",0
4,Cute and adorable,1
5,I love these pants!  They are super comfy and perfect for the spring/summer weather.  The pattern is gorgeous too.,1
1,Bad writing on description! Sent wrong size. And quality was poor anyway. After holding a pair in my hands I realized I didn’t want these anyway,0
1,Shame on me for not looking at the product when I arrived rather than waiting on the cooler weather.  I pulled the sweatshirt out of the package and it is stained.  Obviously a return that was just sent back out.  Very disappointed.,0
2,Ran way too small 2xl more like an Tight Xl,0
3,The fabric is not great quality and shorter than it appears but fit is good.,0
1,Shoes are cute but they run small. My daughter couldn't wear them.,0
3,"It is much smaller than  I expected.  I can't think in terms of  mm and cm.  I have  to squeeze it too tightly on my ear for it to stay  on, and I am afraid  that it might break.",0
5,"My daughter loves it, it’s soft and colorful and fits perfectly",1
2,Cute but differently not OVERSIZED as stated in description. They look as if they are for a child. Will not be ordering anymore from seller.,0
4,"I found this by accident while searching for traditional hair cutting capes and I'm glad I did! Cleaning up after my daughter's first real hair cut was easy and kept hair off the floor. I recommend acclimating your child to this to make sure they can tolerate it. The last thing you need is an upset child flailing around while you're trying to cut and getting hair all over the place! Luckily for us, my 2 year old loved having it on and would run around with it on, and tolerated it during the haircut. The only tough thing was the length I wanted to cut to was kind of right where the cape was around her neck, so I couldn't get as close as I wanted to the area. I could see this being an issue for really long hair as well, as it might bunch up at the bottom. I think this is better suited for short hair where all the cutting would happen well above where the hair gets collected. Overall I'm happy with my purchase but will get a traditional cape as a backup.",1
5,second pair and quality is great! overall a great slip on and color is much more vibrant than seen here. Kids love them!,1
5,Bought for use while losing weight. Able to take the slack out of too big waist.,1
1,Came in very poor condition,0
2,"Cheap, yellow colored &#34;gold&#34; looks garish even for costume jewelry.",0
3,"I'm 5'11 and 180lbs they fit great the material is very swishy (loud) and there's 1 little pocket inside, I was expecting outside pockets",0
5,I love this ring!  It truly looks like the real thing it has so much sparkle and shine!!,1
5,This is a great watch.  I love having it solar powered so that I don't spend so much $$ on watch batteries.  I love the multiple functions.  It's a great little wrist computer.  Don't lose the manual like I did!,1
2,Good fit good quality so surprised,0
1,I overpaid for these. They are soft silicone and nothing like the original nose pads on my Oakley glasses except for the size. The silicone is so soft that it doesn’t stay put in the clip for more than a few days at a time.,0
4,"1st - the material: It has almost a bit of sheen to it with a bit of that 1970's polyester look I wasn't expecting. Makes it seem 'office-wear' looking and I was just looking for a cute cheap summer casual skirt. Might be a bit hot in southern humid summers. Wash & hang dry for a wrinkle free existence.<br />2nd - the fit: based on other reviews, I sized up. Menopause & stress stole my waistline several years ago and I never pressed charges - Now I'm built like a wine barrel and normally wear an XL in most things - I ordered the 2X. I feel like it is sized exactly as I expected it to be. The waistband will never give me muffin top, and I may have even been just fine with an XL. It is a comfortable fit without feeling way too big or too small. There is A LOT of give and stretch in this (cheap) fabric. The length: I'm SHORT. 5'-2&#34; with short legs. with the skirt sitting where it should, the length is at least 2 inches below my knee. It makes it an odd length on me and probably only makes me look shorter. Even though it's really stretchy material with a surged edge that is then hemmed, I might just try and shorten the thing. If not, I'll roll the waistband like a yoga pant and hope it stays put. For a cheap skirt, I think I got exactly what I paid for and I'm ok with that.",1
3,Look cool but the inside paint on lense spider cracked all over so cant c out of them only had em for like a week?😦,0
1,"Just received this product but I have no idea what the combination is to the lock that is attached to the bag. Nothing inside the bag, no packaging slip, nothing on the tag....<br /><br />No idea how to get this lock off the bag other than getting some bolt cutters...<br /><br />Odd that the first thing I have to do with a theft-proof bag is clip a lock off of it and replace it.",0
5,My dad loved it!,1
4,Great fit !!!!,1
2,"When I first got it, I almost lost the little Fitbit cage because the screws taht hold the cage to the leather band came out. After 6 weeks of wearing, the silver coating of the metal parts has rubbed off, leaving a coppery looking base underneath. It makes me itch terribly. Looks nice, but I would not buy another one.",0
3,"Great fit other than it could have some wiggle room in the length, I am constantly pulling it up.",0
5,Excelente producto....,1
5,Love ❤️ the camo color.  Shorts are so comfy and cute!,1
3,This little trooper looks great on the night stand and the alarm is very effective.  In some cases it is a little too effective (induces panic from a dead sleep) and since there is no snooze you always run the risk of turning it off and falling back asleep.  It may be more effective if you place it across the room from your bed.,0
5,Love this watch!  The dial is large but very classy looking.  It keeps incredibly accurate time!  Was thrilled with that because I have had wind up watches in the past that either lost or gained time so I was constantly adjusting them.,1
5,So cute and delivered quickly,1
1,it is not his real nuber his real nuber is 18 not 19,0
5,I wear it all the time,1
1,It's not plus size at all,0
2,The shirt fit decent a little on the short side but the pants were way too short. Looked like high water pants,0
1,The material and dye was really cheap. It left marks on my skin.,0
5,I like it. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I would recommend it,1
5,I love my new bag!!! Fits all my stuff and it’s super cute! Beautiful color and great characters!,1
3,"TERRIBLE to steer. Ends up hurting your wrist, forearm and elbow.  Doesn't hold a whole lot so use it for 2 night trips. I wish I'd bought something else",0
4,bonita pero puedes escoger algo diferente,1
1,I bought XL size which was so ridiculously small. Couldn't cover/ wrap around my chest or waist. What a waste!,0
5,It's very attractive and sturdy. This isn't one of those umbrellas that flies away in the wind.,1
4,Product arrived earlier than original date. Wish it came with more packaging. Overall nice and very stylish.,1
4,"I am very pleased with this umbrella.  It is the perfect size for our small bar-height round table.  Great umbrella for the price... a really good value.  Looks beautiful on our deck.  Highly recommend.  And, it arrived well packaged and on time!",1
5,"Fit my 2 year old very well. She doesn't like sudden noises, and we got them so she could watch fireworks. They worked so well that she was able to sleep through the whole show!",1
1,"Out of the box, very noticeable scuff marks on the outside of one shoe and several small ones on the other shoe. I bought the shoes for my 3 y.o. niece for Christmas. Super cute but disappointed.",0
5,It hugs your body,1
5,"It's amazingly soft, and I love the fact that the stitching is outside and won't irritate my baby's skin.  It washes good as well. Love it",1
5,Super cute and writes well,1
2,"I bought this primarily as a cheap, and LIGHT bit of rain protection for a 3-week trip to Europe. The handle fell off the first time I opened it--in my home before. For this, I'd give it a 1, but I modified the handle a touch in my workshop, and it held up fine through a handful of storms on the trip. Thus, I give it a 2.",0
1,Didn't fit me and won't stay up.,0
4,I purchased this for my wife and she loved it.  I would recommend this to anyone considering purchasing this item.,1
3,"Hay modelos mas lindos para la playa o piscina. No esta mal pero esperaba otro calce. Es correcto, no compraria otro.",0
4,"The color of the hat is way darker than the picture, other than that it's pretty good.",1
5,Love it,1
3,"I received the shorts and was pleasantly surprised at the fitment and padding in the liner.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I did have one issue and discovered the zipper malfunctioned leaving the door open.  I had to wrestle with the zipper, eventually got it down, then zipped back up.  I will try using them once more, if it does it again, I will return for a replacement.  Other than that, they look and fit great.",0
2,Only two matched the photo. The other four were not expected patterns.,0
5,These are so incredibly comfortable!!!! They have plenty of room and are plush everywhere! I especially love how comfortable they are around the heel. Highly recommend these!,1
2,Really cute but thin material and runs small. Order one size bigger at least,0
4,"I think this shirt is really cute. I feel like I waited forever for it to come because it came all the way from China lol. I tried this on over a tank top just quickly for the pictures. It fits nice but there's a few random strings hanging off of it. Not a huge deal, I can just cut them off.<br />There is no tag at all, so you don't know which is the front or back, I guess it doesn't really matter with this stud shirt but there's also no washing instructions, they'd probably be in Chinese anyways so guess that doesn't matter either.<br />All in all, it's a cute summer shirt!! I like the color too.<br />I really hope it doesn't shrink to much!! I will update this review if I have any issues after washing.<br />I purchased this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
5,"The skirt is amazing,  the material is so nice, so soft, it has pockets  :) . I love it !!! Just to order  a size smaller",1
5,Super cute dress..,1
3,"This is  nice jacket except its fabric feel worn and balls up easily.<br />I am keeping it anyway. I need a jacket, even if it does feel years old.",0
2,the tide in the back to adjust the hat broke,0
3,"Beautfil design but the USB charging opening blocks the cable, doesn't fully go in. Charging that's why is a little bit hard!",0
5,So many compliments it fit perfectly,1
5,These are amazing! Got one for all the girls in the family.,1
1,Fits a toddler! If you have any curves at all don’t buy,0
1,"Tried for weeks to cancel order but system wouldn't allow. Finally recvd them and they were clearly not new. Box torn, inside paper torn, boot stiffener upside down in one boot. Definitely believe reviewers and buy one size larger if you're going to wear thick socks. Good boot, bad experience.",0
5,Very nice,1
5,I got the dark gray. It fits as expected. Very cute. Washes and dries with all my other clothes. No shrinking. Soft and thin but also warm. Almost feels like a thinner softer felt type fabric.,1
5,"The trend now is to try and lighten your loadout to sub 10lbs... And, if you're a lil twig stick figure, that may be possible. However, I'm 6'3 350lbs - my sleeping bag is the Coleman Big Basin! This backpack gets me and my &#34;lightweight&#34; gear here to Kalamazoo and back! For the price, it's a steal!",1
5,Boyfriend loves it,1
3,"Dress is bigger than what it should be. Unusual wear xl and it's slack on me. I am 180lbs, bought the xl, measurements b40-w38-h44. The print is the exact same thing but not as bright as the picture but still bright. And the material is thin thin thin! However it does not fade when washed and this dress is so soft and comfortable I can wear is everyday",0
5,"My little one is THISCLOSE to walking (plus it's cold here!), so he's in shoes every day. Up until today, it's been exclusively Robeez, but today we're trying the pedipeds. I was intrigued to see if there was a noticeable difference between the soft-soled Robeez and the hard-soled pedipeds in his ability to stand or shuffle along the couch--but so far I haven't noticed any difference.<br /><br />The shoes are extremely cute, well-made, and they seem quite durable (although I will come back in a few months to give an update). I wasn't sure how I would like the velcro tabs (which each open in a separate direction) because I am used to the ease of the stretchy Robeez...but I had no problems getting the shoes on. The boy was even interested by the velcro tabs and played with them while I was putting them on! (Thankfully he wasn't interested enough to actually undo the velcro!)<br /><br />I have uploaded a picture of my son wearing the shoes as well as the back of the shoe box, which gives approximate ages for the different sizes.<br /><br />I recommend these shoes, and am already planning on buying another pair in a larger size.",1
4,"These are very pretty. I gave them as Christmas gifts to my pointe students. Quality is wonderful and the colors are bright and beautiful! I gave 4 stars though because for my taste they were a bit big, but the girls loved them!",1
2,"I specifically ordered this pair for the colors: navy, fuchsia, turquoise, leaf green, etc. In actuality, they’re primary colors. Red, blue, green, blah. Otherwise they’re great. Thick and sturdy. BUT if you’re looking for softer colors, look elsewhere.",0
5,The necklace even looks prettier in real life than in the picture. I'm so glad that I ordered it! I hope that's spunky soul will come up with more styles for long necklaces. I'd buy more!,1
5,Fit as expected,1
3,"I absolutely love this bag, but the bottom ripped out of one side after just a few months of use.",0
5,bought this to go on our upcoming cruise.,1
4,Good so far,1
1,i couldn’t even walk down my hallway. i’ve never returned anything faster in my LIFE,0
5,They are worth every cent of what they cost. They are really really high. Got them for work because another girl wears them but a little high for me. Kinda feel like an anime character in a good way.,1
1,This is of very poor quality I sent it back,0
3,Work well a cleaning and polishing but something needs to be done about the edging shedding. I postpone using it for quick jobs because I will have to vacuum afterwards.,0
5,Beautiful bumble bee. I put it on a chain around my neck and receive many compliments. It's the perfect size and has plenty of sparkle.,1
5,"This dress is great!!! Fits good, very comfortable. I would suggest getting a little sweater to go with it, it can be a little opened at the top. Or get a pin.",1
5,"Well done Craftsmenship, best of all secured pin fastener",1
4,"My wife is cold all the time. With this sweater, she can be comfortable. She wears it all the time it seems like.",1
1,The seller was deceiving with material used. The shoes look cheap in person and are extremely small and narrow.  I returned this product immediately.,0
5,The length is perfect!,1
5,I have received several complements on these.,1
3,I purchased these for my grand daughter the 5th time wearing them the purple band came loose. The next time the other band came off.,0
1,I received the gift of my nephew in great time to find the socks were missing! The numbers on the shirt & shorts looked like a 2 year old glued them on! It was junk!,0
1,"I actually love the LOOK of the sock and the fit was fine, but I had a hole in the toe first time I wore them, not a tiny hole, a big hole. And no, my toenails do not need clipping. They had to go in the trash. I'm not going to wear holey socks. So while they're cute as heck, they are not good quality. I'm pretty bummed I paid this much money for a pair of socks I was only able to wear one time.",0
2,to small!!!!!,0
4,I love it. My son was looking super handsome. Somewhat too large for him.,1
2,"After about 10days, the pearl lost colour, and the necklace looks rusted. Now I have a plastic ball on a rusty looking string. Don't tell me &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. No no.. it was a waste of my money. This crap doesn't even worth 9 bucks!",0
3,The price and delivery were great. I am only disappointed with the quality of the finish. It already starting to peel off.,0
2,"I really didnt like anything about this dress. The way the lace is on the arms kinda looks like cheetah print and the tie at the waist was too low for me, it looked very awkward on.",0
1,"These are the ugliest boots I’ve ever seen. I have no idea why you thought I would like them. Of all the purchases I’ve made, nothing comes close to suggesting this would be something I’d wear!",0
3,The top did not fit right. Had to re-order another size,0
3,The product is good and really love it but the merchants deducted me twice on my account for the total price. I was trying to find a contact number to call them but there’s none.,0
5,Outstanding,1
1,"I bought small size, but when i wear it, it looks like medium or large. Size is not correct and quality is okay. better to check something else.",0
5,Absolutely perfect fit great quality,1
2,"Super thin material, good for a couple wears then holes developed. Not too pleased with them.",0
3,"I am not super impressed with the elastic waste band, seems a bit cheaply made<br />Went to Walmart and got Athletic Works shorts instead, the waistband is much better constructed",0
3,It is big and roomy just like I like my beach wear.,0
1,"The fabric is cheap, and the decoration horrible.",0
5,"This was just what I expected especially after reading the reviews. The material is shiney and a tad thin but not bad at all. I wore it twice. Once to a halloween party with friends and then on halloween to work, both times with cute halloween leggings underneath. I was very comfortable. I can even wear it again next year but for the price I will likely find another cute print to purchase.",1
5,"I really love this headband. It's really cute and stays put. I have a large head so it's always hard to find headbands that fit but this one does and it's super comfy. I've worn it for workouts and it's so nice that it stays and I don't have to fuss with it. It's a great headband, I got the black one and I'm going to buy some of the other fun colors!",1
3,"I was thrilled at the price of this purse, as I don't like paying huge prices for a handbag. If I'd written this review when I first received it, it would be five stars, b/c it is an absolutely beautiful purse. The detail on the outside and the charms that hang are classy and pretty. I got countless compliments on it. However, after about a month of use, most of the charms had fallen off, and the material in the outside pocket had come apart at the seams, so that I had to cut the material out b/c I was losing my stuff through the holes. Also, I'd like to add that I am a person that is typically very easy on stuff. My handbags usually last a year or so, and this is roughly the same amount that I spend on any handbag. So very pretty, but not conventional, it just won't hold up. I'm now looking for another new purse, when this one should still be my 'new purse.'",0
3,"The style was cool but, the quality was little on the cheaper side... the pins for the strap to the face... but, one can always get that replaced.",0
3,The shirt is very full and a bit short for a 5' 7&#34; person.,0
5,"Fits perfect, amazing quality material",1
2,Too large,0
2,"This is by far the worst item I've received through Amazon. The crouch is tight, the belt has loose threads hanging from it and the entire garment reaked of cigarette smoke. I had to remove the bag and garmet from my room to get rid of the nasty smell! But what should I expect for an outfit under $30, right? (As I spray Febreeze all over myself and my house)",0
1,It's not what the picture looks like. Low quality and bright red. Very thin material,0
1,"Looks nothing like the picture and doesn’t fit like described. Cheap heavy material, hangs on the body in a ridiculously funny way and drops below the knees. Plus you will have to pay for the return postage.",0
5,Pretty decent quality. Follow the size guide bc there is no stretch. I ordered a medium and it fits like a glove,1
3,"It's very light and gives proper protection to the eyes, but the fit wasn't as I expected. It brushes against my eye lashes, so I have to wear it loosely.<br />I guess its okay for the price.",0
3,Some of the red has fallen out on the rear side.,0
3,smaller than expected,0
2,Constantly pulling them up,0
1,They looked gold on my screen but arrived almost like a neon yellow. Just not my taste.,0
5,I purchased a pair of these earrings in Europe while on a cruise with my sister.  Decided to buy 2 more pairs for my two sisters..  found them on Amazon and the 3 of us wore them to my nephews wedding.  Got lots of compliments.  These earrings are beautiful and look very special and expensive.,1
5,My son can live in these. He absolutely loves them,1
5,The pajamas fit as expected. Material is medium quality. Good deal.  Took a long time to arrive (end of shipment range).,1
3,Little smaller,0
5,"These are the MOST AMAZING sunglasses. I have them in black. I get compliments on them all the time. I wasn't sure about buying sunglasses from amazon because these are one of those things that will either work for you or be garbage. I was so surprised with how well they fit my face and for the price, this was a no brainer. I bought these along with a super expensive T. Burch pair. I returned the more expensive ones because these looked better!",1
5,I have a 6 and 8 year old that are using these masks. They fit great and go on easy. Two thumbs up.,1
3,Its very itchy and the straps are nt adjustable,0
1,Just awful. So cheap. Get wat you pay for.,0
5,Greatest watch ever. At the price how can you go wrong? Keeps perfect time. I like the alarm feature. Mine takes tons of abuse and keeps going.,1
3,Decent quality for $4. Very lightweight so your ears won't sag.,0
4,Very nice and adjustable.,1
5,Nice product but too small.,1
5,"I bought this for my wife to wear to the store so she can read dates on food. She loves it, works well & is very nice looking.",1
2,Sent it back. The colors were not like this.. they were very pale and dull.,0
1,One word: CHEAP,0
2,"Cheap, looks cheap",0
2,"Said in commercial it would keep me 20 degrees cooler but when pouring water in hat was no different than pouring water in a regular hat . Blocked sun, yes but so does my straw hat. Disappointed to say the least. At least I bought through Amazon so I saved money that way.",0
2,Very nice dress with the exception that I could not get my arms in the sleeves!  They were way too tight.  The fabric was heavier than what I wanted;other than that it was well made and very pretty.  Can't figure out how to return it as no info in the package so will just donate it.  Frustrating because it is a beautiful dress.,0
4,"Very nice looking watch, looks more expensive than it is.<br />The only drawback was it is slightly thicker than I thought it would be however that is just a personal preference.",1
2,"Only received 5 pairs of socks, should have been 6 pairs.",0
3,"I’m going for my third try. I’m 61 and have worn size 10  normal width since 8th grade.<br />The length was way long. And yes, I used the size chart and measured my foot.<br />Oh well, going for size 9 this time. I love the slippers so I’m hoping these will be as comfortable one I get some that fit me.",0
2,this product is too large for the average wrist.  I would not recomment to friends or family or buy it again.,0
1,egh,0
3,Cute but was disappointed in the material.  Very easily wrinkled.  Also when got it had to wash it 3 times cause of a very strong smell. Also very small.,0
5,Love it. It's light to carry and very roomy.,1
3,I wanted something fitted so it is a bit looser and is a thinner material than what I thought I was getting but I still like it. It would be great for the hot summer months or if you plan on getting hot and sweaty. It also does not have a built in bra of any sort.,0
1,It’s so small a baby could wear it fashionably. No adult could get it around their head without breaking it.,0
5,"Just what i expected. Perfect size, not to small or big. I’m thinking of buying another in a different color. Was delivered quickly",1
1,"This Apron is thinner, lighter, and stitching different 5han what is advised at the ""Roundhouse"" website. I think I have finally been had on Amazon.....",0
1,"Worse than silver, rusted in a week, looks obviously fake, didn't fit straight or stay in place, horrible quality.",0
5,I have a very small face and this one fits perfectly and it does not look like a 'kiddie' shades,1
1,Ear holes not big enough and in wrong spot.  Material of mask is poor and frays easily.  Will not last.  Also does not seal well and is very uncomfortable.  Nose piece works well and plastic valves are the same quality as replacement set I purchased separately.  For the money this is not a good choice.  My throw away mask has held up better.,0
5,"Best socks, always a desirable and funny design, but comfort above all",1
5,Runs a little small,1
2,Way too small,0
4,Not a fan of the plastic zipper but overall great for the price,1
3,I’m normally a size 0 to size 1 in pants the sx fit well minus if you have a bigger butt it will eat it. The belt is super cheap haven’t even worn it out once and two out of three of the belt Sequences already fell off super cheaply made and totally not worth the money. Luckily the body suite or cape isn’t to shabby.,0
4,Good fit. G/f loved it.,1
1,The outfit is the worse. Maybe it's just me but I couldn't figure out how to put the top on lol. It will be returned,0
5,high quality and perfect for my application to display my very old antique pocket watch.,1
2,"It doesn't fit, being much too large, but I kept it - I'll probably gain more weight as I age anyway!  I normally wear a size 3X or 22/24.  Since other buyers indicated this product ran large, I sized down to a 2X, but it doesn't do a thing to hold me in or smooth me out.  The fabric is a lot softer and stretchier than I expected, too, but that may be common to Spanx products (this is the first I've bought).  Since it's so loose, though, it's very comfortable, so it's got that going for it!",0
5,Bought it for my 4 year old as a 'play' wallet. I thought it would be a cheap plastic wallet that my son will take apart in a few days. I was wrong.<br /><br />The wallet was more than expected. It is a very usable everyday wallet. Looks like its a genuine Marvel product and the quality seems pretty good.<br /><br />I would recommend this for any Marvel fan.,1
2,Mine came apart at the side seams after a couple of washings. My other satin nightgowns lasted for years unlike this one.,0
5,"Looks good, wears good",1
5,Fabulous,1
2,"Would have received a great review, had it been long sleeve like in the photo and description.  Couldn't return it because I needed it for my baby's birthday party several days away.",0
4,Not to heavy,1
1,"I have no ideal why I order 2, it blings but very cheap looking.  I did not know who to send all of these back to.",0
3,"Nice scarf, but very thin. You have to be careful around the ends because it can start unraveling",0
1,"ZERO STARS!!!<br />I ONLY WORE these shoes TWICE and they are coming apart!!  I tried to ""return them, however I guess the ""window"" I had for returning is ""closed"".  DO NOT PURCHASE these SHOES they are VERY CHEAPLY made!!!",0
4,"quality is not as nice, but it was still very comfortable for my 2 yr old to wear!!",1
3,Love the looks of the hat but it wasnt actual trucker hat material like I was expecting. Material was much thinner.,0
5,I got one for my 2 year old and another one for my 5 year old! Have not had my daughters try it on since it’s a present they will open on Christmas eve. The material is very thin but it’s cute. The pants *look* a bit wide but not long enough. It came with some beautiful thick santa socks and a little santa hat. That was a great little surprise. Thank you!,1
5,This scarf is so full & beautiful.,1
1,Very disappointed.  This is cheaply made and NOT AS LONG AS Advertised.  I bought it for my elderly grandmother to wear since she has problems with clasps from her arthritis. I would have been better off being her a set of white Mardi Gras beads!,0
5,&#34;I was very pleased with my purchase&#34; & &#34;*My Nana Loved It*&#34;!! &#62; &#34;Thank U So Much&#34;!,1
1,[[VIDEOID:80dda06cc36db9c97eb53e69abf1df38]] Not very durable...cheap material,0
4,I bought these for my younger brother who runs cross country. He absolutely loves them and loves the lime green with his orange shoes,1
5,perfect,1
1,Junk.,0
5,"These are a good length for men or women (and probably kids too). My husband is happy I shared them with him. Love the adjuster, that's a very clever idea. The ring clips are a little larger than other lanyards I have so they are easier to work with and fit around the cloth mask loops.",1
5,very erotic,1
5,"It is soft, light weight and so comfortable. I love the length. Should transition from fall to winter to spring seamlessly. I love it!",1
5,I brought this for my son.. And he and I both love the fit. The package came on time as well. So far so good. Thanks,1
3,"Pearl was about twice the size I expected. The metal bent as I was taking it out of the bag. For $.99 it wasn't worth sending back. Not bad looking, just not for me.",0
5,"Got this for my husband for Valentine day, he has one just like it, but is worn and dirty!<br />He loves the flexibility of the wallet, not hard to set on!",1
5,Awesome,1
1,"Was disappointed. Returned. Just wanted a basic tee, a wardrobe staple. Ran very small, too stretchy and sausaged in.",0
5,great,1
4,Material was nice. It would have been great if it fit right. The sizing is off. I suggest getting it a size or two larger.,1
5,Keeps me warm,1
5,They were great!,1
2,Thin material not worth the price. Looks cheap I wear as pjs,0
5,I loved the shoes. The shoes are really comfortable and the material was made really well. Good quality.,1
1,You have to size up with this one. But it’s really cheap looking and feels cheap,0
5,Great for a dressy look to enhance gold accessories.,1
3,"I have to say that I  bought a pack of socks from this brand  as a  lightning deal about a year  ago, and they  have held up SO well! I was really surprised at how  much I liked the fit, and  how well they  have  washed and  worn. I decided to buy another pack, and  went with these more white  colored socks. This pack was NOT 'cushioned' at all, and  you can see  right through the tops of them. They  are definitely not what I would consider an athletic sock, they are a  basic, white sock with stripes on them - pretty much what  I expected the other pack to be when I got them. My advice is to go with their other socks - that have more cushioning in them and are a thicker  material.",0
1,Terrible! Too small!,0
1,Two fo them broke after 1 day!!,0
5,I received the patch and I was very pleased with the quality and clarity of the patch. The patch is a weave iron on and the image is clear and detailed. Looks good because it irons on tight to the material and is thin unlike the thickness of an embroidery patch.,1
5,Bought these as a gift. The size was perfect. I was worried they may not fit but seems as though they fit a wide range of feet sizes.,1
3,Lenses are good but strap is thin. Gteat for starting out skiers.,0
5,"They actually look better in person than in the photos, good item for the price. Nice",1
1,not compression tanks at all. very disappointed as item doesn’t fit the description at all. i first ordered large based on the size chart. then ordered medium as the large were way too large. now i have both large and medium and both are too large and both are not compression tanks as described.,0
2,"The dress is more like a swimsuit cover , extremely thin .",0
2,This isn’t very comfortable with the Velcro not fitting right! The stretch isn’t good!,0
1,Very very very disappointed in this item. My logo is crooked.,0
5,I bought these as a birthday gift for a friend. The frames are unique and very easy to add rhinestones to!,1
1,"Disappointed  really.  They aren't even sewn well. There's a weird, uneven  widows leek thing going on with the ones I got. Plus, maybe I have a small head, ( I really don't ) but they don't fit tight at all. I had to keep pulling it out my eyes when I used it.",0
4,There nice but they easily slide side ways,1
1,don't waster your time if your a side M or larger. Very cheap and does not apply US sizing accurately,0
1,This dress looks nothing like the picture above and the material is so think it’s so poorly made.,0
5,conforme,1
1,"Fits like a belly shirt, I’ll be sending it back",0
3,Waaaaaaaay to small.  They work great for my daughter though!,0
5,Purchase a size down. I love this and a very easy go to when I’m in a rush. Always receive a number of compliments,1
1,You cannot see the engraving... It's tiny... This is also not pandora comparable despite the search results... Refunded with ease,0
5,"I loved that this worked for a Thanksgiving outfit without being brown and orange. It was soft, and my kiddo looked super cute in it. The matching hat was also adorable and fit my son even though he has a pretty big head circumference.",1
4,"They are made from the moisture wicking material.  They are not as wide as they appear to be, and they do not have neat sewn edges.  They are just strip of material sewn together and folded.  It would have been nice for them to have been neatly sewn on the edge and a little wider (per the photo).",1
3,Fit was larger than expected.  It is a good slipper for inside or canoeing - if you don't have to walk over rocks.  Sole is a lot thinner than I expected.  This is really a yoga / pool / indoor work out slipper.,0
5,So pretty!,1
1,Horrible fabric quality. Oddly slinky and shiny. Sent it back pronto.,0
2,"I realize these aren't expensive sunglasses, but they feel super cheap and rattle-y. They came with a pretty nice case, a cleaning cloth, and a little glasses repair screwdriver. I'd rather they had skipped all that and just put a little more quality into the glasses.<br /><br />That being said, they were really pretty (I got the blue ones) and I might have kept them except they were way too big for my face. Sorry to say these were a miss for me.",0
5,I have received many compliments from this bathing suit. True to size.,1
4,Really nice watch...,1
5,Love it. Fits perfectly,1
5,love the material size is perfect and has shoulder straps.  Great product !!!!,1
2,The gadgets on the glove fell off immediately. Leather is nice but disappointing.,0
5,"I bought this for my daughter as an Easter present. She is raising a lamb for 4H and I wanted something for her to have as a momento for her efforts.  Item was just as pictured. I will need to replace the chain, her long hair gets tangled in the clasp.",1
3,I thought that I was getting a coral color sweater but this sweater is very light pink. No where near the color coral.,0
1,"Showed up in a bag in pieces, returned immediately.",0
5,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves them (:,1
3,"Not totally impressed for the size and style, seems cheaply made and zipper pieces are cheap not one of my better Purchases, The material is very plastic-like and the straps are very weird,<br />The best part about it is that it’s cute  for kids to hold it..",0
5,"Comfortable, soft fabric, nice color, as shown.",1
2,The sizes run small so what ever size you are get bigger,0
3,Good product but it doesn't fit 100% as original equipment. There is some sort of dancing once on the frame!!! Even though good!!!,0
5,"I love this bracelet. It's stretchy, though I don't have much of a wrist, but it's really beautiful, not pinchy. I love how glittery it looks. Looks real.",1
5,Great watch. This is my second one. Great craftsmanship. Held up for me in most situations and gone swimming a numerous amount of times without any issues!,1
3,"Like the color and it does look good. BUT, the ""leader"" is pretty hard, the two outside zipper pockets too small for me regular size phone, even my keychain hardly fit.... I’m not overly excited.",0
5,Nice looking hat.,1
5,"A pretty dress, love it",1
1,"No  Sheer back, looks like a little girl's dress",0
5,So adoreable!,1
1,does not fit my face properly,0
3,Adorable design but doesn’t fit properly. Is way smaller than a typical 12 .,0
1,"Big design flaw.  I've been using it less than a week and twice the keychain has opened unexpectedly, sending my housekey flying.  Once I was in the parking lot of the grocery and it's a wonder I found it.  Do not recommend!",0
1,Top snap ripped out when i tried to unsnap after trying it on.,0
5,"They are perfect, I haven't taken them off since I purchased them.  The quality is excellent and the style is perfect.",1
5,Cool and nice product for great price,1
1,Too itchy to wear. Washed it and it didn't soften. No way is the 100% cotton. This is made of something else. Feel like paper and makes a crinkle sound. Do not recommend.,0
5,Nothing,1
5,They arrived sooner than expected which was awesome!  Love my new rainboots,1
5,Not too big or too small for my 3 year old,1
5,"We used this at an Easter event at our local elementary school and the KIDS LOVED IT!<br />It's a well made thin plastic suit which you get into and zip up in the back (from the outside, so you need a helper). It uses four AA batteries to power a fan which inflates the suit once you are in it. The 3 inch fan is the only ventilation though, so it can get hot inside the suit especially if you are in the sun!<br />The suit was a hit - we will definitely be using it again next year!",1
3,"It's pretty, but it's not comfortable to move around in. It might be the design of the sleeves. The color is rose gold, not yellow gold.",0
2,"Strange fit, it looks like a shirt that tried to be a dress, but got cut to short. The neck line is also very strangely made. Can be a bit uncomfortable at times, construction is just so weird. The stitching is just decent loose threads here and there but not the worst job. The fabric feels like that fabric that would snag and catch on everything. The fabric is also sticky to the skin and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't purchase it, the fabric feels strange, and the fit and build are not the best. Feels like a cheap shirt from a clearance store.",0
5,I love it and will wear to go to the gym for sure!<br />The fabric is so soft and theses transparent details on the sides are incredible !,1
2,Mine broke after just two days...,0
1,fits like a bag after following the other review suggestions.  The neck is very high. Definitely returning.,0
1,"I ordered an XL in this dress.  I usually get a large but didn't want to take the chance on it being too small.  Well, it's too small!  But not in the waist.  The waist fits perfectly and is very slenderizing.  But I could not zip it all the way up.  I wear a 38B so I'm not really busty.  This is just cut really small across the bust and back.  The front bustline looks awful too.  Nothing flattering about it at all.  If you're small busted, it makes you look smaller!  The sleeves are nice.  The fabric is a heavy crepe fabric.  This dress came down to about 5"" below my knees.  I am 5'8"" tall.  Not flattering and size is way off.",0
1,As soon as I opened the package I was hit with a terrible smell of plastic and chemicals.  I let the shoes sit out for two days and the smell is still pretty strong.  I would be concerned about my toddler wearing these and those chemicals seeping into her skin. I will be returning these and sticking to the original Mini Melissa’s from now on!,0
5,The shirt can not be beat for the price. It does run large for me even though it’s supposed to be oversized. 5’7 140 36c and I usually take small or mediums and I needed an extra small in this. Great quality I ordered in multiple colors.,1
1,Baby dress was cute but even after being washed something in the neckline irritated her skin. Toddler dress was too low cut in the front and nothing but string in the back. Not a very age appropriate design.,0
3,Solid quality and looks great. But i needed a .5” pin as advertised for a project but the pin is actually .76”.,0
3,"Looks great, but the clasp needs to be in another location. Already lost the bracelet in the first two weeks. The clasp opens when your wrist hits countertops and tabletops.",0
5,Works perfect with my Samsung watch. I get so many compliments on the look.,1
5,Really cute. Durable.,1
1,"Unfortunately the ordering of this tie was such a headache for me. I wanted four mint green ties for my wedding party's groomsmen, and since I live out of the country I decided to buy one to start off and have my parents look at the color. The first tie delivered came just as the color in the photo is shown, and with a matching handkerchief, so since we were happy with it I proceeded to order three more. The following three ties ordered were an olive color with no matching handkerchief. I was stuck with three ties of an off-color and one that worked. I then had to order one more, hoping it would come the olive color and I received a mint tie just as the first I ordered! At that point I had two ties of one color and three of another! I then had to order two more (this time olive) and was stuck with five olive ties and two mint. We used the olive ties, because of time constraints after placing so many orders, but the color was off and I will be returning the extra and the two mint ties I had originally hoped for.",0
4,This product is exactly what I expected it to be.  Nothing fancy and the details aren't so defined but it seems solid.  My daughter loves it.,1
2,It’s definately not like the picture looks I got the wine color and it’s not solid like the picture shows it is more of an off white with the red color as well,0
3,They do the job but I have sinus issues and often have a metallic smell in my nose from this jewelry so the quality is kind of questionable. I keep them clean and I’ve never had this issue with any other septum jewelry I’ve worn.  So far no irritation though,0
5,True to size,1
2,After 3 days of wearing starts to ball up and fuzzy up. Comfortable but not lasting at all.,0
5,These are sporty enough that my grandson thought we was at a Nascar race......but was really at a concert....close enough that he needed to have some of the sound blocked out so he'd be comfortable. Even though it was an orchestra concert...it was close proximity so he could see the instruments. He happily wore the ear protectors and they did allow some of the music to be heard (I tried them on too.),1
1,"Really disappointed, wanted to wear this dress to a wedding. Wish they would have said it runs smaller than normal sizes.",0
5,Fits perfectly!,1
3,Love the look of these but they aren't very durable. Broke within a week of receiving them.,0
3,"I ordered a 'Siva Women's Casual Long Sleeve Pullover Hoodies Crop Top Sweatshirt' in a medium for review.  This sweatshirt is huge for a medium, it is  cropped at the right length but the shoulders and breadth of it is huge.  The material is not very soft and after washing it with fabric softener it did not soften up much.  It is of decent thickness, but just hangs on my wife who normally wears a medium but prefers a large for extra room.  This is even too big for her.  Overall, so-so quality and a terrible fit.",0
2,They tend to roll down at the waist..,0
1,Don’t waste your money. The sizing is not right and they are very uncomfortable.,0
4,Lots of fun. Create unique looks.,1
1,Poor quality. Does not look like the photos.,0
2,My item came cracked and it was for my son's birthday I don't think it was shipped that way I guess I have to buy it again,0
5,"Really impressed with quality for price, excellent gift idea. Lots of links, I have to take out at least 3, so this is great for someone who has a big wrist. Beautiful rose tone and beveled face.  Overall, I'm very impressed, love the look and feel of this watch!",1
5,They are good,1
2,Was super excited to get this dress I’d had it in my cart for awhile. It’s not the true cotton spandex material like most maxi dresses. It’s see through at the top with the light gray I have to wear a cami underneath which defeated the purpose of a nice cool dress for summer heat and to top it all off it turns out it’s hand wash only! Not a simple throw on dress.,0
1,Warning this is not a new hat. If not worn it was definitely used as an accessory,0
5,The necklace is beautiful. I also got the matching earrings. Highly recommend,1
1,Esta muy descubierto de atrás,0
3,"I received 1 piece of really nice black kyanite. 1 of the black pieces & 3 or 4 of the blue pieces were a disappointment. The white shiny piece was interesting. Although I received an extra piece in my shipment, I would’ve preferred a couple of better pieces instead.",0
5,"Most  Beautiful of dresses. These dresses of similar price, I should give a bad review, but they are great. Surprising well made. My need a tuck or two. There are several dresses more expensive but not worth the cost.<br />Jiaoyan,Y.S.H. Are a  few well made, long lasting.",1
5,I Love this hat. With fleece inside it is soooooo warm. Great color goes with everything,1
5,"I had a $5 Amazon gift card and decided to get these. The lipstick ones specifically because they were about $5. I'll be getting at least one in every style now. These are so soft and so comfy. These were labeled as one size so I figured I'd be taking a gamble at getting them, considering other one size leggings were too small. These are actually a bit too big. At least the waistband is. They looked too small right out of the package and I thought I was going to end up with see-through leggings, but surprisingly they have a lot of stretch before that happens. I wanted to use these as running leggings, but I think I'll have to use them for strength training since they are just a bit too big, I don't want to have to worry about pulling them up every few steps (unless I re-elasticate the waistband). The only worry I have is since they are so soft, and my thighs rub, idk how long will they live before my thighs rub holes through them. But like I said, I plan on buying more. The other prints are about $10, but that's worth it if they all fit like this one. For me, they are semi high waisted, which is what I like, and they go down to my ankles. They do show panty lines pretty easily, tho. I'm 5'3&quot; and a size 5 in jeans. My waist is about 30 inches and my hips are about 38 inches. If you're bigger than me, then I'm sure they will fit fine, but if you're super skinny they may bag a little.",1
3,"Cute fit and cute pattern, but the buttons aren’t functional and the material is pretty cheap. 5’3” 115lbs and the small fits well.",0
5,Very cute my daughter loves them,1
1,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PUTCHASE THIS!!!!! It looks nothing like what is advertised.  There's some weird pokey gathering that is bonkers.  The slots are like u shaped and not actual slits.  It looks like 5 year old sewed this garment.",0
3,"It's a beautiful bracelet, but the leaves are too delicate.  I'm sure that with repeated use, the leaves and where they attach will get damaged.",0
1,Came in torn,0
5,Fit perfect. I have a large head..... 7 &5/8 sized fitted ball cap. This mask fits great! And you are a fan of Nightbreed this mask is super rad. Trick or treat studios also has a Peloquin mask that looks awesome. Your welcome,1
1,These slippers look nice but when I first went to put them on I mistook the insole for a cardboard retainer.  The velcro hook was too far back to hook once the slipper was on.  Will return.,0
1,Do not like the fit,0
2,"I own a jacket very similar. I’ve gained weight recently and the small I have is tight now. I’m running in between a small and medium but I usually go with mediums. So even though I knew this was a different brand than my old one, I figured the medium was a safe bet. It fit significantly smaller than the one I currently have. I couldn’t even get it on my shoulders. I wasn’t even sure if a large would fit so I didn’t chance exchanging it, I just returned it. Jacket looks like it would have been made well but was just so tiny.",0
3,"For the price, this is a great sweater.  It runs longer than shown but is very good quality.  The only problem is that the color is NOT as pictured.  I would return it but will save it for another outfit as it was so inexpensive.  The color is khaki  -- as in khaki pants but is really an olive green.",0
2,"It is really, really large and heavy. It's beautiful, but outside of that is definitely not meant to go in your septum unless you have really large nostrils. It would probably be better as a daith or maybe even nipple ring.",0
1,This dress was very poorly made. I do not recommend.,0
5,"My fav for sure. I love that the wrist and ankles aren’t loose because I don’t like them riding up and exposing my skin while I sleep. Even though you’re covered from head to toe, they still have a bit of sexiness to them. I especially like the ones that have an animal print look to them.<br />My only negative is I’d like to see more variations in colors.",1
5,used this as a party favor at wedding for the groom and it fit nicely.,1
5,Very nice bag. Holds a lot of stuff. Very sturdy. Folds very small. Perfect to throw in knapsack for purchases.,1
4,has not turned color love the feel and not heavy. Wish it was a little bigger,1
1,"Really isn't worthy to buy, poor quality and blurred words, totally useless",0
5,Super cheap for all the charms you get! Same quality as the croc store I loved all of them,1
3,I don't like the padding on the boob. I have large press and the padding looks stupid. The arm is a little too big. But it's a gorgeous dress. I couldn't wear it to the wedding because cleavege area was too big. Womp womp.,0
3,Product is made well but it did not flatter me at all so returned,0
5,I got this apron to create a personalized apron for my niece. The fit was perfect for her and the apron took my heat transfer vinyl well. She loved the gift and it should last for a long time!,1
1,This thing is huge. Not useful as a keychain. Regret buying it.,0
5,"made of soft premium quality leather, fits in all my cards perfectly.",1
4,Theses slippers were delivered on time and make a comfortable house shoe and a happily received gift!,1
5,"nice and comfortable. it makes me anxious at the gym to wear exposing clothing but honestly, i like not being over heated.",1
5,Very light weight and very comfortable!--Be Careful when washing  fabric softeners can damage material,1
2,"Super cute costume! Be warned though, it runs on the small side. The advertising is a bit conflicting because they say plus sizes and the next sentence states small/medium.<br /><br /> I'm 5'7&#34;, 130 pounds, 36C and I can squeeze into this outfit. If I really wanted to I could wear it but it would be uncomfortable. I wouldn't make it over an hour.  There is no stretch whatsoever and it pulls from top to bottom.<br /><br /> I'm guessing a 5 foot four 110 pound body would fit nicely into this costume.<br /><br /> The fur leg warmers are pretty awesome and is the reason I am keeping the costume and not returning it.<br /><br /> The costume seems well-made and the colors are nice. There is a shimmer to the material as well. The fur hat is adorable and fits loosely without falling off.",0
1,Cheap looking and left a greenish ring on the back of my neck when I wore it for a full day.,0
5,Like very much. Fit well,1
2,The fabric is thinner than I thought and the design is off so much that you can’t read that it says “Among Us.” Both masks are too big for my 4 year old Grandson.,0
1,One of the arms fell off after only a couple wears.,0
2,I ordered a larger size so it would be loose fitting and it fit like a much smaller size.,0
2,The gemstone color is nice but the metal is crap. It looks burnt. Definitely not worth the money.,0
4,Slightly larger than expected and wish the side zipped up so items would not fall out.,1
5,Amazing sunglasses.  The auto adjusting tint is great for the partially cloudy days.  The nose bridge piece is very comfortable and adjustable.  Worth the money.,1
1,Stockings were too tight and took great effort to get on without help. After wearing for several hours I had pain in my legs and again had to struggle to get the off by myself. I would not recommend these to anyone who has a moderately larger calf and or has to put them on and remove them by themselves. As a nurse there is no way I could have worn them to work in.,0
5,"A beautiful piece, it goes with so many outfits and you can be creative with the way you wear it too. You may lose some sequins here and there but still beautiful and worth the investment. I wore it on top of a basic white turtleneck shirt.",1
5,My husband was thrilled with his gift!,1
5,"Absolutely stunning, plain white shades, size and tint.",1
3,More for prom night.,0
3,It's fine.  Wish the visor was bigger,0
4,"I love it, it's super cute and fits my 5 month old great!! Disappointed with how easily it ripped when I washed it but luckily the rip is in the back.",1
5,"Excelente tamaño, llego cuando me dijeron q tenía q llegar",1
2,Made in India. Not too vet friendly.,0
1,I will be returning it. Part of it is tarnished and doesn't appear to be sterling.,0
5,These were a gift for my daughter. She wanted sandals like her dad's but they don't make this style for girls. I ordered a 4 1/2 boys and they fit great.,1
4,nice,1
2,The description says engraved this was not!! Instead it appears as if it was painted on it was heavy but thw writing can easily be wiped off.,0
5,I got these to fly my Prism Quantum Stunt kite.  Although that kite comes with Wrist straps these are much more comfortable to use.  The padding is pretty good and they seem to be holding up well.  Defiantly recommend these.,1
1,poor quality and fits way too big,0
1,they would be beautiful if they were all in one piece.  I ordered two and both of them have such a cheap chain that they are all undone.,0
5,"I get a lot of compliments on these fun earrings, very tasteful and pretty.",1
1,way way too small for the size indicated!!!,0
5,"This replaced my old inserts that wore out over the years. They seem durable, have used for awhile now & still look new. Love it came with 2, I use 1 for frequently used cards like DL, credit cards, ...in my wallet & the other to keep gift cards & business cards in my purse so organized when needed.",1
5,My child loves the costume and wants to wear it all the time...love it...Thank you!!!,1
5,"The sharp, the style and design were what attracted me to want this jewelry set.  Friends couldn't tell if fake or the real thing.",1
4,"I use these with a thermal glove over them to add a little more heat protection and to protect my other fingers. I would not use these without a thermal glove. I use these with my Remington curling wand, which came with the glove but my thumb and forefinger would get too hot using the glove alone. The addition of these heat shields makes my curling process so much better.",1
3,"Too small, order two sizes larger",0
5,Easy in install looks great fits great,1
2,"Online these earrings look larger like for an adult. They are not!  They are too big for a baby, toddler, but good for  a little girl. They are so cheap, I just kept them for a future gift.",0
5,Very nice. Everything I wanted and it came in a very timely fashion/,1
5,"Beautiful blouse, daughter loves the long cut in the back! Nice spring top looks great",1
3,"I like the dress but the color is WAY off and so is the material. I thought that it was cotton but it’s such a weird feeling material. It’s very see through. Also, it looks more blue than gray. It’s not gray at all. The picture shows it being very gray...almost a heather gray but it isn’t at all. I’m disappointed in the dress. I ordered it for Easter thinking it would be so perfect but I’m just not sure about it. I will keep it but I’m sure when I wash it, it will be ruined. Not worth the money.",0
5,"Bought this for a lil surprise gift for my fiancée. And she loves it. If you buy for an adult, you will have to buy a longer chain for it.",1
5,Well made and looks great!,1
5,Great for what it says.  My dad loves them! Wears them everyday,1
4,A little large.  But sooo soft,1
5,nice,1
3,Runs small! Gets holes quick,0
3,"I bought the sandals for an upcoming trip.  They look nice, but I don't know if they will be comfortable for walking around, casually.  I have not worn them, yet.",0
1,"Cute although the quality of the fabric was like a cheap windbreaker. Didn’t use it because the strap attached to the handle was useless. When held by the strap loop, the umbrella handle extended making it NOT compact for carrying around. Returned. Design inside was cute and vibrant. So if you’re going to just throw in a bag and not carry around by the strap, AND you don’t mind paying $18 for something that should cost $6. Then you might be happy.",0
5,Apple Watch,1
3,"The little adjustable piece’s end that has the metal on it gets caught/snags on everything. Like it doesn’t sit flush with the band because it’s just after the velcro, if that makes sense. Other than that, it was comfortable and clicked onto my watch easily.",0
4,It was a tad shorter than I expected. But it was still cute. I got compliments. I’m 5’8”,1
5,Very nice.  Christmas gift for my mother and she had her stuff in it the next day.  I guess she like it.,1
3,"So these look awesome, but they run very small. I wear 16mm and I wear teardrop style plugs often. These are probably at least .5mm smaller than the rest of mine. They’re still wearable, but I definitely have to leave my gauges out overnight to be able to wear them the next day. If you have larger gauges, you might consider sizing up.",0
5,I love everything I’ve received from Zenergy Gems! All of the crystals and gemstones are high quality and have great energy! Friendly customer service and fast shipping. Namaste,1
5,Ordered these for my grandsons they look bed these for their crocs very happy.,1
5,"Nice quality t-shirt, good graphics that pop, great fabric, good cut and stitching.  But beware, they run small, especially through the chest and shoulders.  I am 5'4&#34;, 118 lb, 34C, trim and fit, and I usually wear a medium t-shirt because I'm broad through the shoulders.  I had to return the medium and re-order a size Large.  I ordered two of them, so it wasn't just mis-marked.  I really like the shirt, but watch the sizing.",1
5,Really like both belts. Wish there were more colors to choose from.,1
3,"Didn't fit as expected. I ordered a small because of the measurements and it was still a bit big and much longer than expected as well. But the quality is good, I will just get it altered a bit.",0
3,"Very sturdy, long tie clips. However, be careful that the edges of the back clip is smooth, or it will cause you too pull threads out of your time when putting it on or taking it off.  I'm just being careful with them, but I'm sure you can smooth it out with a nail file.",0
2,Dress pretty but way to tight in the bust area.,0
5,I love this band. It goes with anything and is very comfy. I get lots of compliments on it.,1
3,"NOT designed for DD+, unless you are going for that OOPS factor!<br />It is very soft and comfortable otherwise 🤣",0
1,The sizing on this product was ridiculous.  I am not sure if they used the same measurements as the other companies to define small medium and large.  Usually a large is a bit tight on me.  Each shoulder had at least a spare two inches and the chest had an extra five.  I was swimming in it.,0
3,Packaging was great and arrived quick. Material is very thick; more like a man would like this shirt. Doesn’t look feminine nor can be manipulated to wear as the picture because it’s really thick.,0
5,fits great,1
3,Too big,0
2,"Very cute on the site, but when receiving the product, I was very disappointed. It very very very small, unless u have super short hair, it doesn’t even show at all",0
4,"I love the length of this too. While I’m not crazy about the material, more satiny, not contton-like, I may not have read the details. It is a great fit and has some stretch to it, and I’ll definitely order more from the seller.",1
3,"The dress itself is fine, no complaints really but Be careful with the person doing the fitting . They sent an email around 12:00 am saying they wanted my measurement. The next morning around 9 am they said they were just going to send me a dress that was not my size at all since they didn’t receive my measurements. When i tried to correct the person, although they did change it, they weren’t apologetic about the way they were handling the situation in the slightest. My dress came and it’s not that bad but i would be careful  with ordering",0
5,"I like the ring, its a bit bigger of a stone than i thought it would be. Its still a nice ring for the price.",1
5,Good to were🌬🌨🌬,1
2,"Love this dress, but it was too loose on top and too tight in the waist.  I am 5'4"" and 180 pounds.  I ordered a 2XL based on other reviews.  Not something I would buy again.",0
1,"These were satisfactory to begin with. They kept hands mildly warm (even on the hottest setting, they were not hot). But, after using a couple of times a week for a month so maybe 15 times maximum, they have stopped working completely. The batteries still work, but the gloves will not stay on. They light up for 30 seconds and shut off without warming. I picked these gloves as they have battery packs that would be easily replaceable, not thinking that the gloves themselves would die so quickly. I am very disappointed. As it is now just past Amazon's 30-day return policy, I've contacted the company and am waiting to hear from them.",0
4,I just got finished taking this carry on underseater on a trip to Florida. It worked great! It fit under the seat on a Delta flight with no problems. I was in the middle seat for three of my flights and a window seat on the last one. I fit more clothes in there than I thought I would be able to. It worked well. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the zippers don't always slide smoothly. But for the convenience of not having a lift a suitcase to the over head bins made my trip so much easier.,1
3,"The print on this dress is gorgeous I but top is made too small for my bust 36C. Dress did not wrap/close properly at chest area. Would def need to wear a cami or bralett under which I felt took away from the dress. Returned dress, customer service was prompt in issuing refund.",0
2,"I ordered this to blend in to a beautiful white dress I have… I happen to have WHITE sweatpants on when this arrived yesterday, it is not plain white!! It is off white… not cream, not shimmery… OFF WHITE. I would show a pic but it’s in the wash right now. I may throw it in with my WHITES and was again, cause I put bleach in with my Whites!!",0
3,"I love the band,but it keeps coming undone from the fit2. There for I have to mark it down.",0
1,"Terrible quality. Thin, odd seams (Uneven, some look like it was sewn to look inside out?), no shape. I waited too long to return (my fault) so now I’m stuck with it. If I had bought this for $10 I’d be a little less annoyed by it but for $27.99 I’ve gotten way better quality products on amazon.",0
5,Feel great and are sized correctly,1
5,Great Shoe & Comfortable,1
5,"I'm tall hard to find long enough skort.j I'm 5'10 and 175 lbs, I ordered xl and it gives me a little extra room. The shorts are breathable and my cell phone fits Leg pocket on shorts. I bought a black one too.",1
3,"They fit perfect but the materials are cheap. For instance, the clasp can easily be broken or bent and the wire/string used for the necklace serves it purpose, however, isn’t if a good sturdy material. I would say these are better for teens although fits an adults neck perfectly.<br />Thank me later.",0
5,This purse is beautiful!!! Very pleased,1
5,"Ok - so I bought way too many masks for my kiddo for school.  These masks are the best as it has a nose piece, the design is great so that it doesn't sit right on her face like many other ones.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",1
3,The clasp is  made for TINY fingers. I had to use tweezers to put it around my friend's neck,0
5,"Love these leggings.  I am tall and they are plenty long enough (I have 34&#34; inseam), very soft, not see through.  I wish they had other colors because I would order them up!",1
5,Perfect.,1
3,"Wallet material is very stiff and hard to insert cards.  Zipper positioning is wearing out materials in the corners too easily, making the wallet looks rather worn out for the inside very easily (outside is OK).  The inside is large enough for me slip in my Galaxy S4 with space to spare.",0
5,I liked the quality of the necklace.  It was a gift to myself as a first time mom.,1
3,The dress did fit as expected and has a higher cut for a typical sweetheart cut dress. The only reason it did not work for me is that the color is more of a red wine and less of a true burgundy. I had ordered it for a wedding that required me to wear a more burgundy color as a bridesmaid. So if color is not an issue for you then this dress would be great for you. True in size.,0
3,Love the style and color but small for the size I ordered. If I had been a bit bigger in the bust it would not have fit.,0
5,Excelent quality,1
5,"Looks really good and shinny, I bought it for my dad he really liked it and wears it a lot!",1
5,Love it.. Looks like little shoes while my baby has them on,1
2,"I took the gloves out of the package and the Velcro strap just fell off ,they are not good quality and pretty disappointing overall :(",0
5,I have ordered this product twice because I loved the suttle pink colors which match my tattoos that r pink as well.,1
5,"I love the quality of the material nice feel and fit..The price was amazing, I bought three.",1
4,Slightly snug but fit and price was reasonable.,1
1,Ordered 2 and both broke on first use.,0
5,Got this sweater for my daughter. She loves it. Hardly see here with it off.,1
5,I love these boots. I wear size 8 and purchased that exact size and it fits perfectly. They are comfortable and very cute. The only thing is that on hard wood floors you may slip a little bit because of the heel. So walk carefully.,1
4,"Cute pair of socks well printed & easy to see/read. I like the larger sizing options, as I bought these for a friend who has a hard time finding cute socks in her size.",1
4,"Love this necklace! I did hope it would sparkle a little more, but still...it’s super cute and trendy.",1
5,Great party favors,1
5,"Soft and comfortable, good grip",1
1,"Very cheaply made, the light covers kept falling off and I was not doing anything over the top- drinking and sitting for our ugly sweater party. The hats were very cheaply made and looked cheap. Not impressed:",0
1,Looks cool but pretty crappily built and very hard to fix the band when it breaks.,0
4,Comfortable for summer. Reasonable price,1
3,"based on price, not so bad",0
1,"Even though this is only $8, it's not even worth that. First one came broken, second one broke on the 1st day I wore it. Save your money.",0
2,Fit poorly. It also had a frumpy shape that was very unflattering.,0
1,"Beautiful pearls for crocs, but horrible.  They all came apart as you are putting them in the hole of the crocs.  Had to go out of my way and buy gorilla glue in order to out them all together.  Will see if they stay if not will be returning.  The stubs they used are bigger than the crocs holes.",0
1,Dress hem was sewn onto top and I was unable to undo it.  Shoddy work on a really pretty costume,0
2,Very unflattering. I ordered my usual size and the dress hugged every problem area and was too short. I returned immediately.,0
3,"Band is a lot lighter than the actual picture represents, it's more of a nude/faded blush pink color. It feels soft, it was easy enough to change the band and its fits well. Now let's see how well it holds up.",0
5,My five year old daughter loves the socks especially since they go over the knee and they've been great for this winter season especially when she wears them underneath her leggings very comfortable very soft and very cute definitely will order again. And she really loves the different types of animals on them!,1
2,It’s beautiful and the fabric is nice but it was a bit bigger than i anticipated,0
5,Love it! Use it when I work out.,1
1,I have not even had the watch ban for a month and the design is already wearing off. ☹️🙁,0
5,Love them! Can't wait for the baby to arrive,1
2,I liked the mask but because the filters was not in it the mask was hard to breath in it I kept the mask an got my own filter which mean they kept my money I blame Amazon because it said with filters I thought the filters came with the mask,0
5,Bought for niece's birthday she loved them,1
3,I had to order up a size. Runs a little small. It did not arrive with a belt.,0
3,Tiny. Pendant fell off after a month and a half...,0
5,Love these!,1
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!! I just received it and you can tell it was an item that someone else had returned and they had the  nerve to send it to me. The package was open, IT DOESN'T WORK, and the inside of the belly ring was actually burnt.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY  THIS ITEM!!<br />I had to give 1 star to submit my review but it gets NO STARS from me",0
2,Cute suit but not for anyone who is busty. Will be returning. The top part of this is extremely small. Bought an large based on previous reviews.. fits like an xs on top. 5'2 130 34dd,0
5,"These are great house shoes, get them, they are worth it...",1
5,"Soft, ribbed-sweater material. I’m 5’7 140 lbs and the small fits perfect.",1
3,"There is a fabric lining inside of this shoes. Very not practical for toddler's shoes and gets dirty all the time, difficult to clean.",0
1,"It's square. I bought a medium and I've average in size. It's as wide as it is long, which is not typical. It's extremely unflattering and comes up short so it sits at high on the hip - even more unflattering. It's like a more cropped crop top and makes me look significantly heavier than I am.",0
5,Very pretty just a little tight around the arms,1
3,These straps are hardy and fashionable but I have had them slide off my eyeglasses occasionally so my glasses are hanging on with one strap.,0
5,"Love, love this key chain....",1
4,They are beautiful but they look a bit big. But I have gotten compliments on them. So it's really up to you if you like big sun glasses.,1
5,I bought them for my daughter good quality,1
5,Love the flow and the cut. Doesn't have any gaps under my arms that I experience sometimes with having to order up in sizing.,1
1,Very Cheaply made see thru and looks like it will fall apart!,0
2,Heavier with liner I was not expecting from a “lightweight” jacket,0
5,I love them.,1
5,Great quality. My son is two years old and loves walking in the slippers. You don’t need socks it’s comfortable as is. He’s a size 7 and sneakers so the size I got him fits him perfect. I got him size 7/8.,1
2,"These rings rust and turn your fingers green. The whole ring tarnishes after just a week. They lied about being silver, they are very cute though.",0
3,Not as bright of colors I had thought it would be. Bought for my girlfriend so I won’t be wearing it but in my hands feels really soft and warm a little on thin side overall I’m happy with purchase just colors aren’t as bright as the picture,0
1,"These are Chinese sizes, order at least 3 sizes above what you normally wear",0
1,Does not retain any shape at all. It did for a day and is sad looking now.,0
1,"Item was not new when  received,  that not a safe practice during a pandemic...smh",0
3,"The dress is huge! I’m thinking I will return it. I ordered an xl, I am usually a l-xl. A medium probably would have fit well. I was not looking for a tight dress and I definitely didn’t get one. It’s seriously double the size I would need. Overall it’s okay. The top seems a bit see through. There’s so much fabric from below the chest that it can not be see through.",0
4,Cute. But didn't fit right.,1
5,Cute and fits well. Not to heavy of material.,1
5,Beautiful! Absolutely love it it’s just start out jewelry to teach my daughter to take care of her things but it’s beautiful!!,1
2,"I usually wear a medium, these were too tight and the elasticity isn't too good but tight fit. I have purchased the pocket and just fitness type shorts and leggings for 2 years now. It's all I wear is stretch leggings/shorts. These are the very first not to fit right. The tightness alone especially at bottom hem line, squeezed my knees. All pairs I purchased did not fit so it's the make themselves. They cost a pretty penny so its not so great when they don't fit right. Not for me.",0
5,It holds a lot of stuff while still snapping shut. It's colorful and well made. I have had several compliments on it. I would most definitly buy from this seller again.,1
5,"Comfortable, very nice shoe!",1
3,I think the watch is fine but it is NOT lime!  The color is what threw me.  Like a pea green or mint.  The picture shows more lime than it really is.,0
3,When I first received the necklace it seemed to be ok but it's changed to an odd yellowish color.,0
2,"The box was nice, although the links themselves left a bit to be desired.  They had come polished, but with scratches on them.  I have worn them once a week since I got them, and they are showing dull and beat up.  Would  not order again, but they worked for something cheap in a pinch",0
2,"Runs big. I’m 205, 5’4” and XL was too big",0
2,"I didn’t have high expectations for this bodysuit, but I went ahead and purchased it anyways. Sadly I was right, but I guess you do get what you payed for. First of all the body suit was too short for my body so it didn’t even snap. I would get a bigger size but then the rest of it would have been a bit too loose. Second, the material is very, very, thick and cheap. I’m giving it two stars because it’s not completely unwearable but it wasn’t worth the money for me.",0
4,"I'm 5'4&#34; and the dress came to about my knee area, so it was a pretty modest dress. Still lovely though, probably most ideal for some young women or girls who are trying to find something that makes them feel pretty without feeling objectified or uncomfortable. When it comes to the dress itself, the material was stretchy and seemed a bit flimsy. The top of the dress was very comfortable and made me feel very secure. The straps are broad and comfortable, and they won't slip off. The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because the thinner material made the dress not as formal as I was expecting it to be. This dress would be good for a winter/Christmas vocal or instrumental performance, or for a night out.",1
5,"Love this bag.  At first it seemed too small but it turned out to be the perfect size.  I love that it is lined to protect from moisture and that it has so many pockets.  It is well made, dare I say heavy duty built?  Only time will tell but i really love this bag.  Get it, you’ll thank me for the purchase.",1
1,"By the zipper and fit, this is actually a women's sweater and not a men's.  I had to return it for a refund.",0
5,It's very nice. Better than expected.,1
5,I loved it!! Ring might be a bit big but I have small fingers but I still love it,1
4,I use these to go to the gym and wear around the house.  They are light and comfortable with a relaxed fit.  I'm normally 35x31 and they fit great (L).  Not too long.  I got the solid black and you definitely can't see through them.  Internal drawstring is long enough and the open bottom is what I wanted.  Not five stars because the pockets are small - okay for car keys but not an iPhone.  Wish they were available in other solid colors (navy and grey/silver).,1
2,Not at all what I wanted. The material is weird and it can’t be tumble dried. That being said it is cute (which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1). Unfortunately I already washed it so I can’t return it now...,0
5,"I purchased as a costume accessory, and I admit he was surprised and super enticed. The gloves have plenty of stretch to them. I have small hands and thick fingers. However, the farther up my arms they reach they feel awfully tight, especially above the elbow. I am hoping that after multiple uses, they will stretch and not feel too tight.",1
2,"Cute design, something different. There's not much swing to the dress - it just sort of falls and clings. The material is not what i expected.  We hit 100 degree plus days during the summer, and i think i would feel the heat in this. Also, purchase a larger size - it runs small. I gave it to my friend's daughter.",0
5,"I was skeptical about these but they are fantastic! They stay in place, they are comfy, and they can stand up to the washing machine and dryer.  I would highly recommend. - Justin's wife.",1
1,"This material is awful! It’s super itchy. I have no idea why because there’s  nothing on it to make it scratchy. But believe me. It is. I didn’t realize it was itchy until I was out the door headed to work. I scratched the entire day! It was so uncomfortable! I was miserable. I couldn’t wait until my work day ended. I literally wanted to take the dress off after work and just drive home naked. Yes, it was THAT bad. Do not buy this dress!",0
1,"I ordered 5 size mediums and 2 size larges all in the color khaki, the larges are a different color then the mediums for whatever reason. I need all of them to match considering I bought them for my bridesmaids. So is there any way they can be exchanhed for the correct color so they match?",0
2,Too short,0
3,"It's really cute but it's bigger than I hoped it be it also has a pretty long chain and it flips around a lot,the jems look like they are about to fall out but since they are not I guess it is a pretty cool necklace",0
3,Very cheap material....you get what you pay for. I ordered a medium and it was true to size. Also the print was off center and just felt weird to me. I returned this item but overall it's not bad for the price.,0
5,I love this necklace set. Great price.  Thank you.  Good quality.,1
3,Very thin socks,0
3,"Love these little hats but even as a newborn they were tight on my little girl's head. She was an average sized baby, under 8 pounds but they were tight and she fussed if I put them on her. They are really cute though. They kind of fade if you wash them and they are a little different in color than pictured in my opinion.",0
3,I received the wrong size.,0
5,"I ordered this pack to give away to graduating seniors. I am a school teacher, and I am often invited to many graduation parties. I ordered the three pack and then gave one single bracelet to three different girls. Each of them loved the bangle, and I received many compliments on the gifts. I do not know how they will hold up long term.",1
1,I ordered this shirt in white and I’m very disappointed because it is very transparent. The fit is also a bit larger than I expected. Overall the quality is subpar.,0
1,Broke the first day I got it. Poorly made and would not recommend anyone to purchase it. If you do you will be sorry.,0
5,"I purchased these for comfort during my CIU. They are wonderful, flowing garments perfect for limited skin contact. Even now that my hives are finally getting to be under some measure of control thanks to Xolair, these make terrific summertime sleeping shifts.",1
5,Nice Jacket - great fit XXL I’m 6’6” tall. I was in the Golf business for 10 years & I know Sun Mountain makes quality products. Yes the Zipper is plastic - I don’t want a Metal Zipper on a Rain Jacket in a lightning storm - it’s rugged & can be worn on or off the golf course. I’ve worn it several times so far & no problems. I’d buy another of the same in a heartbeat. 5 STARS !,1
3,"Nice quick wallet, but not effective in RFID blocking. I put my work badge in this wallet as well and the badge reader could still read the badge.",0
2,Cute if you don't look too closely. A little cheap looking.,0
3,I like the style very much but the material was quoted as ‘cotton’ and it is 95% poly!!!! That means it will ball up quickly. The zipper is very cheap also.,0
4,Very cute but not that warm and fingers are just slightly too long for me,1
3,Too big,0
3,beautiful but not durable. the edges are already cracking in less than a few months,0
1,"save your money, this is not worth it",0
4,Great basic nice and soft stretchy elastic short.  Ordered the 8-9 for a little extra room but still had the fit of a girls med 7-8 . Pink was slightly see through. Good shorts for the right size,1
3,As expected,0
1,"Unfortunaley the blouse runs very small, so if you are a plus size, keep this in mind",0
1,Tunic arrived with hole in it. I'm upset because I really like the shirt,0
2,sent it back,0
1,"I've had these bracelets for month but just haven't had the chance to wear them often at all. I wore the leopard cuff w the gold balls  just 4/5 times before it broke. I think I can tuck it in and glue it, but I wasn't expecting a DIY project when I bought it.<br /><br />The one star is for the other bracelet that is still intact, but then again, I've only worn it once.",0
4,Runs a little smaller,1
1,"After 30 minutes of trying to fit the pins into the band, I decided to send it back. It would not work.",0
1,Here is what the shoes look like after a second day of wear.  They frayed and looked fuzzy after the first wear.  They are cheap and not worth the money that I paid for them.  This is a rip-off.  Don’t waste your money!,0
5,cute shirt,1
5,Cleveland rocks...at least this year.  Go Browns,1
3,"Very reflective, but on the small side. Would not wear this on a windy day.",0
1,I am 5ft 7 with 38D chest and normally wear an XL and this top was ridiculously tiny.,0
1,It seems they are toy,0
5,This outfit is so precious!! Size 4,1
3,"I do wish it was longer in the center, but I am tall, so I get why it isn't . . .",0
2,"Doesn't look like in the picture, (cheaper look in real life)  Where the seam is (at the bust ) sticks out too much, making what you want to wear with it very limiting. Need to return.",0
5,"I bought this dress for Easter, wanting something different. The fabric is stretchy enough yet has a structured feel to it. I got so many compliments on it, I'll be wearing it to a wedding later this summer!",1
3,I got an XL and it fits more like M-L. Cute style. Returning item.,0
4,These are just what I expected.  They were great party favors for my daughter's birthday.,1
5,Our son always has problems with rash guard tops coming up over his belly. We love these one piece suits for him! This one is fantastic. Made well. Fits great. And it’s adorable,1
1,Realmente no funciona como se espera. Ni bien sudas un poquito se empieza a despegar todo.,0
5,"I just received my new gloves, they r wonderful! I luv the way they look & feel!! I highly recommend them!!! Thx so much!!! ;-) ;-)",1
1,Cheaply made they may have been OK to store around the house but I was afraid I would fall on them and I just had surgery so I sent them back they are cute,0
4,Fits good in comperison with other shoes I ordered on same order,1
5,These work amazing. Bought them for my husband to wear while snowblowing our sidewalks!,1
5,"Had one huge stain on my white shoes, only used one wipe and managed to take out the stain!",1
3,I really love the fit and feel of the socks. However I ordered colors that I did not get.,0
4,great product,1
2,Good costume prop but thats about it.,0
5,"Great baselayer glove that has enough warmth for casual use such as driving, running, etc. I'm a huge fan of Arc'teryx products which is why I'll pay a premium for basics like these gloves. They fit really well and have the finger pads on the index and thumb fingers to use your smartphone without taking them off. For extreme conditions, I pair these with the BD Mercury Mitts and they work nicely together.",1

5,I thought this was cotton but it's not its like a nice athletic material very happy surprise!,1
2,"Lengthwise, it was a bit short. The breast &#34;cups&#34; were too low for me, so i cut holes in it to remove them. It fit a little better after, but still a bit small.",0
1,Broke after I wear it for 2 times,0
1,Way to small to fit a man's head.  Also too expensive to ship back.,0
5,He love it,1
5,Perfect!,1
5,great product and came as promised,1
5,Perfect for my 5-year-olds and Encanto birthday party!,1
1,Very thin. Well not keep you warm. And  looks nothing like the pic,0
3,"Does not look like it does in picture, also the stones are not even placed correctly in the holder for it, I will give to my niece to play with instead of wearing this myself. Looks as if It came out of a gumball machine. Not happy at all.",0
3,"Workmanship and fabric was great. But the size is way off. Very short waisted.  I am 5 ft 6 in and 132 lbs normally wear a small, 6-8 in a dress, I had to wear the large.",0
5,It fits so well and looks really good and I'm interested in buying another one. I love that it is made out of lycra and that the front part is flexible and can get wet. My only wish is that it came in more colors but I plan on wearing it as often as I can and looks fairly sturdy and well made.,1
1,"This material was so thin and see-through that the shirt was unwearable, even with an undershirt. Not at all as pictured. Maybe this was a knock-off? The darker colors were okay, but the white is a big no-go, unless you're in to showing off your anatomy. Despite the misleading photo, the seller still did not cover return shipping. The description of their return policy said ""free returns,"" but apparently that meant free to them. Weeks after the seller had received my return, I still had to badger them for a refund before they issued the credit. After covering the shipping cost and the couple months of headache that the whole ordeal demanded, I will definitely not be purchasing in the future.",0
5,Very soft and cute. I very happy with product and transaction.,1
1,I could not fasten it to save my life.  Returning it today.,0
1,"Cheap material, too small...ended up returning it",0
5,Very soft and breathable socks.,1
4,"The t shirt and these pants go sooo good together, i also had to wear the latex undies also, let me tell you boy! I felt as if those sexy boys were lookin at my package, 😉.😗",1
5,"of all my tops, this is my favorite. It is loose and perfect according to my size. It has an opening on the shoulder that gives a modern and fashion touch. I bought the black one and it makes me look thinner. I recommend it, it shows the body with curves. I received it today and I already used it",1
4,Runs large,1
1,I can't believe how very small these run.  I am returning for refund,0
2,"It did come immediately, which was nice. Pretty easy to return.",0
1,Leaves you cold and out of money. I used this vest twice. The first time was to try it out and try it on. Lasted for 10 min maybe. Hung it up and charged the battery. The first real time wearing it i noticed it wasnt really that warm. I went to turn it up and found it wouldnt even turn on. Took the battery pack out and saw it was empty after 3 hours on low. Tried to charge it with there charger and it wouldnt charge. Just got hot on the top. Waste of money. Guess ill just be cold and wait and hope to get my money back.,0
5,Haven't used a lot yet but appears to be a very good umbrella for the money.,1
3,Best Quality is not its best characteristic! The lenses where out of place since I opened it.,0
5,AWESOME FOR A TEEN BOY AS A GIFT - EVERYTHING YOU WILL THINK IT WOULD BE. I BOUGHT THE LONGEST LENGTH AND MY SON LOVES IT. WELL WORTH THE $$,1
1,"Received the wrong style and had to send it back, very disappointed!",0
4,The color of these earrings are wonderful. They are a very rich emerald green. I like very much.,1
3,"I gave 3 stars because half the sleeves were a different brand that were too tight for my husband to wear.  He didn't notice until he had already worn two pairs (so we couldn't return them).  Half of them have a written brand on them and the other half don't.  And half have a very tight upper arm seam.  As you can see in the photo,  the ones with the brand name are shorter,  tighter,  and don't have the finger slot (even though the photo on Amazon shows all of them having finger slots).  I assume someone must have switched them out (maybe a return or something). But unfortunately,  my husband had used several before we saw the difference,  so cannot return.",0
1,I ordered a size XL it was more like a med.. very disappointed gave to my daughter who wears size 8,0
5,Look amazing when it came in but it is a little heavy make sure you pin it to something that can hold it.,1
4,"hilarious.  8 y/o son says it's too itchy, so idk how much use he'll actually get out of it<br />took FOREVER to get",1
2,Way too small for xxl the arms fit way too small,0
3,This will keep you warm but not a stylish as it looks in pictures,0
3,Colores deficientes,0
3,"The shirt runs small. I can usuall wear a large in men's and it will be very loose like I prefer. This however ran small and is snug and uncomfortable. Poor investment, cheaply made. I kept it because it was the only shirt I have seen that wasn't a T-shirt. It was expensive and cheaply made. nade,",0
3,Not as magnetic as I thought,0
3,Super cute but run really small!,0
1,The color was cheap looking and the posts were too large to use.,0
3,Very nice. But it came with a hole on its pocket and a hole on the crotch area. But my aunt fixed it.,0
1,Very small bought for my hubby and they were to tight on his head so I tried em and I have a tiny head and they were to small for me as well :(,0
4,It is a Christmas gift don’t know the answer,1
5,Very simple and pretty.,1
2,Nope,0
5,Great wallet - perfect size and great quality,1
4,Works great for everyday use and cleans easily after working out,1
5,There very comfortable,1
5,Hermoso justo como en la foto,1
5,"Great wristlet! Love this little wristlet! It is small enough not to be a bother but big enough to hold my phone, keys, lipgloss and the best part, it has slots for my id and credit cards! The gold detail around the top and handle is very pretty. I have iPhone 6s and this holds it in the case with plenty of room. You could put a 6 plus in here as well.",1
4,Son loves it.,1
5,it is beautiful on my ankle.,1
5,I loved it.  I wore it to a Foreigner concert and lost it.  AAAAAAAAAUGH !  I will be getting another one!,1
1,I received one size 9 shoe and one size 10.,0
3,"I'm busty so I should've known, but this thing is too small for me. Still cute though, so I wear it over another bra.",0
1,"Cheap, looks worse than dollar store product!",0
5,Thanks for such prompt shipping and tour good quality product!,1
1,I was excited because immediately to the eye this necklace is beautiful. However i went to tie it on my neck for my first use and it completely fell apart from the straps. I wont lie this is a pretty necklace but its not secure enough to stay together,0
1,Looks great but the shoe sizes run small.,0
5,Fit perfectly in my purse for international travel with the ease of not having to search for passport or IDs,1
5,Bought this for my sons they loved it .they never leave the house without it,1
4,Bday gift,1
3,I ordered two of. These necklaces and was very disappointed with the poor quality.,0
5,"Is a perfect fit, awesome price! Was worried that it was a cheap ring that it would turn my finger green but it has not! So pleased!",1
2,Smaller in size.,0
2,They are NOT ruby they are purple.. uploaded picture next to matching earings from same seller,0
3,"My son loves Doge and was excited to get this, it does have kind of a chemical smell",0
3,The mesh is discoloring kind of bummed about this<br />Not sure what to clean it with,0
5,Definitely worth the money when boutiques are selling $10 each,1
5,This set is adorable!<br />Much more than expected!<br />Fast shipping!<br />Great seller!,1
1,The product and price were agreeable and I ordered it in plenty of time to receive it for my trip.  It never arrived and when I returned from my trip I inquired directly to the company and they said they sent an e-mail explaining that it was NO LONGER AVAILABLE and that my credit card would be credited.  I went back to check my e-mail log and no e-mail was ever received by them.  I would order at least 2 1/2 months prior to your need to avoid this problem.,0
5,The only thing that could be better is if I did not have to provide the chain! This piece is gorgeous color and it is natural I had my local gem store look at it along with other purchases.,1
5,Great purse with plenty of room!  looks expensive and I get lots of compliments on color and style,1
2,"These shipped quickly.  I did find them to be a bit small. If you plan on ordering, order up one size.  I was also disappointed that they are fading quickly in the wash.",0
5,"Nice quality, pleasingly surprised",1
4,"This is absolutely a beautiful piece of jewelry.  My only problem is that it is light weight and moves around on my neck a bit. One of my colleagues was very positive about that and said that it represented birds flying.  Touche!  It is really lovely.  I wish it was just a little bit heavier.  The birds symbolize my mother and me, so that's all that matter.  The quality is excellent, and I do love it very much!<br /><br />Update:  The birds are beautiful.  I do wish that the chain was a bit heavier, but one thing I noticed (not previously) is that the chain has an extender piece!  At this length, the birds stay centered and in place.  I love it dearly as I did my mom.",1
5,"This product is average in quality. Considering low price, overall good",1
5,They make taking your boots off a breeze!,1
3,The wallet is nice however there is only room for 4 cards (that includes your drivers licence). You can put a small amount of paper money in it but more than a few bills and it causes the bills to buckle.  It has a nice zippered compartment for change.  When I tried to put a pen in it then it wouldn't snap it  closed.  It is a very flat wallet.  Bacisly you will either really like it or you won't.  I wouldn't buy it again.,0
1,Arrived promptly heavier than expected gems fell off after wearing twice very upset about that.plus they were attached on crooked.,0
3,"These are good for keys that are not used much. They are plastic so it seems like they might break easy. I bought them for my husband to put his shed key, lawn mower keys etc. A great way for the colors to let him know which key is what just by the color.",0
5,I didn't have any dislikes. It was great!,1
1,These ARE NOT blue light blocking! The lenses are completely clear as far as I can tell. Nor was the color as described. Ordered fuchsia and they were more like a maroon color.,0
1,"it lasted for a very short time and it already broke, I thought I had pulled it too hard but checking it is already breaking in other places",0
5,"Good quality, nice colors",1
5,This thing is fantastic. Its what I have needed for years and glad I have it.,1
3,Hangs low enough so it doesn't choke you,0
5,Christmas gift for my dad. He loves how warm it is.,1
3,I will just wear heavy socks,0
4,Nice bracelet. Just wish the magnet was stronger as the first one just came off during the day the first week I had it. I reordered as I like the style a lot but watch it constantly as the magnet is no stronger on the replacement.,1
3,These go clear to my arm pits I already have sleeves,0
5,Went great with my grey tuxedo,1
5,I have ordered similar products but these are the best for the price. I will order again,1
2,Band keeps popping off.  Good looking but not worth the money.  Spend a little more to get a good band.,0
5,"Um.. can you say OOW Oow!! This dress is a head Turner, if your going out and want to feel sexy this is the dress for you!",1
5,"You can really tell the difference when you use these Blue Light glasses. I sit at a desk staring at two sizeable computer monitors for work and these have helped a lot. They also came with two cases (a soft cloth case and a firmer leather case), and a cleaning cloth.",1
1, ,0
3,I thought it was more of a knit type material.,0
1,These glasses suck.,0
5,Hermoso!!,1
3,Fabric could be more substantial.,0
3,"They fit my 13 year old perfect, a little shorter than expected. However, they start to get cotton balls stuck to them after about 7 washes",0
2,"I really live this dress. Perfect color, fit great. Even though I hand washed and dried flat it fell apart after about 5 wears. And I and not rough on clothes.",0
5,"Love, love, love them.  They are warm and comfortable and wash and dry beautifully.  Thanks for a great product!",1
5,Love it,1
5,Cute holder to keep business cards in my purse.,1
5,"These furry house shoes are amazing! Very soft, really comfortable, and true to size. Perfect for slipping on and off while in the house, definitely recommend!",1
1,Arrived broken and the white checkered part looks like it was a white shirt that got stuck in the load of red laundry.,0
3,Leggings look great and pocket is just what I needed...but they don't stay up!  Just walking around and they slip down.  Not sure what will happen when working out.,0
5,"The quality is good, I was pleasantly surprised. It is light weight and comfortable. The fabric does not look cheap at all. Good price for a good product.",1
1,Too tight. V was pretty low. Sent back.,0
5,So cute. My babysitter loved her holiday gift. Happy we got it at such a great price. I kind of want one myself.,1
3,"The lenses were a little more square than they appear. Mine came with a couple scratch mark right at eye level which are annoying. They don't darken much, which is fine unless you're in a very bright area. Other than that, they fit and look good.",0
1,I bought this as a Mother's Day gift - unfortunately its way too small.,0
3,I bought a medium which is my normal size but this shirt fits me like it’s an xl and has store smell to it like vinegar and chemicals. The shirt looks exactly how it does in the picture though which is the good thing. So I will be washing it to get rid of the smell and hopefully it shrinks a bit when dried,0
1,Broke the third time I wore it.,0
5,couldn't get it in larger size in time,1
1,Received the wrong dress!  The wrong dress was black -- that was the only similarity!  So bummed because I needed it ASAP for a special occasion.  Had to return it and wear something I already had.,0
2,These look like cheap costume material. The quality is just sad.,0
5,"I like these and for the price, great!",1
3,Kind of a weird shape and pretty cheap fabric.,0
4,"if you really want feel the cooling effect, submerse the helmet in water for a few minutes. Then let drip for a few more. I believe the British troops used to do this. The evaporative cooling will give you brain freeze.",1
1,Necklace was broken. Otherwise was pretty,0
3,"Very pretty, much smaller than expected.  The CZ didn't have as much sparkle as I would have liked to see.  Good value for a person with very small lobes or a child.",0
1,"Way too small, even when I ordered the largest size possible it's then too short, ripped when I tried pulling it above my chest :(",0
3,Love the color. True to picture. The T-shirt was way too long and too tight. Bought my normal size. Too tight. Definitely size up for a regular but not too lose fit through the body but will then be even longer. Too much material to tuck in for someone if average height.,0
5,Bang for your buck! This timepiece is a beautiful one for sure. Great build quality.,1
5,totally like this swetshirt,1
5,"These are awesome, comfortable, stylish and right on trend!",1
3,Color washes out light skin,0
5,Very cute,1
4,I'm 5'7&#34; and about 145lbs and a size large fit me very well. I had to get a backless/strapless bra and a pair of spanx to wear it but for the price that's worth it. The material is a bit heavy but not so much that you feel like it is weighing you down. I probably couldn't wear heels with it because then the front would look too short but flats should look good.,1
4,I like it. It's warm and looks cute.,1
2,The appearance of the print is as described but a thin and light t-shirt for a premium price ... I don't think it'll hold up well to wash and wear ... I do not recommend it,0
5,Very beautifully crafted,1
5,"Honestly, I wish I had kept a picture of the ears, but they arrived me in perfect packaging and in perfectly good condition. I was very pleased with them. They fit me comfortably, and they lasted me for a whole night of partying on Halloween. They even survived that. LOL I think I'll keep them around a while.<br />The ears do appear to be glued on, by the way, so I wouldn't recommend washing them. Perhaps it would be best, in that case, to spot clean them.",1
5,These are great. I find this type of mask so much easier to use.  Very comfortable and I love that it has the pocket inside and came with a filter.  Highly recommend,1
1,"BEWARE. These are fake. Please don't waste your money on cheap plastic junk with incorrect colors, rough edges and backing that says things like 'frist release'",0
3,Very cute dress but runs small.,0
5,"Fun item, good quality, and Yes, I would order it again.",1
5,I use it to play cricket.,1
1,These run small and did not fit properly... Can't return them so threw them away. A complete waste.,0
5,I really like this purse/cross bag. I use it to carry everything I use it to carry my cigarettes in the front pocket many credit cards insurance cards and so on keys and phone in the other pocket the three pockets are the greatest only wish it was just a tad smaller and would like for it to have a wrist handle but it didn't come with that just the long handle to put crossed your body but overall it is very back very good quality.,1
3,"These are not the best quality and fit a little small, but my grand daughter loves them",0
5,"Very good quality, great sparkle, great value.  I would tell everyone that is looking for great crystal jewelry don't hesitate in buying this product.  Will fit a 7.5-7.75 wrist.",1
1,"Tastes decent for sugar free but what’s the use, it raised my blood sugar from 100 to 200 in about 30 minutes. Took another 2 hours to get back into a safe range. I don’t even think regular sugar would raise my blood sugar that high considering the small amount I used. I emailed ChocZero’s customer service and they coud give a crap less. Basically told me I’m an extremely rare case and offered nothing else in return. If you’re diabetic or on some other low carb diet, i.e. keto etc I would steer clear of this product.",0
3,"I bought these Capri pants for travel nightwear.  Found they are significantly heavier than my cotton Capri pjs, so thank God, I didn’t take them to Europe with me. Biggest factor was that it takes two runs in the dryer to get dry. I had hoped to be able to hand wash and line dry so I’d only need one set of pjs on trips.  If I line dry these, it takes TWO DAYS! to dry whereas Everything Else is dry in one day.  They are great for workouts and strenuous chores, wicks well.  Also nice pjs at home; I just have to be sure to put them in the first wash load so they can dry in two loads.",0
1,Looks nothing like the picture highly disappointed!!!! The pants look like my gym teachers pants back in the 80s definitely not leggings,0
2,"Beware. Image was not centered on shirt. Very noticeable when I tried it on. Then even though it says free returns, it’s not. I have to return through a carrier of my choice and they will only refund $4 even though it costs more than that to return. I do not recommend buying this.",0
4,Hat was as expected,1
1,I got a small and it is huge. This hits like any ol free shirt I have been given. It is not cute at all. I will never wear it.,0
3,It was cute but has this weird white piece in the upper side. The photo in the ad has it under the purse straps 😒,0
1,Cheap made .,0
1,wore twice for about an hour and a half both times. they look like they are at the end of there life already. im 115 lbs so really they shouldnt look like this already. the sole is flattened and also the fit is hard since the heel part swings around every step you take. we had to velcro it almost sideways just so they would stay on straight. i guess this is a semi common problem with these after reading some other reviews.,0
5,Beautiful dragonfly. Wife loved it.,1
3,They are good quality so far and comfortable but they don’t really offer any support for even medium activity. They are good for lounging if you’re just looking for comfort and not high intensity support.,0
5,quick delivery and just as described.,1
4,"I was happy with this product. The only thing was, that it was delivered past the due date (but I ordered it early in case that would happen). Other than that, everything was great!",1
5,This shirt fit me perfectly!!,1
5,awesome goes with so much,1
3,I bought the XS and it literally fit me like a dress.  I wore it over tight leggings and decided to keep because I love what it says. I get a lot of laughs whenever I wear this puts me in a better mood.,0
1,too small,0
2,Didn’t include a fish.,0
4,"Both pairs of these arrived with no damage, broken parts, nor did they need any minor repairs.  They are each packaged in there own boxes.  They are very long when worn and both pairs have the open hook backs.  I had no ear lobe swelling, no tarnish marks, or no irritations when wearing.  The weight is pretty light for a longer earring and after about 8 hours I was happy to take them out.",1
2,"While this shirt is long enough and very soft, the sizing is way off. I usually wear a comfortable Lg. This shirt hugged every roll and was see through in the XL. I could never wear it out in public. Way too tight.",0
4,love it! Definitely a big tshirt night shirt,1
4,"Good quality, fits as it should.",1
1,Bought for Halloween. Zipper teeth fell off when trying to unzip.<br />Fun decent hoodie but doesn't have the same effect if it can't be zipped up now.<br /><br />Thin lightweight hoodie. Graphics look good.,0
1,"Way too small, it fit my daughter good though, so we kept it.",0
4,So far so good. Ordered the small<br />Update-the black fades quickly after washing,1
5,"Love the jacket, first thought to small. But worked out.",1
5,my bf loves them,1
1,Incredibly cheap - the white shirt was merely a couple inches of fabric attached to the also cheaply made red suit. Way overpriced.,0
1,These are worse than costumes quality. Construction of garment was terrible. Zero stars if I could. Return was not easy...,0
1,"Nearly impossible to see the writing on the ring. The lettering isn’t in black, but in a silvery/translucent color. The writing also doesn’t look like the ring in the film but looks very poorly done. Ring is very cheap feeling. Will be sending back immediately.",0
5,"I LOVE THIS NECKLACE!! :D it's adorable, matches so many things, and is all around just gorgeous, especially considering that it is such an inexpensive price!<br />I would recommend this to any of my friends! :))",1
1,"Uncomfortable hurts my wrist, you get what you pay for",0
3,It’s pretty. Not very flattering for those with larger hips. It’s made pretty well. It’s ok... to,0
5,Bought it as a gift for a friend and she loved it ! Amazing product !,1
5,Replacement. Love them.,1
5,Quick delivery and good as expected!,1
5,cannot go wrong with Bruce Lee,1
5,Loved these,1
1,"The shirt we received looks nothing like the one shown in the picture. We thought we were receiving a dark heather gray shirt with a nice fit for a woman. Instead, we received a shirt that is a very light gray almost white with a terrible fit. It looks very cheaply made.",0
3,Nice pants. Sizing is weird.,0
2,"I like the material and all the storage....however as we were packing my husbands suit BOTH zippers popped right off. Shoddy zipper job. It still worked, just wont close. Get what you pay for, I guess.",0
2,too too large,0
5,Great quality mask-I love it! The face is cute with nice big deer eyes and the horns are realistic. I can’t say if it’s comfortable to wear or not since I’m using it for a Christmas yard display.  Very good quality for this price.,1
5,Very nice top. Good quality. Washed on gentle with good outcome. Extremely flattering. I kept the black one. The ivory showed lumps and bumps.,1
2,Dress looks great and fits ok. However the fabric feels very uncomfortable. Fabric feels like a water resistant table cloth.,0
2,"I already owned a pair of anti glar/ computer readers so these were purchased as a second pair.  Since the price was far less than what I paid for a previous pair, decided to purchase them. Very disappointed in that there is no comparison as these do not appear to be anti glare glare. The work well as regular reading glasses. Not worth the trouble of returning.",0
1,The shirt feels weird and silky almost? Not much stretch or give and not super comfortable to be honest.,0
1,Very disappointed in this product. Very cheaply made. And it keeps sliding on the eye glass bows.,0
2,"Love the case but the neck strap came apart after just 2 weeks. A big disappointment, as I had to buy something else right away to replace this one.",0
1,"Very overpriced and ineffective. These are not substantial enough for cold weather, they are very thin and I noticed no difference with these worn over my gloves. Also, there is a grip ""hole"" in the palm which was unclear in the listing - the entire palm is missing. The palm hole also prevents the glove from helping warm your hands. The way listing is setup currently you can't pick a size either. I buy a lot on Amazon and this is probably the most disappointed I've been in years. I would have returned them, but I foolishly thought I would try them even with the thin material and palm hole. They were ineffective and a waste of money.",0
5,Great product,1
3,THe watch is good but the strap is too short,0
5,Got it for my step daughter she loved it,1
2,"It's stylish but not practical. The mechanical skeleton blends in with the clock hands or vice versa, making them hard to see.",0
2,When putting on I noticed a tare at the seam was at bottom would’ve been covered up but definitely not happy about it,0
3,Good stockings but the sizes are smaller than marked.,0
2,Tarnished,0
2,I returned it because the pockets were right on my boobies,0
1,"Extremely thin, see-through material. Not at all the right expected size. It couldn't even be tied around the front - I ordered a large and I wear a US size 10 normally. Don't waste your money!",0
1,"Once installed, these springbars are impossible to remove from most modern watch cases. The dimensions are wonky. The springbars are very, very tight for the advertised lug width.<br /><br />The release edges are impossible to grab with a standard watch tool. The only ways to remove the springbars are drilling holes into the lugs, or sawing the springbars down.",0
5,"I haven’t ever been big busted, ever! Now that I gained quite a bit of weight, I grew a bust! But only because I got fat! I got a size large and it fits perfectly! I actually ordered several and love each of them! I wash them without the pads and put the pads back in after they air dry. They haven’t lost it’s elasticity or faded in color! Will buy more in the future! Definitely would recommend if your “girls” aren’t we’ll endowed.",1
5,My kid is extra fast in these.,1
1,"Just got these today and as soon as I took them out of the package and felt how thin they were, I was disappointed.  Then I compared them to a genuine Oakley lens and these flex and twist like they're half the thickness (and they kind of are).  I put them into the Oakley M frame and they fit fine.  Put the nose bridge on and right away can tell the sizing is off.  The bridge fits on there but the lens cutout for it is a bit longer.<br /><br />I'll update this and when I use them for riding within next day or so.  I don't think they will be very impact resistant at all though.  I already ordered a genuine Oakley replacement lens because this is the second generic replacement lens I tried and disappointed with.",0
3,"Works okay, doesn’t handle water that well.",0
5,Prefect fit for my ears and I can sleep with them in with no bother! Great investment for those who don’t like to change out earrings much!,1
1,"Shirt's misshapen, it doesn't contour to my body and is very uncomfortable around the arm pits when stretched",0
5,So pretty and ornate. Detailed very well.,1
5,"Love it, very comfortable",1
1,Poorly made they say one size fits all ! I order small and they are baggy,0
3,"This is a fun, bright color and pattern for summer. The fabric is very light weight and breathable. The dress itself is very comfortable.<br /><br />Sadly, I had to return it as I am 5'2"" and it drowned me. I would have had to wear heels the whole time and I don't want to. 🤷‍♀️",0
3,"I ordered the L/XL like I have from a few years ago....This one doesn't seem quite as big. I truthfully don't have a large head. I like to use after swimming in the colder weather. My hair is typically in a bun after swimming.  The other one covered my ears, but not this one....I feel like they adjusted their sizes...like the other size better...so did my ears :>",0
3,"I love the bag fashionable, small but big enough to carry your toiletries around. Few things to keep in mind, i putchased all my toiletries travel size abd they fit perfect. You may be able to place regular size toiletries but may run out of space quick.<br /><br />I love my bag. However, the reason for the 3 star is simply because the zippers on the inside were off track a bit and zipper stays open. The zippers on the side become a little hard to zip.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful.",0

1,"I really wanted to love these but ultimately there were too many little things that were off. The fabric is very thin and stretchy so you don’t get any of the usual support from a good pair of jeans. Maybe not a problem if you have six-pack abs, but if you even have the slightest of a belly pooch these jeans are going to accentuate it and give you a muffin top (I’m 5’6, 163 lbs and got the large). The pockets on the butt are also in the least flattering place. Or maybe they are too small. Either way, they make your butt look huge and not in a good TikTok leggings sort of way.",0
5,"It is a little awkward in length on me, but otherwise I really like it! (I am 5'8 for reference)",1
1,Very disappointed in this &#34;teal&#34; agate. Color is not even close to what is advertised. I've bought two previous stones and didn't think color would be an issue but this is completely false advertisement.,0
2,Not getting the color that was shown to us,0
1,The pants they sent me was very cheap looking. The slits that supposed be on the knee were uneven. One is higher then the other.  I got the burgundy pair and they were not high waist. Extremely disappointed. Sent back for refund.,0
2,Unless you have very large legs the pants are not form fitting around the calves as depicted.,0
5,"I got one pair for me, and one pair for a friend. We love them! Super cute.",1
3,"The color was way lighter than I ordered,  didnt look like picture at all",0
5,Everything as expected.,1
5,"Luv this dress! I dance and wen I saw this dress I had to have 😍 haha!! Perfect for twirling. Though I read the reviews about it running big, I ordered the size I normally wear (US Med) because I wanted room. Well, it was tooooo much room. So I altered by sewing a piece of ribbon under the bust to tie in the back to fit better. Now I want another (just different color / material 😁)",1
3,Cute but simple. The bottom half is plain and wrinkles easily.,0
2,The material is so super thin where the snaps are on the tail it rips when you try to unsnap it!!!! But it’s cute and my daughter was thrilled,0
5,"My daughter (7) wears them all the time, absolutely loves them. Was a little on the big size but she could wear them right away. a little loose around the ankle, so with low cut socks, rubs on skin and not super supportive to ankle, but again, she loves them.",1
5,love,1
1,This scarf looks pretty enough in the pictures but what you don't see is the other side of the scarf. I ordered a green Christmas scarf. The back side is white! So cheap looking that i am returning it immediately! it is not a true scarf fabric but more like a curtain panel. Definitely not worth the money. Buyer beware!,0
5,Good buy. I ordered grey and thats what i got. The picture is not accurate bc it looks like brown (on my phone).,1
4,"Bought this for my teen granddaughter,  she loves them, the look, the fit.",1
5,"Love, love, love it!",1
2,Pretty but too large.,0
5,Very good material 👍🏼,1
1,These earrings slide out. They do not stay in place because there is no c hook to stabilize them. Other earrings that have the c hook in the center stay perfectly in place. I returned them.,0
2,larger than expected,0
1,"I washed this bathing suit in a mesh bag, by itself, on the gentle cycle and the straps ripped off the top and the crotch ripped open. It was the first time I had worn/washed it. So disappointed.",0
3,"They never fit right. I kept waiting for my baby to fit into them but they always seemed too big until they were too small. The feet make them look big because they don't fit right around the ankles. It was difficult to put her shoes on so she  wore them without shoes most of the time. She wore them twice a week to our place of worship and on those days everyone thought she looked really cute in them with. The bows made them look really nice.<br />She wore them a lot for about 4 months and they still look new. I machine washed them inside out and put them in the dryer. One of the bows came off on one of them on the first day she wore them so I just  carefully cut the other bow off. The waist on these is really stretchy and she seemed very comfortable in them.<br />I think the material is very good quality. Never got any lint on them and they never faded. They are very soft and breathable but warm at the same time. Nice thickness on them. I really wish that they were better made around the feet though. That's the only thing that is keeping me from buying more. She just outgrew them after 4 months. The seems around the toes are very wide and they are very very baggy around the ankles. She outgrew them to the point where her butt was too big to still fit all the way inside the leggings and they were starting to feel tight around her legs and the feet were still too big.<br />I really hope that they fix this issue because other than the feet, they are great.",0
1,"This dress is really pretty, and it looks like the picture. It’s really comfortable and soft but it’s extremely short. I am 5’8 and was barely mid calf on me.",0
3,"Beautiful skirt and color in size S, but VERY short when worn at the waist like the picture. Granted, I'm taller at 5'9, but this skirt was about 5-6 inches off the ground and hit almost T-length on me. My mom who is 5'4&quot; even tried it on and it was still a couple inches from the ground.<br /><br />Picture can be pretty deceiving of the length. If you want it to look like the picture (floor length), you will probably need to be 5'2&quot; or less.",0
5,"I purchased this for my Pandora bracelet. It shines beautifully. I need to order another one, two or three. I also wear it on my silver chain necklace. I just love the sparkle.",1
3,"This jacket looks excellent - vibrant colors, no loose threads, and the patches are sewn on nicely.  The sizing definitely runs small - I normally wear a Large (6'2&#34; tall x 200 lbs) but had to send that back and request an XL.  So why only three stars?  Hmm. Two reasons - first, the quality just isn't there. At $200 it's priced like a brand name mesh jacket but it doesn't feel nearly as thick or protective as a Joe Rocket or similar item. Second, the arm length is short. Admittedly, I have full-length monkey arms which make sizing tough on any clothing *sigh* but these ones are even shorter than usual.<br /><br />Since I'm no expert on wear resistance I can't say it won't hold up in a crash, but I wouldn't like to find out. It sure is pretty hanging in my closet, though!",0
5,Look perfect but I wish that they had come in a box,1
2,"Okay quality but they were too big for my face, so I returned.  I give Amazon five stars for the quickly processed free return.",0
2,They hurt my ears! I splurged on some RayBans and they don't bother me at all.,0
5,Lovely & sturdy. Awesome lobster clasp as well. Fast shipping.,1
1,bought two neither one will tell the correct time past one hour,0
5,These bags turned out to be better than I had expected. Theyre much prettier in person than on the website. The only down side is no interior pockets BUT I knew that when ordering so I'm still giving a 5 star review!,1
5,Bought it for my friend who is a hairdresser and she loved it.,1
1,This shirt is ver wide and too short in the front.  Not as shown!  It seems like as the size went up all the did was widen it.  Don't waste your money!,0
2,"Cute design, fabric way too thin to be used as a face covering. Maybe over another mask. I'll probably wear it as a headband",0
5,"These socks are awesome !! I never knew socks could make such a difference. And such of range of products from thin to thick. Get your correct size, fit is very close to actual.",1
2,Couldn't fit it,0
5,Gorgeous necklace. Glad I bought it.,1
2,"From a distance the mask looks good but there are a lot of drawbacks.  The mask is very uncomfortable and came deformed from the packaging and shipping.  I've been trying to reform it so it sits better on the head.  It will do the job and it seems a lot of companies sell the same mask with a wide price range.  The generic photos online make the mask look better than in reality.  Considering the time, energy, effort and money to recreate a solid Bane costume, I do wish this product was better or a better product was available.",0
5,Great bag! Easy to clean and very comfortable,1
2,You get what you pay for,0
1,"Not having very many interior pockets made it challenging to keep thing organized. I bought this for my European trip, and upon returning home I found it already ripping at the seams. That was only after 10 days of use!",0
1,[[VIDEOID:1bb906aa9af676c2f1c8e43852a83612]] This ring has no detail compared to the picture on the sellers page and it turned my finger black after wearing it only during the day for 3 days,0
5,I like it. It fits perfect.,1
1,Logo stitched on looks tacky and literally about to fall off right out if the bag. Terrible buy,0
5,I like the fact that it has 8 alarms. Since it’s a kids watch I can’t be too hard on how small the words are when trying to figure out how to set alarms and other things.,1
5,I love these for hiking. Doesn’t matter if they get sweaty or stepped on for the price. They stay on my face while wearing and on my head when I have them off. I also like how reflective they are.,1
2,Disliked and returned due to fabric. Too much static and wasn’t quality material.,0
3,"good quality, very heavy, did not realize there was a cross inlayed, should have looked at detail more carefully, my mistake.",0
5,"The quality is great, thick material that is not see through which is awesome for being a white swimsuit. I actually felt comfortable and did not have to fix the swimsuit suit getting out of the water or walking around. It covers everything and super cute and modest look. Awesome purchase.",1
3,"The boots are beautiful, but I ordered a size 7 and they were too big, my boss tried them on and they fit her perfect.  She wears a size 8.  Wanted to exchange for smaller size but they were not available.",0
3,Look cheap.  My waist/hips are smaller than the sizing thinks. Would not purchase again,0
1,They are beautiful earrings but the backings were too large and the earrings would just fall out of ear. I had Have a replacement order too because it didn’t deliver the first time. The second time it was sent I got a pair that just were not up to the standards of an earring. At that point I wasn’t waiting another three days for another pair to be replaced. Don’t order not worth it.,0
4,"I think the pilling is a result of the gloves being 100% cashmere.  A blend would have been a better choice of material.  But they are comfortable, soft and breathable while still being warm (probably appropriate for 35F and above weather - below that, you'll want something more heavy duty).  They also hold their shape really well.  I actually wear these at the office when my hands get chilly, and also outside commuting by bus so that I can use my smartphone without taking my gloves off.  I just wish they didn't pill so much.",1
2,"I love love love this, but unfortunate the sizing is all off. It would be better if they were more true to size  :( now I can't wear them. I washed them before tryihng them on so I don't think i'll be able to exchange these for a (much) bigger size. who knows, maybe it's the squats I've been doing.<br /><br />meow. &#62;^..^&#60;",0
5,The fabric is rather thin and therefore perfect for bed sleeping. I will order another one.,1
2,If I had known how tiny this would be I wouldn’t pay more than $3 for it. Fell for the old photo trick where they zoom in to make the product much larger than life. Geeze.,0
5,Satisfied,1
4,Love the variety. Don’t wear long or they will tear.,1
5,"MY  TOP PICK , GOOD PRICE AND COMFORTABLE.....THEY DO THE JOB",1
3,I went off the size chart and ordered a size 5.5 for my son who's foot is just under 5&#34; long.  They were way too big.  I would normally keep them but I'm afraid he won't need sandals (weather wise) by the time he grows into them.  Otherwise they are just as pictures and a cute sporty style. I was also not so sure about the velcro strap on both ends - you can't really tighten the top of the shoe to make it tighter.,0
5,I LOVE this necklace!!  It is the perfect size!  It's large enough to really get noticed but not so big that it looks gaudy.  I also love that it's so versatile.  I can wear it with jeans and a shirt or with a nice dress out to dinner.  I get tons of compliments on this necklace and wear it all the time!,1
5,"Great carry-on bag, well built for a week's<br />worth of clothes-using it currently on a<br />Connecticut/LA six day trip.",1
3,Like the style and fabric. I wear a size 6 but I ordered a size med which is an 8/10. the bottom fits fine but the top is a little snug for a med size.,0
1,"My son loves this leggings and this brand. However, I paid extra for the “fire ball” design on the knee of the legging. Instead I got a plain pair of leggings. The leggings are fine overall and I’d buy them again but my son is mad because he wanted the designed ones. However, he’d already opened and worn them before we realized what had happened.",0
3,"Cheaply made, even more than expected. Keeping it, but would not reorder.",0
5,Very sturdy and rigid. Needed more bags and these fold up better than the plastic type ones and seem to feel stronger when carrying groceries.,1
3,"Bought this 1 piece to wear on vacation, however it isn't for big booby females. Purchased a large 200lbs",0
1,Returned this item. Not appeared as it did in picture.,0
5,Luv all the colors ❤❤❤❤❤,1
1,"Let me start saying that I use this under my cloths, I work in a cold storage and the batch is under my jacket, as I said I bought it in August 1,2018 and I think the life expected to be more than a year, it just broke from the hook that holds the batch to the land yard, something that doesn’t move too much on my case.<br />I don’t know if the price worth to use it for just less than a year.<br />Update 3/2022, it seems that I don’t understand or just want to give it a second chance, I bought it again and there it is!, same problem same poor quality, it just look like if you want to use this set of batch holder you just going to need to change it every 7 to 10 month again and again and again, to me this is it, no more chances to try anymore.",0
5,"Looks just like the picture, I got it for my son and so far no complaints.<br /><br />We had no problems at all.",1
3,"I’m 5’10”, 185lbs, I wear a normal suit jacket 40 reg for a fitted look. This large is a little loose in the body(you may like that?) but the sleeves are about 2” to long.  I should have gone with the Med. The  material is not your normal suit jacket material but is very velvety and sporty. May return...",0
4,I’d say it’s true to size. The material is thin but it looks good on.,1
1,"I loved the color, it was just what my husband wanted. We where happy with the purchase, he had to wear it right away. Two hours into the night the glass face plate fell off and broke :(. Would have been a 5 star rating otherwise.",0
5,"My wife needed a good watch for work as a nurse. It is durable, easy to clean and easy to read. For the price, this is hard to beat for a good watch.",1
3,"Not a fan, this was super uncomfortable to wear. I'm a size 14 with DDD cup breasts and it was NOT flattering at all.",0
1,terrible. they are so small I don't think they'd even fit on a child's ears,0
5,It was a beautiful casual dress!,1
3,"These yoga pants are nice and soft. Except I ordered the 3 pack and only one of the pair fit as expected. The other two are more like a large than the xl I ordered. I love the colors, I just wish the other two pair fit like the black pair. The grey is too tight and the green do not stretch at all in the waist area.",0
4,Wished there was a front view it is blank on the front,1
1,"i got the package the customs marked cell phone case and case for recharger-  there was nothing in the package  nothing.  my post office said they broke customs law as a claim for wrong customs  on the mailer and no items in it--  dont buy from this seller--- cant be trusted .  i understand this has happened before ,  as i now saw the feed back from others.  NOT GOOD!",0
5,Exactly as pictured. Love the color and style.,1
1,"This item was very pretty and extremely soft, however poorly made as the right side  pocket was literally sewn in backwards!",0
1,Everything was wrong. The material wasn't great cheaply made simply terrible.,0
1,Sent it to 7 year old granddaughter in Alaska and my daughter laughed and said it fit her dolls and don't worry about a refund......,0
5,Love the feel of the gloves. Leather feels soft as butter and fits beautifully,1
3,"Fits pretty well, but was a little disappointed in the colors.  They look much brighter in the picture.",0
5,"This belt is very sturdy and well made, It is good quality and has the right amount of thickness. I would order again.",1
5,"Great fit, super comfortable!",1
4,"This is my second corset purchase from this company. I'm very happy with both purchases.This time I went for the lace. I wanted to have  a little more sex appeal. My hubby is a sucker for lace. What a great bonus.<br />The Women's Lace Trimmed Elastic Mesh Fabric Corset, fit as expected. This time around I went for a size larger than the previous one. This one fits like a glove. The lace design is very intricate and is only right on the front side of the corset. I was kind of hoping that the lace would have covered a little more area. It has a large wide panel in the front with three rows of hooks that you can make adjustments as needed, either from gaining or loosing weight, even water retention can make a difference. I'm thankful to be able to make these types of adjustments as my weight tends to fluctuate between 5 to 10 lbs here and there. With holiday time coming this is going to come in handy, I'll be able to wear what I want with out the worry and hassle of struggling with the buttons on my pants.<br />This product was either given to me for free or I purchased it at an extremely discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
3,It is what’s pictured. But it’s definitely NOT as big as I thought it would be. And you can’t really read the letters because they are not deeply engraved. Not worth 8$ I paid but I still like it,0
2,Cheap looking,0
4,This charm is beautiful.  Very shiny.  Looks like it costs more than it does. The reason I didn't give 5 star is the size.  It's tiny.  I almost returned it but then I thought it was so pretty.  It goes well with the cross I am wearing so I decided to keep it.,1
5,Bought this cute little skirt for my daughter! She loved it!,1
1,"Did not fit, unable to return.",0
5,"this is one of those items that you can either give in a white elephant exchange or actually give as a present to a silly friend who's either 1) always cold/complaining about it or 2) loves koozies!! It's so funny. I'm gave it to my boss as a gift, and she loved it!",1
3,Good dress,0
5,"These clips were just what I was looking for to hold my shawls and ponchos together, not to mention, accentuate my figure when clipping the back of a slightly oversized dress or top.",1
4,Runs a little  too small gave it to my sister,1
5,Great little pin. Attach to your pinning ceremony ribbon and later to your employee badge.,1
5,Fits nice,1
5,"Just opened it and LOVE it!  Got the heart design.  Shows with purple pouch but came with black.  Not too heavy, just the right length for me.  Oh the magick to come....  Blessed be!",1
5,"Absolutely love these socks. The fit just right, and don’t slide down inside my boot. I didn’t need to double sock the winter because these kept my feet warm all day while wearing my steel-toe boots",1
5,Would love options of gold or silver accents,1
5,Great fit and seems pretty durable goodbye,1
2,Product runs small,0
5,"Can’t wait to put our daughter in these adorable outfits. Very happy with this purchase, they arrived in timely manner, and everything came just as described. Nice bundle for the price, will definitely look more into Mac and Moon clothes for our baby in the future.",1
5,"A little big, but I wanted something with a collar that allows me to move.  I loved it so much I also bought the blue chambray.  These are great for casual Friday's with khakis and also look great with leggings on the weekend.  Can't beat the price, either!",1
1,I bought this for my husband for Father’s Day and it started to rip after only 2 uses:(,0
1,"I am 5'7&#34; and 170 lbs the XL in this dress was not even CLOSE to being able to zip up on me.  I have no idea what kind of non rib cage, flat chested woman this is suppose to fit, but It was completely unable to come close to zipping up.",0
5,Love this ring.  I get so many compimentstudents when I wear it,1
5,I love it!! Very cuty,1
2,Actually very nice-I expected it to be a larger tote.  Great color. Hold office files easily.,0
1,"Mine was torn :( It is also fairly short, I was expected it to be like on the photo, but it barely covers the butt and I am not that tall. Will be returning it.",0
5,looks amazing love the color and fits perfect. thought I would need an x large but large was perfect fit.  need more colors lmao,1
5,"These came on time and as advertised. They came in a box, each one has a plastic sleeve around it. I used them as party favors for my daughter's birthday party and the kids loved them. They were a little big on the smaller kids, but my daughter is 7 and they fit fine, looks like they would fit adults also. Fairly good quality for the price, I didn't have any problems with the lenses popping out although there was an extra lens in the box, I checked all the glasses and none were missing. Overall vary pleased with this purchase.",1
5,Excelente,1
1,Do not buy.  Complete garbage.  I didn't even want to give a one star but was forced too.,0
5,"The most unique plugs I have ever seen and really well made, they also seem like they’ll last a long time.",1
5,Get one today you won't regret it .,1
5,"I purchased these without reading the reviews first...  I see nothing wrong with mine. None were broken, all were in the middle, and they are very sturdy. Very pleased with them!",1
5,They’re adorable<br />Perfect for pride weekend!,1
4,"Bought this for a 14 year old that already has two mid/high-end G-Shock watches. This isn't what you usually think of when it comes to these watches, but with the clear band and colorful face, I guess that's kind of the point. More a fashion watch than a rugged outdoorsy watch like you would expect, it's still the usual high-quality you get from Casio, just in a more ""oh that watch is cool"" way instead of a ""oh that watch is badass"" way. Kid loves it so mission complete, 4 stars.",1
5,My wife loves the gift!,1
1,It broke far too soon! I take good care of things and was disappointed it didn't last more than a couple months of moderate use.,0
4,"Very pretty, but a cheap material.",1
5,Love it .,1
1,Not a skinny pant as advertised. So disappointed,0
5,Love it!!  Cute and comfy. True to size,1
5,Got it for a cosplay. It was perfect size and weight.,1
4,"I like the pin, but it is so small.",1
1,These were not the common size they stated they were.,0
2,"Least favorite mask of the various ones I has ordered from different sources. Thick, rubbery feeling, not sewn well, and small. It doesn't even look great. No nose wire.",0
5,I got compliments on this shirt the first time I wore it. I’m a large but I ordered an extra large and it fit great.  I really like feel of the shirt as well.,1
1,"Bought this band to go with my girlfriend's new 38mm 3rd Generation Aluminum watch and it was a complete disaster.  The band itself looks of reasonable quality, but they do not fit at all in the channel where you attach bands.<br /><br />Being new to the Watch, my girlfriend managed to get one all the way in through brute force, making it difficult to get out of the channel.  The other would only insert, at great force, 80% of the way in.  Removing them required some ingenuity and brute force and one of the bands was damaged in the process of removal.<br /><br />There are a lot of third-party bands on Amazon.  Buy something else.",0
5,very nice,1
5,He was very happy with this he keeps it on his keys and on him all the time,1
4,"Really nice gloves for the price and nice fit, but the touch screen feature essentially does not work.",1
4,good,1
5,"It actually looks just like the picture,  I was pleasantly surprised.  🙂",1
4,Nice thick quality masks.  They don’t seal completely around on the face but they are comfortably snug on all sides. One of the best quality material masks I’ve purchased. Hold up well after washing over and over.,1
3,This was supposed to be a charm for a bracelet. It ended up being much larger than I expected. I would probably use it as a keychain charm due to the size. The quality is good though!,0
5,Very,1
4,Decent dress. But a bit plain.,1
5,This is a very high quality band and I love it.,1
3,Beautiful earrings but they are hard to get on. Getting them positioned just right to go through all the holes ( ear and earring!) is a challenge.,0
5,Fits great and comfortable too magnet holds very well,1
2,"Excellent undies. Great package pouch room, great colors, great price. Very comfy and soft. Best value in undies I've seen ever.......And I have to update this. I rated these as 5 stars initially. Unfortunately, I have to take away 3 and leave 2 stars because the waistband on these wore out completely somewhere between 3 and 5 months. They fall off. I sewed up one pair, and they are still not staying on, so sorry, these undies waistbands wear out making them useless except for rags.",0
2,"These are NOT normal size. The balls are about 50% smaller than a standard ball, the bar is fine but the balls are definitely way smaller.",0
2,Cute but runs small,0
3,The top fit great bottoms to big other then that it's nice has good support if your blesses,0
2,They are not easy to get on. Husband did not like them.,0
2,"It smelled odd, and was bent in some places. Not my favorite.",0
4,Nice. I was expecting design will come on neck ..but it comes too below the neck.,1
5,Beautiful!!,1
3,"The shoes are a little disappointing. The concept is great and attractive, but the proportions and shape are a little odd. I'm not so sure about having that much of my dress socks exposed.<br /><br />Aside from that it's very soft and comfortable. What it lacks in aesthetic appeal in first-person, it makes up for in sheer comfort which makes it worth it for me.",0
1,"Very small says fits all ,picture is a short one not a gown , head doesn’t fit through very tight",0
5,Love it!!!,1
1,I'm a large but this fits way too tight. The material makes me itchy,0
5,I like this a lot ...  Good material and soft .. Thank you,1
5,Excelente calidad,1
2,"Boots shipped in timely matter. They are very cute boots and the fit is a little snug. However, button fell off as soon as I put it on. The second time I wore the shoes another button fell of. The quality leaves a bit to be desired especially at the price point and I was very disappointed.",0
5,Had a problem when I first ordered this....was never delivered. But thanks to Amazon. I reordered with confidence and the birthday boy got it just in time! He loved it and looked even better than the picture! Very satisfied after a not so lovely ordering experience. Item is exactly like picture. Well made. Perfect for any eevee lover out there!! Thank you again :),1
5,This is the second pair that I have ordered from this company and I have been thrilled with each! The cufflinks are lovely and very detailed both recipients of these gifts have been very happy!,1
3,"More than a couple of traditional ear piercings are silly. I mean, piercings are a thing of the 90s and not edgy or interesting today. They are desperate. But if you want to trick someone these work great.",0
1,"I was really exicted when i got this...however, after I'd rushed to a mirror to try it on, I found out why this is so cheap. The part that is supposed to fit over your ear is nearly flat, and it kept slipping off. Also, my ear is now burning and red...suppose that's to be expected, but I'm very dissapointed. Don't waste your money on this.",0
3,"Very cute, I ordered a large, when I usually wear a small in US clothing. The back is almost thong style so I won't be wearing it to the beach but it is very cute! I wear a 32 D and the top JUST fits...",0
1,Its definately not 100% cotton. It's like wearing a tarp. I've tried air drying but still needs majorly ironed. The stitching is coming unraveled all over and it had dirt stains on it when I opened. DO. NOT. BUY.,0
1,Dress delivered was a different dress than the images depicted. Very unhappy.,0
5,"Exactly like the picture, fit perfectly, and super cute!",1
3,Comfortable top,0
5,"Ordered two of these; the hot coral and the goldenrod - both in XL size.<br /><br />They washed well and the material is not scratchy. The fabric weight is not too light & not too heavy.

5,I wear mine everywhere,1
5,Very cute,1
1,It is to little can I return it,0
2,Cute print on the shirt but sizing is extremely off. I ordered an XL and it fits like a small.,0
5,Looks good. I ordered one size up due to larger breasts.,1
1,"Was not light, sheer or chiffon<br />Pretty thick actually, just wanted a pretty sheer ""cover up""",0
5,The picture and the descriptions made it look and sound like there are two of them.  But the seller took my complaints seriously and refunded more than half of the money back.,1
5,Nice,1
4,Just what I was looking for!!,1
2,The skirt is very nice but it was a struggle to get it up over my bum. I ordered the XL which is bigger than what I need or so I thought.,0
3,Didn’t love the fabric.,0
2,This did not fit well at all. I bought a large and it was more like a small/med. It also did not fall well by the waist. Material was nice and soft tho.,0
1,Size is 2 times sizes smaller than normal. Make sure you order 2 sizes bigger. It is cheap but that’s what you pay for.,0
2,Refer to above,0
4,It's a heavier material than I thought. Think crocheted blanket.,1
5,My 3 boys love them! Used them as stocking stuffers. Only a few did not work. The little elastic finger bands are perfect for little fingers.,1
5,excellent and an amazing price,1
1,I didn't try this item. I returned it without opening it.,0
3,You can't have a tummy really better be slim. Its pretty and well made,0
5,I was worried that this dress would be like the others to short for my teen daughter but surprisingly it was not. it fit her great. It was perfect for her.,1
5,"Soft, warm, finger tips work perfectly.<br />Great gift!",1
2,"The size is terrible- ordered a large, received a non labeled sized sweater with no stretch that fits my eight year old aside from the sleeves.",0
5,Good,1
2,"Although the practice of motions to go through could be calming, the piece doesn't do anything except give you something physical to hold.  I thought it might slow down the exhale so that you were forced to push it out a little more? Just a little tube that you blow through.",0
5,My 7 year old Daughter loved it! (and it made her best friend a little jealous! ;) ),1
5,"Great buy, but it runs larger. Still beautiful!",1
1,Wrong item,0
5,"I really find this a nice design w/ease of accessibility to everything-lots of room w/o being bulky. I bought the lime green, very pretty. Soft. Clasps are all working after months of use. Well made stitching.",1
5,Great quality and comfortable to wear!,1
3,"For the price, it's an OK dress.  It does have a lot of static which I've had to get static guard to help.  It's has a more casual feel than I was look for and is short for someone who's 5'10&#34;.  It's great for a date night but not something I would deem appropriate for a work cocktail function.",0
5,Love it and it is as described.  Fast shipping as well.,1
5,Beautiful. Love it!,1
4,"I'm 5'11"" ,155lbs and bought the XL. It fit well but was too short in the torso. It felt like I was being pulled down by the shoulders and collar. Other than that it was cute and got lots of compliments.",1
5,I love this purse !! Very nice quality and feels and looks like a nice leather ! I will use this everyday and I think it will be a very durable purse! It is also very fashionable for any person. Had a little trouble with the Amazon delivery but now we’ll worth it ... might even order another color!! Thanks !,1
2,"These MISSJOY High Waist Yoga Pants with Pockets Soft Stretchy Active Yoga Leggings Tummy Control missed the mark.  First, the good part.  Phone pockets!  I love a yoga/legging with a phone pocket for working out so that I can go for a run or walk without having to carry my phone in my hand.  This way it doesn't slip out of my sweaty hands.  That's why this got 2 stars.  However, for everything else, I can't see myself ever realistically using these for exercise.  First of all, as a 5'10"" tall woman, these hit me at my mid-calf, so they look more like capris than a 7/8 legging, which is what the picture looks like.  These are stiff and don't really have a great stretch.  However, they aren't really great at tummy control or support.  Additionally, these are not high waisted.  I understand that I have a long torso, but most of my quality HW leggings stretch and hold to my torso.  These did not.  They sit below my belly button and do nothing for tummy control.  If I were to pull these up, they'd just slide down and give hella camel toe.  These are also not squat proof, which is a fancy term for they will be see-thru if you wore things to a yoga class or out running.  Therefore, I would say there other HW yoga/running leggings out there worth your time.",0
1,"I liked the color,  but did not like the material.",0
4,"very pretty, smaller than I expected",1
5,"Super soft and not too tight! It’s not loose by any means but it’s not uncomfortably tight. I love this type of material, making it even better :)",1
5,"I am a size S but ordered an M because I am tall, and I am planning on wearing a shirt underneath. The M fits perfectly. It is a thinner fabric but not cheap looking and feels very soft. Happy with it.",1
2,Broke almost immediately,0
3,About a size too large,0
3,Very small,0
5,Loving my pink sunglasses!!!,1
3,"I bought this watch band based in the photos. The band is very stiff time will tell if it becomes more flexible. The picture is a bit missleading as though it's the right size and fits, albeit very tight fit, in the picture the band looks larger that it seems on my wrist. The clasp feels cheap as well. You get what you pay for, and honestly I like the band it's just a lot of little things.",0
1,Fell apart before I could even use it.,0
1,Not easy to buckle,0
5,Beautiful and delicate! Everything on description. I am very happy with my purchase!,1
2,"Very disappointed! These glasses are HUGE!  You have to have a large, LARGE head for these these glasses to fit.  I bought these hoping I could wear them for jogging. NO WAY! The measurements are INCORRECT, they say they are 5.5 inches across.  The pair I recieved are over 6 inches across.  If you have a very large head, these are for you. If you have a average or small head, DO NOT BUY THESE GLASSES!",0
5,I loved the suit itself. The only thing i didn't like is that it digs in behind your underarm area.,1
1,I bought one size bigger than I normally wear. Because I like my jackets. Extra big and this one was still two sizes too small.,0
5,"It was too loose and it was way too short. It felt like a long cropped if that makes sense.  There’s no compression on it whatsoever. It might still work tho so I’ll keep it 🤷🏻‍♀️<br />The color is nice. Not too light. It’s like a grey-ish blue.<br />I ordered an extra small in revival dusky pink and that one was perfect. The length was just right. The compression was perfect. It fit my body perfectly. The color was amazing. I’m not sure if the difference comes from the style? I’d stick to the revival line better.<br /><br />***update*** the seller contacted me and sent me another pair of leggings. Vital marl blue in XS. These leggings fit way better. Right out of the package you can see the difference. Great compression, great length, no baggy-ness. The seller was very helpful throughout this whole process! Highly recommend",1
3,"Cute, fits well except the sleeves are very short",0
4,Nice wallet. A bit tight for all the stuff I need to fit. Good material. Not bad.,1
5,This watch is beautiful and I hope band will hold up as pretty as it looks. Last 3 watches have been real bummers. Broke either first wearing. Amazon always does better then this with products they sell that’s why I buy only from them. Check out products before you sell and back them up.,1
5,Although larger than my last scrubs I purchased this one is very comfy,1
2,"My sister put it on for 10 minutes and it started to slip off somewhere in between... and she didn’t even sweat. There should be some consistency with the quality here. Some work just fine and some don’t even stay on, like mine.",0
4,these are good for the price,1
4,"Adorable and light weight. Very affordable option for a designer look. But they aren’t the comfiest. The sole is very poor quality, so I’ll be adding an insole. But hey, you get what you pay for!",1
5,"This acrylic wrap is super soft. Its light weight is perfect for cool spring and summer mornings or evenings. It folds up into a small square, which is handy to put in my bag and take to the library, where it's always cold. I've received compliments on it every time I've worn it.<br /><br />Probably the only con would be that the back is longer than the front. I'd rather the length be the same.<br /><br />Although the laundry instructions say to wash in cold water and line dry, I figure if I'm going to wear it often, I'm going to wash it often, so I'm not going to be fussy. I washed it in the machine on warm and tossed it in dryer for 10 minutes. It came out perfect.",1
1,"The pair they gave me looks nothing like the one I bought, but it's still adorable. I like the pair that I was suppose to ge better though.",0
1,This is not red!! I received it and it was a ugly rusty orange ugly,0
1,"I bought one for me, one for my best friend. Within a week all of the gold plating had worn away. Then it turned both our our necks green and caused us to break out in a huge rash on the neck. Do NOT buy!",0
1,Very poor craftsmanship. Completely fell apart after wearing it for 6 months. Save your money and buy a quality product.,0
1,The necklace broke a few days after wearing it.,0
5,"loved the brightness of the color, fit perfect to size and the style very flattering!",1
5,"Freaking love!!! Oh, so does my husband, which is who wears it. Go Browns!",1
5,Perfect and sturdy keychains! Super cute.,1
2,"I don't like to give bad reviews but from the first moment I start using these bags they began to tear from the handles, and the same thing happened with all of them. I am sorry but I don't recommend this product.",0
3,A gift.,0
3,Like the material not the best fit around the shoulders especially when being wide. A little big I would stick to your size and not size up like I did.,0
1,I had a bad experience with this product. The first one that came in was broken and a replacement was sent to me. The replacement one will not clip on my glasses despite the listing stating that it will attach to any frames. This was a complete waste of my money. I would not advise this purchase.,0
3,I like the design of it. Kind of wish it was a little bit longer and bigger. Will try to work into the fit. Great product as far as production and quality but poorly designed in the croch/ vagina area! It's ridiculous how tight this garment is the vagina! I would like to send it back!,0
5,beautiful,1
2,Wrong size but good quality and arrive within 2 days.,0
1,"This hate came to me in a ball, literally. Its bent out of shape and looks ridiculous.",0
2,"I’m a size 6.5 and this thing hurts the top of my feet. A lot of pain, even when I used the largest ones.",0
5,"I was so grateful that it came in small sizes.  I son ring finger is a 5 and it is difficult to find unique and inexpensive jewelry.  However, this delivered in spades. It looks very rich on his hand and the craftsmanship is exquisite.",1
4,Really nice fit and comfortable,1
5,Loved it.,1
5,Perfect halloween outfit. It’s got some stretch so it’s comfortable and easy to move around in. Love the colorful aspect of this design too!,1
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE these spin shoes!!!! My trainer has 2 pr I was borrowing until mine came in hers are $200 a pair and I got these and I think their even better than the expensive ones :) soooo happy with this I LOVE to spin even more now!!!,1
3,I WISH THE STRAP WAS A LITTLE MORE FEMININE.  WAY TOO BIG,0
5,People do not realize when they buy Vibershield that they need to wear it 24 hrs a day in order to get the pain benefits. Never take it off an it will work great for you.,1
1,This thing fell apart on the second use. Badly designed so the holes were misaligned to the valves. Just a waste of money honestly,0
5,I was skeptical after reading all the reviews since people were saying the clicker stops working. I’ve had it for almost two months and it still works perfectly. I love how petite it is; was well worth the money.,1
4,"This flannel shacket is a great adorable option. I found this was affordable to others on the website, it fits great and looks great with jeans!",1
5,excellent,1
5,Nice,1
5,These earrings are so cute and well made.  I was really surprised when I received them and they were made so well.  Would recommend them to anyone who loves earrings.,1
3,"The earring has no problem just its smaller than tha picture is showing, very small.",0
5,This is awesome! Item is just as described.,1
5,Love these. Makes everything easier on the eyes while driving. No glares or sun in my eyes. Very comfortable.,1
4,"They are very nice ,just right size would like to know if all metal is sterling as am having some itching when wearing. Otherwise love them",1
3,I'm very picky when it comes to costume jewelry. These earrings don't look as nice in person honestly. I only wear the gold set. The silver set has the paint peeling off of it.,0
5,I thought I would be using most the one that carries less cards but I am loving more the one that carries more (even though I do not have a lot of credit cards). Nice quality.,1
3,"Would like it to be a little thicker, for my climate.",0
2,the tag said 2x mens but it does not fit it fits my 13 year old daughter.,0
5,Really nice pocket squares.  They look like they cost 10 times what you pay for them.,1
4,They are cute but I was missing one of them,1
5,This bracelet is nice. I am wearing it for my daughter's wedding.,1
1,"The sunglasses arrived with the packaging damaged. When I tried on, I realized that you see with distortion and I felt sickness after wearing it for one hour. I returned it and bought another that take care of my eyes",0
5,Muy pratovo,1
5,"great fit, nice material, not thin at all",1
4,"This is a really nice shirt. It runs a bit small though. But I like it none the less. I wear an large-xtra large. This is an Xtra large and it's a little smaller than I would like. If you wear an Xtra large, get an xxlarge.",1
4,perfect for the price,1
1,Low crotch and cheap. Material is see through!,0
3,They are okay. Thinner  than I thought they would be.,0
3,Unraveled and snagged easily unlike other elastic bands I have had..,0
3,I bought this for my daughter who wears hats and caps all the time. I tried it on to see how it would fit her and found it was a bit small. That is saying a lot since I have a small head. The top doesn't sit with extra material like this type of cap should. It is cute though. maybe for a child?,0
5,"Beautiful! Fits comfortably, looks great.",1
1,These are the SMALLEST nose rings I’ve ever seen. Very false advertisement.,0
5,"Very pretty, soft and lightweight!  The subtle pattern adds texture and a fashionable twist on a black Ruana. I wish it came in more colors because I would likely buy them all!",1
5,"Wore this with leggings and boots to work, got a lot of feed back how nice the shirt fit and really liked the material and the way it fit. I would recommend to friends. Very comfortable to wear, you can dress this up or if you had a nice figure you could wear as a dress.",1
3,They fit well,0
5,love them,1
3,If you have arms like pencilsthen the shirt is great but the tightest part is the seam around your biceps,0
1,Bought these for my husband. These are too small and not soft at all! They are a very scratchy cotton. Why would anyone want scratchy pajama pants? Returning.,0
5,Love these shorts I am 5ft 2in and weigh 200 lbs I got a size 16 they're perfect. Very well made. I have 2 pair.,1
1,Qiality wasnt as I expected,0
5,"I am for 4’11”weigh 110 pounds, 34 D D, 26 inch waist 38 inch hips and bought a small, it is a little long but fine with a pair of heels.  Want to buy in the other color too. Very comfortable",1
3,the material attracts alot of lint.,0
3,"I ordered XL... the support seemed fine putting them on and pulling to the top... however, they were too long for me and the elastic tops immediately rolled and were VERY uncomfortable... prob unhealthy too.  I pulled the top down to about mid calf and got through the day.. BUT......",0
1,I bought this for work because I can't have a lip ring while on the clock. I am using it as a lip stud and the inside cap cut up my mouth. It maybe a good product for your nose but I don't recommend it for your lip...,0
5,"The navy color is beautiful. Fit true to size. Not too light and not too heavy, just right",1
1,If your looking for costume jewelry this will do if you want authentic natural gem stone ones these are not it false description they are not all natural gem stones and customer service stinks I don’t wreck amend this company,0
4,Very snug fit order a size up,1
5,Perfect for the price point,1
5,"It was as advertised....good looking, sturdy, and simple to put on.",1
5,They are the best I love anime myself and I saw this and freaked when I got them that where to nice well made and they came on time so worth it,1
5,"I LOVE this! It is comfortable and so cute! I usually wear an XXL, but I got one size up after reading reviews - I’m glad I did. The one size up fits perfect and the sleeves are the right length.",1
4,"I love them, and comfortable",1
4,"This is a darling dress. It's very comfortable and flattering.<br />It's a bit short fur me, considering I'm 5'2""<br />I can't imagine how much shorter it would be if I were taller.",1
5,Great product. The pattern is vibrant and the fit of the lanyard is comfortable. It’ll be perfect for holding my comic con badge.,1
5,"Thinner than how it looks online. I have one from the same company that is wider and was expecting that width. Otherwise, still looks nice and fits just right. 👌",1
5,"It's easy to put in, unique, and has not turned my ear green. And way more stylish and affordable than anything I've seen at local piercing shops",1
3,It says 10mm but its actually 8mm so it’s gonna be small.,0
5,Very durable and plenty of storage.,1
3,"The outfit fit my little one ok, but the quality wasn’t great.",0
3,The picture is much prettier.. looks like a dress with a feminine shape to it.. it's  q boxy Wal-Mart quality long flannel is about it..,0
1,fake,0
1,Made my piercing red and was painful to the touch. And my nose has been pierced for over 5 years now.,0
2,I ordered assortment #3 and it came with 2 of the same and no dragonfly inn one. Super disappointed.,0
5,Got for our 5 month anniversary.  Havent taken it off and it's been 2 months now. Still in solid condition,1
1,I returned this item because it did not look like the picture. There was no gold on it so the shapes didn’t look defined like they do in the photo. Definitely get what you pay for - very cheap looking.,0
1,Not leggings at all,0
2,It’s cute. Broke the first time my daughter wore it,0
5,I love these. Will be taking them to an engraver to get what I want on them. Perfect for what I wanted.,1
4,I love the way it fits !!!,1
4,"This pendant honestly looks great! Great detail, condition, etc. Be wary of the chain. The chain was too small/awkward for me and seems to not be very durable.",1
5,Beautiful. It's perfect material for the summer.,1
5,Bought this during a lightning deal for under $20. Very appealing watch visually that looks more expensive than it is. Solid weight. Don't love the comfort but it was a $20 watch so can't complain.,1
4,Shoulders are narrow,1
5,My wife seemed to like it very much!,1
5,Shirt is great.  Fits real good.  Not too tight and long enough.  I am 5'10&#34; and I always have a problem that the shirt is too short.,1
5,Exactly what I wanted and it is beautiful.  I am extremely pleased and fortunate to have found it when I did.,1
1,"There is no room in the cups for medium or larger breasts. The cups are very shallow. I think the design could be better in other ways as well. Even if the cups allowed for larger breasts, there needs to be a little more support on the SIDES. Once the bra is properly in place, your breasts will instantly fall to the sides, because the bra is soft sided. The result is bizarre looking. Breasts are support from the bottom, but since they fall to the sides, the bra itself somewhat “folds”. Anyways, there’s no room and since it’s so flexible it makes your boobs look weirdly squarish. Sent it back.",0
2,"I am 5'1"" and 126lbs, I ordered a small. It is so cute, great washed blue coloring and nice fabric. I put it on and it fit perfectly everywhere except the top. It's like it's an XL top on a small bottom. I am a 34B but I think you would need to be larger than a DD to fill this out. There was no way to even add a snap or safety pin to close it, there must've been a yard of extra billowing material. If you are extremely top heavy, this is your romper.",0
5,I gave them away as gifts.,1
5,Purchased for next season size.  They are great and arrived on time.,1
5,"As advertised.  It is very light in weight. I used it to replace the regular buckle strap on my Luminox 3050.  It is much more comfortable, lighter and fits better than original strap. Almost feels like it's not there.  It is very adjustable for a custom fit. I'm very happy.  There are mold marks on the links but they do not interfere with the bracelet. They are not visible when worn normally. It is a plastic after all. I used the original pins and did not use the replacement pins that were provided.",1
5,Great quality!  It’s just as picture describes. My daughter loved it!<br />Size down on this jersey….runs big!,1
2,"Nice shirt but very small for size, arrived with no reciept or paperwork to be able to send it back",0
5,Perfect.  Not to big and the glasses fit the case also looks good.,1
2,Hard to breathe through.,0
5,"I really like it, very light",1
4,High cotton content will fade quickly.,1
1,"This top did not look ANYTHING like the form-fitted top shown here. Mine was two sizes too big, looked cheap and looked square....I do not understand the 5 star reviews, sent it back !!!!",0
5,"Got this as a gift for a buddies new baby. She's not quite big enough for it yet, but it looks cute",1
5,Large and simple to wear,1
5,"Cute shorts.  Their lined. Have pockets.  Has elastic waist, so if you don't want the drawstrings you can cut them off.  True to size",1
4,"These are super cute, but they’re not as darkly tinted as I was expecting. Perfect for the evening though when it’s not super bright out but enough people sensitive to light need some shades. The listing also said they are 52 mm but they’re the same size as my 50mm sunglasses, which is actually a plus for me since I prefer 50mm. They are very lightweight but clear and the nose pieces are very comfortable. I’d still like a darker pair but I am satisfied with these.",1
1,No sirve para bebe por el tamaño es muy grande,0
1,We ordered a pack of the size eight. We got one size nine in the pack. After wearing for four weeks the ring turns smooth and loses the grain detail.,0
3,"Pros- cute sweatshirt, well made and really soft. Cons- runs small!! I’m 5’6” and 135lbs and normally wear a medium, however, I ordered a large because I like my sweatshirts to fit loose. It was still too small and pretty short in length. I ended up giving it to my 11 year old daughter who it fit perfect.",0
5,tubular broski,1
1,My 4yrs old girl don't like it won't stay up it roll down . She is wearing a dress i tought is perfect for her to wear she get cold her legs. She never wear anymore. Hope this reviews help,0
1,"Nothing like how it was described,<br />Came only 10 pcs mask instead of 60 pcs, 4 pcs of pockets also didn’t come. This was scam",0
3,"Just too tight at the waistband and hurt, even though it was the right size for my hips.  Nice material and would have kept these if it had been comfortable for my waist.",0
2,Not happy at all with the robe. It is poorly made. I think I’ve maybe worn it twice when my older robe needed washing. My older robe is the same brand so that is why I took a chance on this one. Also noticed a small tear in it.,0
3,The cover does its job just fine<br />Just adds a lot of bulk to the minimalist intention of having a single slim FOB,0
3,great gift and she liked them perfectly,0
5,I absolutely love these glasses. They fit great and look nice!,1
1,Very cute but did NOT fit my Pandora bracelet 😒,0
1,"I really dislike the legs of these. I thought they would help smooth upper thighs out due to the boyshort style, but the moment I sit down, they roll up and the only way to unroll them is to pull up my dress to do so. Not so great to have to run to the restroom to fix them constantly. Also, you can see the lace and how they cut into my legs through the fabric of the dress that I bought these to wear under. Just not happy.",0
5,Looks cute on,1
1,Returned mine. Too big,0
5,"These perform very well to hold masks in place and create a better seal. The tape comes on a single large role and is pre-cut into about 2 inch lengths. The tape itself is substantial feeling -- it is thick, is very tear resistant, and has a sort of spongy feel to it. It sticks very well -- I've not had one fall off even after hours of use. But, when you do want to take it off, it's not a struggle -- it peels off my face without any discomfort, and does not leave any glue residue behind.<br /><br />It is a bit pricey for a role, but since each piece can be re-used (if you take it off carefully and don't fold it so the sticky side contacts itself) it makes the cost more reasonable per use.  The manufacturer claims it can be re-used 3 times, but I've found 2 times is about all you can expect before it gets too grungy to make me want to use it again.<br /><br />Very handy to have in these days of mask wearing.",1
3,Okay this is a cool idem but they claim its dusty brown no its not its a darker green with tan face.,0
1,"They are tiny, very tiny.  In good lighting you can see the stone... get what you pay for!",0
5,Quality for the price,1
1,"Super cheap, ugly material. It looked like a plastic brick so we returned them.",0
5,my father loves them !!,1
3,"I really liked this dress. Nice fabric, lightweight & breathable. I bought one previously & returned it due to a middle seam being in the front instead of the back. Recieved the new dress & it was the same issue. The pattern hid this oversight very well so I decided to keep it & wear to my event as intended. No biggie. Bought a medium. 145lbs, 5'2"", DDD",0
5,"Beautiful leather purse.  Exactly as described.....only problem is IT IS HUGE!  I'm not blaming anyone but myself for not paying attention to the dimensions .  It is much too big to be carried daily unless you have to carry your laptop, IPad or other work related items.  Again",1
4,Decent for the price. They feel pretty sturdy and have a good weight to them. They are not as large as I thought they would be. I have a large head and face hahah and was looking for a larger and wider pair of sunglasses. These are about the size of standard Ray Ban Style glasses .,1
5,Soft with great support. Very happy with these!,1
3,"Earrings are light weight, the earrings are HUGE, from ear to shoulder.They have cute detail for the price and are comfortable enough considering how big they are . I ordered black and they have a really brown tone . I was expecting more of a black earring along with a regular size earring or I would have given another star ! Delivery was fast ! Over all of this is what your looking for it’s a good buy .",0
3,I like it,0
5,Very fancy bracelet,1
3,"This skirt is great. It’s a nice quality, and while it’s not altogether see-through, I recommend wearing a slip underneath. My biggest issue: sizing! I’m 6’1” and wear a size 2/4. Based on reviews, I sized up to a Large and really should have ordered an Extra Large. In this picture, the elastic is fully stretched, and it’s snug.<br /><br />***Tall ladies, be aware this skirt still doesn’t make it to ankle length. On me, it falls 3-4” above the ankle when the skirt is worn at waist level.<br /><br />For the price, you can’t go wrong.",0
5,Very nice,1
5,I ordered these for stocking stuffers for my kids (boy and girl) and was so excited to see a great assortment for both of them!! About to order more for our trip to Disney!!,1
1,length is shorter and beads smaller than they appear. Wood is also a dull clay like brown. Not glossy and showing the wood grain as pictured. Totally feminine sizing and clasp. Would be to small for most outside their teens.,0
3,sizes are bigger than they claim,0
5,Loved it,1
2,I’m a regular size 4/6 and I purchased an 8 to be on the safe side. They were still too small. I have to return them. I still do like the style.,0
4,Realmente la talla es justa mi hijo grueso pero quedó bien,1
5,These are great for some projects. The metal is thin and bends very easily,1
1,"I got the Khaki color. Material is super thin, OK.<br />If you sweat at all it turns very dark and almost transparent! Extremely unsightly!",0
3,Has a wonderful look to it... But cheaply made. Broke after one use. Still pretty to look at and got plenty of compliments although it does not look like it does in the pictures.... I have mixed feelings about this. It feels more like costume jewelry.,0
5,"My wife loves these, and very nice quality too!",1
5,"[[VIDEOID:1faf54a6e7d3fec48b24e9b89a25d86]] I purchased this jacket for my 17 year old nephew. He is 5’11” and weighs approximately 145 pounds and typically wears a size medium. The outside is shiny and black in color and the interior color is a vibrant orange. It is super lightweight and slightly puffy.  It is a thinner jacket but could easily be layered for colder weather.<br /><br />It has two zippered pockets on each side, a small zipper pocket on the arm (you could fit your ID or credit card) with a pen holder for 4 pens, and a pretty deep interior pocket on the left side. On the left arm above the pen holder/zipper is a Velcro patch that has an American flag on it. The patch is removable so if you have a different patch you could probably change it out. The American flag is slightly smaller than a credit card.<br /><br />This jacket looks great on, it’s got great colors, and is versatile to wear with many different looks. According to the tag, it is machine washable which is a plus. It is surprisingly warm for being a light to middle weight jacket.<br /><br />I am really happy with the fit, feel, and look of this jacket!!!",1
5,Me encantaron excelente y comodos y con estilo (I love this sunglasses),1
5,Fit is true to size,1
2,Huge.  I am 5'9&#34; and a G/H cup bra and I'm swimming In it. Size down.,0
1,In the review it say the midium fit  perfect ...im 32×32 and i ask for a medium and do not fit  is too small for a medium ......i will never buy this again,0
5,love,1
1,"Too big and bulky. I wouldn’t mind it too much if they were a little flatter. Even when you do have the backing pushed all the way, they are still so big that they hang because of the weight of them.",0
5,love them,1
2,"I was very disappointed that this hat runs small. The stone us very cute and I loved the fabric, especially the color (light blue). I have a very average sized head and have never had problems wearing hats, but this one was immediately uncomfortable. I took it off right away. It does have ribbons to adjust the fit, but only to make it smaller; it was already at its largest.",0
5,"LOVED THIS COVERUp! The picture- Im in the<br />Blue!<br /><br />Flattering, dries quickly, covers for restaurants and walk up bars, could double as a little beach dress.<br /><br />I ordered one size up and I am glad I did. Not a ton of give and will beach and wet swimsuits i was happy to have a little room and still totally flattering.<br /><br />I ordered black, white and royal blue! The blue is my favorite!",1
5,Great hat,1
4,"Bought for my 23 month old, small-headed child to go to a car race. They fit great. They expand really well to fit different size heads too.",1
4,"[[VIDEOID:7cd8ceb6213878a083b4af2dfd615659]] I'm an avid pin collector so I usually try to get my hands on whatever I can find. There aren't a lot of options to buy pins in bulk so I thought I'd give these a shot. I was worried because the reviews kept mentioning getting all medical ones. I didn't as you can see but there are a few that are less desirable. They are all very high quality regarding picture and thickness so that's why I'm pretty satisfied. I wish they'd cool it with the motivational And book related pins, but I did get some cool ones like the snake skull and the creeper. Just don't expect to get what you see in the pictures they show you. This is a gamble.",1
3,"I normally wear a US XL in a top, but after reading the reviews, ordered up 2 sizes. I’m glad I did; the top fit well. The bottoms were very loose fitting and more like underwear than shorts. (The legs of the shorts were basically nonexistent; no more than an inch long.) It was more important to me how the top fit than the bottoms.",0
5,"I'm a 36 C but always get a medium for unpadded things because I like the support. I read the reviews for this and ordered a medium and an XL (not large available) and saw that I could just return the one that didn't fit. Medium fits perfectly, very happy with my order, I got my refund and returned the XL. Thank you 🥰<br /><br />Edit: for my boobs, I do pop out a lot but that's fine for my purposes 🤷. I would like to buy another, how can I get notified when it's back in stock?",1
4,"This is a nice  light weight flannel robe, long length.  I'm 5'7"" tall and  the hem reaches to a few inches above my ankle.  Good quality fabric; it washed well and and didn't pill.  Very well made and the piping is a nice touch.  I would order it again.  I gave it 4 stars, though, because it has only one pocket and that feels weird to me.",1
1,Beautiful,0
5,"For the price, they really were a beautiful highlight to my flapper costume this year!",1
4,"This runs a little small, so order one a size larger.  Also, it has shoulder pads.. but they are totally removable.  I haven't removed my yet, so I am not sure if the shoulders are going to set right when I do.  However, the fabric is nice, and the design is clean and unique.  I like this, but probably wont wear it until I loose about 10lbs, which is a little disappointing.",1
5,My friends daughter is obessed with shoes... maybe I am the influence in her life.  She thinks these are great ... They ran a bitlarge but she will have more time to enjoy them.,1
5,Nice light-weight and stretchy,1
1,This specific manufacturer has a fake ventilation val.  You cannot breath!,0
3,"These don't have elastic, and for a little boy, that can be a problem sometimes. Cute, but not as practical as we thought.",0
5,Great costume for a play,1
5,"Algo olgado para mi gusto, pero aceptable. Buena calidad, textura suave y ligera.",1
1,Did not like it,0
4,These earrings are not too big or little I live them will bit another pair,1
1,They just don't work well.,0
2,"After only 3, maybe 4, times wearing it, holes started forming EVERYWHERE and it is now too ruined to wear anymore.",0
1,Awful quality. The gem fell out within one week of buying it. It wasn't the right size either. It definitely was not sterling silver as advertised.,0
3,"It’s not dark washed like the picture at all, which I will have to do on my own. Still looks good but lacks any depth/contrast as it.",0
1,The jewels fell off after wearing for 5 minutes. Extremely disappointed.,0
4,"These do keep your glasses from denting your nose, however, they are large and very visible. I wear them when I’m home and if I wear my glasses outside, I remove them. Easy off and on",1
5,"I LOVE THIS HAT! I get more compliments on this hat than I know what to do with LOL. I wore tha hat for my nephews wedding because the theme color was purple. I had bought this about a month before and the wonderful occasion came up, PERFECT! I want it in the brown color too. My husband calls it my “ Mad Hatter”hat. Don’t care I love this hat.",1
1,Order 1-2 sizes up,0
5,Ordered on line because my son also did and I liked the product for the cost. I was not disappointed and both of the hats were great.,1
5,Product is exactly as advertised and arrived in a timely manner.  These gloves work fit very well on my medium sized hands.  They offer good tactility with added protection of a rough surface area on the finger pads.  This helps extend the useable life by preventing holes from forming so quickly - a problem I experience with Mechanics gloves.,1
2,Couldn't use it to small to tight not true to size,0
5,Very please. The dress is beautiful.,1
5,"Our family are sockaholics. Everyone has their own tastes in lengths and fabrics.  These seemed to win everyone over. Husband, son and wifey too.  The guys ware 12-13 in shoes, I'm a 10 and we all fit them fine.  I LOVE the material. It doesn't catch or pick up junk on the floor.  I liked them so much I told my son he could only have the pink and he liked them so much he happily grabbed them up. I gave in and traded him for a blue set .. and snuck the pink into my husbands drawer  .. hehe",1
4,They do the job and do not irritate the neck.,1
1,too small,0
5,Good quality great fit,1
5,So glad I ordered this. Needed something like but with decent coverage for this hot summer. I am 5ft7in and weight 185-195 lbs (been losing weight) and it fits nicely. I haven’t washed it yet but will be delicate in doing so.,1
5,Everything..The fit is perfect.,1
4,these are very tiny but good for a third earring hole and made well good for the price.,1
3,This costume is just ok. I ended up returning it because I wanted something with a tighter fit and  it looked baggy once I tried it on. I’m 5’2 about 135 lbs and got a small. The dress bunched up and rode up as I moved around and I would have to constantly pull it down to get it to look right. Maybe on someone taller it would be a better fit. The fur trim was cute but the ears on the hood looked flat and lifeless. The adjustable zipper in front was cute and made the costume look sexy. If only it fit me better everywhere else.,0
1,First wash Hand wash cycle cold on machine lined dried all 4 I bought are a mess those little fuzzy balls everywhere,0
1,I bought the light pink and it looks like pajamas. The material is really thin and doesn’t look like “clothes” at all. Very disappointed.,0
3,These shoes were too tight and were uncomfortable.,0
5,"I loved these and enhanced my nose and ears !<br />Very hard to put it very very very hard to screw the ends! But ,once done, I am happy with it!",1
1,Hole in it first day,0
5,I love the material that they used. I like the softness.,1
5,great product. will buy again. the quality is so far so good,1
5,I absolutely love this dress! The quality of the material is great and the cut is very flattering.  The skirt is a liitle thick so you don't have to wear a slip and is perfect for cold weather! I'm 5'5 and 42D I ordered the 2xl and it fits perfectly.,1
2,Hurt my feet,0
3,When I opened it I honestly thought I had ordered reeper hands. It was just unexpectedly large for her machine hands. It’s also very tight on certain fingers.,0
4,Fit fine for me but it can get small. Great material and very modest. It is so beautiful,1
4,"I like the tiny size of these earrings and that they are real gold.<br />The simulated aquamarine stones are just fine for me - don't need the real thing as these look good.<br />and the price was so good, compared to other similar products or even less quality ones.",1
1,This product was cheap and I wasted my money.  It was a gift and I will not give to my great nephew for Easter.  Name is an iron on patch and you can see it.  It is terrible and I should have never purchased it.  Total disappointment.,0
5,Fit nicely over my glasses and cut down the glare from oncoming traffic,1
3,La calidad no es buena,0
5,Loved it.,1
5,"They are adorable, and a good size and weight for an adult. Nice quality, well packaged and good communication! Thanks!",1
1,Too big. Disappointed,0
2,"Cute and a great fit (Small, I'm 5'4&#34;, 125 lb and pear shaped) but the light color was see through.",0
1,Did mine the name of the leggings,0
5,Awesome,1
4,"I love the pattern and design of this dress! It is a little small in the chest area though. I usually wear a size Large, but had to get an XL for this dress and it still felt just slightly constricting.",1
2,"UPDATE: Original review below still applies. After a lot of messy work with spray foam, paint, orange Christmas lights, a mini fog machine (dont use extra foggy fog liquid! It’s too much for witch’s brew but perfect for a stadium concert;) cardboard, drill, etc, etc, my cauldron turned out pretty good (pictures don’t do it justice, unfortunately) This ended up being incredibly expensive in the end & I don’t know if I would do it again but I could not find a witch’s cauldron like the one I had in my head anywhere! So after looking on and off for a couple years and searching you tube this year I decided to make it. It’s close enough to what I envisioned. Next year I’m making a younger, prettier, but still scary life size witch. As you may guess I’m a bit obsessed with Halloween Witches😉<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I like the size, it’s huge! But for $60 + $30 shipping, not including tax I expected much much better quality. The rim at the top is all jagged and has some very thin areas which screws up my original plan of hanging in from a tripod I was going to make to make it appear it was hanging above a fire. Don’t waste your money! Most people won’t want one this big anyways.",0
2,This was super cute but didn’t have the wig or magnifying glass had to go buy another wig,0
2,The stripes were not aligned in the back.,0
3,Love them very comfortable,0
5,For swollen and big feet they work amazing,1
3,"Super cute and comfortable earrings,  a tad smaller than I was expecting.  HOWEVER,  the crystals have already started to fall out.",0
1,The quality was terrible and it was nothing like the picture.,0
5,"I was surprised by the quality of these skirts. I am a bit on the short side (5&#34;1) but these skirts where the perfect length (Once worn high waist, which is what I wanted). The fabric wasn't too heavy but not so thin as to be see through. I do also love the vibrancy of the red skirt, an the colour has yet to fade after several washes. I would definitely buy again.",1
2,Runs Small!,0
5,They are gorgeous very well made same prints from picture love it.,1
5,This is now my favorite accessory.,1
5,Not the most flattering but very toasty!,1
4,Good for the price!,1

5,Very nice and sexy I just wish you had xs because a small was slightly big I'm a size 4/6,1
4,"I never had a metal allergy in my life until I bought a few of the silicone sport bands with the large round stainless stud. With every one of them my arm would have a 1-2” diam red irritation within a few days. I tried clear nail polish over the stud, I tried moleskin over it, stick-on foam patches. This all bought me a few days, but then the irritation would come through. But I really really like the sport bands So I just kept putting fresh moleskin on about once a week.<br />When I saw this one with its teeny little hex stud, I decided to take the plunge, and so far so good. I’ve been wearing it continuously for several weeks now. I put a couple of layers of clear nail polish over it first, and I will replenish that periodically but so far it’s working and my arm isn’t red at all. It’s working so well that I ordered a couple of others in different colors.<br />I agree that it’s a little more difficult to put on than other sport bands, but I don’t care. It works. I only take it off and put it on once a day. I can live with that. And the other thing about it that’s annoying is that it is LONG! The extra wraps underneath and all the way under the watch. I solved that by trimming about an inch off the end and that works just fine. But that’s the only reason I downgraded a star. I have a 6” wrist and if you were a 7”, it would fit fine! But I love it, I love the black and the dark blue with the rainbow colored inserts. Super cute! My favorite bands.",1
2,Beeds tend to move around and don’t look their best. The material is very stiff and hard to adjust.,0
1,Not cute in person. Even tried takling it apart to make it cuter.. Didn't work,0
1,"The dress looked nice but it was to big. I am a size 4. I ordered up one size 6 due to all the reviews stating that the dress ran small. I will most likely order it again in my actual size 4. I’m a 34C, small waist with hips and butt. It was both big and gaping in chest and waist area. It looked frumpy. I’ll post pictures when I re order. I ordered the silver but am thinking maybe trying the red one",0
1,This was a cheap mess. No one should buy this product.  This product is poorl,0
2,"I wear a 13 shoe, ordered the 13-14 size and they are at least a size small.  When I put my foot in, it is a struggle to pull the back over my heal, and fits far to snug for a slipper.  If you wear a 14, definitely order the 15-16 size.",0
1,"I've had this wallet for less than a year with hardly any use besides just having my cards neatly guarded and the typical run to the gas station and grocery shopping. I usually carry it on my backpack. The wallet is beatiful and has lots of room. It can get big is you use all available space. However, the inside liner where it meets with the leather is already ripping apart. It is not recommended due to lack of quality and craftsmanship.",0
1,"I purchased these sets as a Birthday gift, they were made so flimsy I told the receiver they were pajamas. The stitching was horrible and uneven.",0
3,Cheap and flimsy,0
5,"I love the earrings they are heavy for the ears though, they kept falling out of my ears but I got lots of compliments when I had them on.",1
3,These were just okay.  Not exactly what I wanted.,0
5,Really nice shorts that have zippers for running.,1
5,Bought for trip fits perfect,1
5,Ordered two other pairs loved by all!,1
2,Came with a hole in the seem over a inch long and smelled of smoke.,0
4,I love the three quarter sleeves!  The tunic covers my rear end and I'm comfortable wearing this with leggins even to church!,1
5,"I ordered these for my husband and they fit him great. They are lightweight so they feel good on his face. They are polarized so the world looks sharper. Plus, they came with a protective case and a cleaning cloth. Highly recommend.",1
5,Like the ankle socks,1
5,"These are part of a Santa costume.  &#34;Santa&#34; is a big man, so we expected the glasses would be small, but we are happy with the quality and they do fit as expected, small for a big man.",1
2,They are super heavy and they are way to big for the average wrist size,0
1,Can't hardly keep it on my ear... Very disapointed,0
5,"Got for my 16-year-old sister-in-law. She loved it! She’s a bit of an alternative girl—into aliens, choker necklaces, anime, all things *different* & even though she’s a dog lover who can resist such a cute, fuzzy little gimmick? I love the idea. I love how soft it was. So plush. Not sure what she’d put in there but if it were me, it would fit a small wallet and change purse, a some hair ties, emergency medication (Tylenol etc.) and some feminine products. Perfect for a night on the town! 😊",1
5,In the packaging the earrings look very small but once they are on your head they fit perfectly if you’re looking for just a little bit of sparkle without going crazy these are perfect,1
5,This was exactly as advertised and looks great. I purchased as a gift and the recipient was thrilled.,1
3,"The backs were too small for the posts,I broke two earnings  trying to force it to fit",0
5,"These are adorable.  A little larger than I expected, but very cute.",1
2,"I ordered 2 to use as friendship/diffuser bracelets. One came just as pictured. On the second one, the fixed bead furthest from the center was too far away, making it asymmetrical. I have requested a replacement.",0
3,The sweater is beautiful but the fabric is not soft it is really itchy.,0
2,Much larger than the picture makes it appear. My daughter did not like it.,0
5,"Great looking, comfortable and makes putting my Samsung watch on my wrist very easy.",1
5,"Sooo I got this obviously bc I’m in love w SPN and I wish I watched it sooner! Can you believe I finished 13 seasons in almost a month? And season 14 in 2 days?! It came perfect! The only thing that I changed myself was the necklace part, it was plastic-y and I changed it to a more flexible rope.",1
5,I love my ring,1
3,Pants were great but if you hold up you can see threw them...Material is thin.,0
5,This was a gift for my husband for Christmas and he loved it!,1

1,"Shirts are 100  percent polyester. On a hot, sunny day you sweat. You sweat and stink and sweat and stink. Not for me.",0

5,"Came nicely packaged. I thought the sayings would be a little more meaningful lol but they’re some good ones, nice charms",1
3,I know you get what you pay for but this watch won't handle any kind of physical work it feels like it would break so you have to be mindful,0
2,Letter is Very very tiny.  Cheap looking.,0
3,Fit is way to small. Fits more like a shirt. Didn't not even try the tights I thought they were leggings.,0
4,It's for a friend for Christmas so I hope she likes it!,1
4,"Love these dresses, though I didn't keep this one.  The pattern didn't do me justice but I kept 2 others in the same style.",1
5,"excellent, soft and comfortable to carry, lot of space☺",1
5,"Love the comfort, polarization, cost.",1
5,"I got these for my wedding in Mexico and they were a major hit! I ordered, in all about 100 pieces including light up head crowns. Battery life was good since I heard many people brought them back to the states. It was a perfect addition for “crazy hour” (the last few hours of our reception).",1

4,"This shirt is soft and comfortable but has  light colored slubs randomly across the shirt that look kind of like you have a piece of cotton stuck to the shirt. I like the shirt so I won't be returning it. Just be aware that it is slub knit and has random bigger threads across the shirt that are part of the 'slub knit' of the construction. It is a bit long as I am 5""3"" and so it comes down about 3 inches past my hips. It would be better if it was about 2 inches shorter for my frame. I like it but is very casual.",1
3,The quality isn't all that good but ok for the price.,0
1,I bought this in the size large. Would recommend you buy a smaller size.,0

1,"This ring is horrific.  I've seen better quality come out of a bubble gum machine.  The color of the silver itself looks fake despite the 925 stamp.  The ring came bent in several spots, and I was able to easily bend it with just my fingers.  I will be sending this back.",0
3,"I ordered a small, but the shirt ended almost at my knees",0
5,"Comfortable, true no show.",1

5,I’m always losing my nose ring. This product comes in handy especially when I’m on the go. I put a few in a jewelry bag to keep extra in my purse. I loved the price for the product. They last so long and the quality is superb. I use them all of the time.,1
5,Great size bracelet; the bracelet has presence.,1
5,Very cute ! I get a lot of compliments on these earings,1

4,"Definitely smaller than the normal sizes, but the Seller did mention that.  I gave it as a gift, and she loves it.",1
5,"I really enjoy the purse.  I use it every day.  It's a darker color, good for fall and good to hide any dirt/marks.  Multiple pockets and the middle zipped part are my favorite.",1
5,"I first got this set in 2018 and I’m still using them! They’ve held up till now so I say buy them!!! If you aren’t rough with your stuff, this is a good way to organize your clothes and such.",1

3,"I bought the shirt for my husband.  After the first wash, the shirt shrunk significantly and is too small for him to wear.  It is now a night shirt for me.",0
1,"The gauge for this is smaller than any other earring I've had. They fall out a lot, I even lost one of them after the first day. Wasted money.",0
5,Easy to use. just the right size.,1
4,"I think that I foolishly expected them to have more structural integrity, but they are effective. I simply thought they would keep their dimensions more stiffly.",1
2,Not for me. A bit short for wearing or sleeping also the material is a bit warm to get comfy.,0
5,Worked great for my 2 year old. I also tried it on a 7 year old bc I didn’t believe it would work and it did. :),1

5,loved this little shirt!!  So cute!!,1
2,Ok for Halloween or young girl...,0
2,"First of all, these are not anywhere close to being knee high, they are crew length. Secondly, the print is very blurry and looks nothing like the photo. Not even worth the $7 spent on them.",0

5,Have this in my daith piercing and it’s perfect,1
5,Product is stiff but hopefully it will soften. Great for glasses on one side and cell phone and moneybags the other in one small case!,1
4,Just a tad snug,1
5,[[VIDEOID:b69b9c60a459681f66f48183981e1bfc]] You can see from my video that the gloves are still and durable on the palms and flexible for the knuckles.  They are made of pigskin and the stitching looks even.  I mostly need them for mowing.,1
2,Cheap quality & definitely not worth the price !!!<br />Don’t buy it !!,0
5,True to size,1
3,This is a nice jacket but it runs VERY small. I ordered a medium. I get medium in everything. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 128 lbs. I can't even zip it so it has to go back.,0
3,"The color and look was nice and pretty, but the button would open to much as I had it around my shoulders afraid things would fall out, it keep opening",0
4,"I knew it would be too long since I’m real short. The waist, hip & thighs fit great). I have a weird body shape so I expected a little extra room up top but the top was HUGE. The V was SO LOW the sleeves were really big / long for short sleeves. I ended up hemming the sleeves as well & pinned the front.<br /><br />Also the string does NOTHING so I cut it off.<br />But it’s comfy AF so after my adjustments I really like it",1

1,"Bought a bigger size, and they fit it weird. Fits like a tshirt, not a dress. Wayyyy to short, and pockets are in really awkward spot below my breasts. I'm not tall! The &#34;dress&#34; is ridiculous. Would not recommend.",0
2,I ordered the cream dress and the color was very different in person than pictured. I was disappointed. The buttons were also different than I expected.,0
5,"This is one of the best bracelets i've ever had. It is very well made, the materials seem to be of very high quality. The whole thing looks very solid and definitely not cheap. I especially liked the lock, as you can see on the picture it is simple loop and hook design, but it is very reliable, never came off and easy to put on and off.<br />Highly recommended.",1
1,These are not sheepskin lined and don't appear to be leather. They are extremely thin with a very thin cloth lining. Don't waste your money.,0
2,They are way shorter than expected,0
3,The set is nice but sizing is off. It's supposed to fit 4 thru 10 year olds.  My granddaughter is 8 and it's way too big.  More like adult size.,0
5,"I like these golf balls, I have played them for a long time.",1
5,Great item! Adjustable straps allows it to fit all sizes!,1
4,it is little fit on me.. I like it.,1
1,"I ordered this cardigan sweater at the same time in the same size in both the grey and toffee colors. When they arrived, (they arrived together) the toffee one fit perfectly. The grey however is at least 2 sizes too big, although it claims it's the same size as the toffee. I am very disappointed because I waited so long to receive them (it took over a month coming from China). I initially was only going to order the grey, so I was very upset to find that the one I really wanted did not fit. They are also very itchy, and the fabric is not very comfortable on the skin for a long period of time. My skin turns red after even just a few minutes. I have to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath. It's also not very warm, despite how thick it looks. The grey is also waaaaay lighter than in the picture (try light grey) and is not solid colored. There are flecks of all colors interspersed throughout.",0
5,"Very nice color of the leather and stitching.  Match my Glycine flieger with black PVD casing perfectly.  Only wish the buckle was nicer, but for $19, this is a great value. Let’s see how long it lasts. The leather seems to be soft and genuine.",1
5,They look great.,1
5,"Waterproof, pockets and very roomy.",1
1,Absolutely worst ever😡😡😡😡,0
2,This bag was really scuffed when I bought it for my wife and it was missing the strap shown in the picture .,0
2,The lights have never been in sync and now only half of them work after a month of my daughter wearing them,0
4,The foot bed does not provide as much support as I expected.,1
1,I never got the item it's a rip off not happy at all wish I could get my money back,0
1,"Initial thoughts were that the set was cute, even if the long pants and sleeves of the long sleeve top seemed a little short. I am only 5'2"", so it surprised me. However, after wearing them multiple times over the course of a few weeks, I noticed that every time I wore ANY piece from this set, I would sweat so much I'd need to change clothes and sheets in the middle of the night. Never happens if I'm not wearing them, happens every time I do wear them. My guess is the faux-satin material traps body heat.",0
5,"This crop top is amazing! It fits great and the cleavage is sexy and at the same time safe for not showing any extra. The fabric is great and very comfy. I loved it, it looked great on me. I really recommend it, very versatile and sexy!",1
5,"Have to wear medical grade PPE, wearing this on top very comfortable .",1
5,I have a hard time finding a good belt without having to pay fifty dollars ir more!  I LOVE this belt.  Its even better than i thought it would be!  It's great quality and its beautiful!  Thank u!!!,1
3,"So you HAVE to use the markers that come with these AND don't get the marker that is provided on a traditional white board surface it's not easily removed.  I wanted to use them for my white board a stickers, they're not a good solution for that.",0
2,A $2.00 hat with a $1.00 decal. Would not buy again,0
1,"I didn't realize the materiel was ""clingy"".  It hugged the middle and that made it very uncomfortable to me.  The picture looked like it was a different materiel. I had to return it.",0
5,"Can I just say thank you to whomever designed this awesome bra! I am 11 days post op and my other bras (including the one the surgeon sent me home in) were uncomfortably digging into my anchor incisions! This bra is a Godsend. So comfortable I do not need any pads at the incision line. Also I'm hoping that when I can wear tops that show my shoulders this bra will work,  although the straps at the top may be a little wide. I ordered the extra large even though I'm about a 36 to a 38. Don't know what my cup size will be but this fit a little big, but snug enough to keep everything together if that makes sense.  Also the zipper ends are both covered by nice soft material.  After surgery you don't want anything tight. Buy it, you'll be glad you did!",1
1,Teeny tiny waist and super large oversized pants.not flattering. Maybe if you’re really tall and skinny perhaps??,0
4,I really like this pajama set. It's soft and comfortable and it has pockets! I do recommend sizing up as I ordered in my normal size and it's a bit tight.,1
4,Received an item that I'm looking forward to wearing around campus - Alex,1
3,The charm itself was as expected. The only issue I had was that the charm did not come with the Pandora bag as stated or shown in the images. I would buy again though. Still cheaper and good quality.,0
5,Amen,1
3,Wasn’t a fan of the skirt details up close but the skirt is true to size.,0
3,Not sure this will work and properly wrap around for anyone over 5'7/size 6.  Shortish length of sleeves seems to be the issue. Also appears to be quite basically put together. Arrived with one seam already fraying.  Keeping it anyway. Hope it holds up.,0
5,Love it. It’s more of a crop top on me but I like the length. And off the shoulder is a cute way of wearing it,1
1,"If I could give these less than one star , I would . You could get better quality stuff out of a quarter vending machine .",0
4,"I like this.  It's great for lounging in.  I'm not sure if I should wear it out in public or use it as a lounger at home.  It feels like a nightgown.  It doesn't fall off the shoulder for me, but I still like how it looks.",1
3,"not in love with it, but don't hate it either.",0
3,The material is thin and it took me 40 mins to do the laces. It would've been five stars but when I put it on it's great the only problem is the elastic at the top is super tight like it's  a small .,0
5,Fabric is beautiful . Fit perfectly. The color matched the pictures perfectly. Love the little bit longer fit,1
5,Fits true to size,1
5,This looks apsulty beautiful. You would never think that this was very very cheap. Fits good and came in a little velvet bag.,1
5,I really like this sweatshirt! The peach color is really pretty and the design gives me a nice shape. I am impressed with the material too. The fabric was soft and super comfy.  Plus it seems well made. I also didn't find any loose threads or stitching that was out of place.  I couldn't make out my bra lines; I always appreciate in a casual top. It's also long enough to cover my bum. I'd highly recommend this top. It's super cute!,1
1,This is not a dress only an owl t shirt. No skirt or belt comes with it. I am returning.,0
5,Amazing,1
5,Loved the product. Fit my large iPhone would recommend it to anyone needing a wristlets for a large cellphone,1
2,I was so excited that I finally found a 2X NC windbreaker and then as soon as it got here he tried it on and the sleeves were so short it didn’t fit me (his wife 5’6) and we are so terribly disappointed.,0
3,"This skirt is very cute, definitely stretchy jean material though, meaning it was a little larger than I had hoped. I have a shorter torso and a good sized butt so there's a little bit of a gap between my back and butt. It didn't hug like I was hoping it would. Still very cute and comfy, I wear it a lot!",0
1,The top just barely fit my dress which left me with no waist.  The skirt part was too huge.  Not worth sending back because it would cost me more in shipping.  So Goodwill makes out again.,0
3,"I purchased this pendant to wear for vacation and the beach-no tragedy if it was lost.  I also read the entire description and knew that it came without a chain.<br />It is an attractive pendant in a nice setting.  It has a lot of sparkle too.  However, IMO, it is too large in size to ever convince someone that it is the real deal.<br />The price, if you look at it as a whole, not as something with a ridiculously high shipping fee, was fair.<br />I gave the pendant a three star rating due to the size, and being that I felt the size given in the description was inaccurate.<br />I would also like to add, after reading another review, the pendant that I received was also not what was pictured.  I would have much rather preferred the pendant that was shown, rather than what I did actually receive.",0
3,It's tight but warm.,0
5,Loved it!!!,1
1,The hoodie is a complete defect from its  3x documented size way more than 60%,0
1,"This shirt is really terrible quality. I'm pretty certain it's not cotton as advertised and is very poorly made. The fabric feels like very thin polyester. It also feels like it's already falling apart. The cut is all over the place so nothing looks quite right and the stitching is in all the wrong places. I'm really disappointed because I really liked the designs. I've bought shirts from other Amazon retailers that I wish had this design. I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for a quality shirt with the same patterns but even though this is half the price of other shirts, it's not worth it for me because I'll never wear it.",0
3,They work as they should.  Over the course of the say however they do loosen up. Great for daily use if you are in and out of stores.  Blocks the wind very well,0
2,"I got this watch on the last day of november.<br /><br />The body itself seems sturdy, but the inside decorations look pretty cheap. The same goes for the band, it started cracking pretty soon. My wrist has a circumference of 7 inches, the band fit well, with room to spare.<br /><br />I noticed while trying to wind it that it didn't work like other watches where you leave the pin down to wind, and lift it to adjust the time. Instead, I lifted the pin to adjust the time and it also wound the mechanism. Turning the pin in the down position did make that faint clicking &#34;winding sound&#34; but ultimately did absolutely nothing. This seemed like a failure in the manufacturing process rather than intentional, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />The hands are pretty difficult to distinguish from the background. It's ok to tell the time in daylight, but in a darker environment (or if you have poor eyesight) it's pretty much useless. It doesn't glow in the dark.<br /><br />The body of the watch is a half inch thick, which is quite substantial, so be advised.<br /><br />It kept time perfectly during the day, but it wouldn't keep running through the night unless I gave it a few good shakes before I put it away (to activate the winding mechanism that responds to movement). I didn't mind having to set it to the right time whenever I wore it though, but if this is a problem for you, again, be advised.<br /><br />The band also started cracking pretty soon. I was actually considering getting a new band for it, but unfortunately the watch stopped working yesterday. I'm not sure what broke, but it won't even wind anymore. I didn't wear it every day, but I'd say I've worn it for about half of the time, so that would make it a month and a half (maybe two) of active usage.<br /><br />Because of this, I would definitely advise against buying this as a present for someone. Unless you want to disappoint them.<br /><br />In conclusion, you get what you pay for.",0
3,"The smaller set with two clasp was so weak in the magnets I won’t wear them. They barely come together and with a move of my neck they come loose.  The larger set with three, however, has great magnets and works out fine.",0
1,It was too small and it would be a pain to return it I'm afraid,0
2,Not really what I was looking for. I thought it was a &#34;wallet&#34; but is just two pieces of material with a band. My husband wasn't thrilled. Will be looking for something else!,0
1,Way more yellow than it appears in the picture which was a downer for me since I was looking for more of a soft gold color.,0
5,Shirt is great quality,1
1,DO NOT BUY THESE Shoes fit but they messing up my THUMB toes and nail bed  ON both feet not even doubling socks would work. I’m angry that it caused damage to where you would’ve thought I dropped a heavy box  on them nope not at all… 🤬😭😢😫majority of my nail bed is gone on both,0
1,I ordered a 2XL knowing how tall I am and when they arrived they went up half way to my knees I emailed the sender but they did not give me another pair and offered only half of what I paid other than that I loved the quality and material but come on dude,0
5,Great bracelet made of nicely polished stainless steel.<br />Especially like the clasp; beautiful and also easy to use.,1
5,My husband loves these socks there very comfortable easy to put on take off.  Makes his legs feel good.,1
1,The seam tore after one wash also fit was smaller than expected.,0
5,These came super quick and fit perfect! I will be ordering again.,1
1,Way to small,0
1,The sweater is not as shown in the picture. It's not even cable knit. More like tight knit polyester. Not cute at all!,0
5,"Love them, Comfy and great price!",1
3,"I requested either a S or M and got an XL, which actually isn’t that big of a deal because it still fits - just has a baggier look. The brown color is very nice and perfect for fall! The texture of the sweater is also nice both visually and feel wise. It says hand wash only but I missed that because there are no tags on the garment, and I ran it through the washer and dryer. It really stood up against that at least for this one first time, but I’ll try to wash in delicate cycle and hand dry from now on.",0
5,I love them,1
1,Cheap material,0
5,This mask is made of quality material that stands up to gentle washing by hand.  I mistakenly wasted some clear nail polish on mine which ruined it; but loved it so much that I ordered another.  The fit is perfect as it is snug yet does not prevent you from breathing easily.  Highly recommend.,1
4,"Fits perfectly, I love working out in them!!",1
2,Nice shirt but not made for large breasted women.,0
5,So cute in person. My daughter got so many compliments. She wore them multiple times in the snow too and her feet stayed dry.,1
1,"How could this possible be what I ordered?? Please see the photo of the “suggested” product versus what I’ve received.<br />Cheap, false!",0
5,"Good product, clean, looks nice",1
5,Love the style! Great design and save delivery!,1
4,"This dress is really cute. I'm 5'1, so it's a little long, and I will need to get it hemmed. It's a great value!",1
5,Not too thick not too thin literally the perfect dress for fall for play or school or a day out! Easy to wash. Runs a little bit big which is fine it’ll fit her longer definately satisfied!,1
5,"Very pretty, nice size, exactly as pictured & described.",1
5,Soft and comfortable,1
3,They are not wide enough,0
5,Very nice,1
1,Made for people with no boobs,0
1,"Awful. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Fabric looked nothing like the photo, awfully made. Would return it if I could.",0
3,Turn black to soon.,0
4,"Beautiful fabric and colors! The white is very slightly see-through It's very relaxed, kind of an A-line dress. I ordered the size S/4-6 and it's more on the 6 end. I thought it was too baggy for my 5'4&#34; 125lbs 32C frame so am returning it. Wish it came in an XS!",1
5,"Nice colors, very comfortable and well made",1
5,Very cute bikini. I am 5’5” 130 32DD and ordered a medium. fits great and got lots of compliments!,1
5,Very good service  and product highly recommended,1
5,"Ease to connect, watch band is very soft and comfortable.  this band match perfect with the blue aluminum case.",1
4,Love the purse. Not what I was expecting but definitely going to recommend this purse.,1
4,Comfortable and light to wear.<br />Wish there was more tummy suck!,1
1,This dress was atrocious. It looks nothing like the picture. It’s a spandex kind of material which makes it look very cheap. In the picture it hits just below the knee but when I tried it on it was to my calves. I ordered a small but it fit more like a large. Very disappointed with this purchase.,0
2,Showed up with a hole in one of the pairs. Rather disappointed,0
5,Simply adorable!  Very happy!,1
5,Good fit.  Cute.,1
5,Very comfortable fabric and size as expected.,1
5,"The product was really great and came in a reusable, tough bag so that the cubs do not get squished and the free gift was awesome! The bras were really sticky but didn't move or hurt to remove. It works well for busty women and keeps everything in place. I would for sure order again!",1
5,I love my sunglasses! They were packaged perfectly!,1
2,Already broken. Sucks because they’re cute but the letter already broke off then today this one broke. I wore them for one day on our vacation 😞,0
2,Cute but too small,0
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!,1
1,"! Purchased 3 shirts . The white shirt is at least 5cm longer than the other two.<br />The sizes of all shirts are not quite right. Across the chest they are about a size L, waist about 3XL<br />and the bottom band are not elastic enough.",0
5,Fun!!,1
2,"The band came on time, but wasn’t exactly was described in the info. It was very flimsy and was very hard to put on the watch.",0
5,Love Lottie Dotties they are great. Mix and match your accessories. The pink mix is very vibrant. Really like the colors.,1
5,Hubby loves them.,1
4,they're ok,1
5,Looks great nice little charm,1
5,Bought this for my mom. She can't wear watches and likes clip ons for her golf bag and purse. She says this is very nice.,1
5,enjoy it,1
2,The color was perfect but too small,0
3,These are nice.  Would have liked them to be a bit more bulky or thicker.  Satisfied in any event.,0
5,"Perfect fit, received lots of compliments!",1
5,Love these jeans. So very comfortable and the fit is fantastic.,1
5,Love this dress! My daughter looked stunning. Very elegant and conservative.,1
1,What appeared to be red tinted glasses with the gradients are brown. Very misleading.<br /><br /> Not returning it because my shipping cost is greater than the cost of the item and not worth my time to ship it.,0
1,If I could give it negative stars I would!<br />Nothing at all like the image on Amazon-So huge and like a cable knit grandpa sweater-,0
3,Very short and small order up,0
5,Beautiful Murano glass as always from this company.,1
2,does not auto close. feels flimsy. will return,0
3,"Super bulky, the shoes are overall cute, just not my style.",0
5,Just what I was looking for. Ordered a large & it fit perfectly. Can't wait to wear it to Disneyland. Thanks,1
5,Took a chance and I really love this casual dress.,1
1,"different style but close to the picture, arrived 3 months later, too late in the return window to return.",0
5,"The picture is slightly misleading as it is not as &#34;shiny and golden&#34; but it is more pewter gold  as it is displayed but it looks really nice.  The chain is gold colored, the goblet itself is rather large to be warn as a necklace piece. I bought it to have it hang from my rear view mirror which worked perfectly fine.<br /><br />Must have for any Hufflepuff or HP fan.",1
4,It was lovely however snapped in two peices but I'm still enjoying the earrings.,1
3,It’s pretty. But because of that I was afraid to wrap it. But you got to basically grip it to death to close it nicely again. Not to mention that it’s pretty tight. I get leather wallets when you buy them new but not umbrellas. So it can be hard to open it and close. I think maybe after a few days it will loosen but it’s rainy season and it wasn’t a gift for someone to use next year. It was for me and right away. I had to give up and run without this. Double and triple check it if you want a pretty but under normal umbrella.,0
1,cheap basic material. Not at all what I thought. It's basic enough that I could just throw it on with whatever but I am disappointed by the flimsy material.,0
3,"Ordered a 42FF. Seems true-to-size. Looks smooth under t-shirts. The underwires are wide on me, but are, I suspect, for average root width (I'm narrow). In front, the straps are anchored as far apart as I could possibly wear (yeah, I know, it's a balconette, so they will be far apart, but they're REALLY far apart.) The lace is soft enough, but I find that with the straps extended all the way (which is usual for me) the adjustment clips are scratchy on my back.  I would also comment that the photo is showing a model who either has implants that don't need support, or the model is wearing another bra under this one and they photoshopped it out--this bra is just not that supportive.",0
3,"A little more clear than I was expecting, but still looks pretty nice",0
5,"Wore to a wedding, I had a lot of compliments on the dress. Very satisfied with this purchase.",1
2,"This was the black version. One if the above pics looks light gray. It is more washed out due to flash. The shirt is still, however, more gray than the black in their provided picture. I would be totally fine with that except that the fabric looks completely different than their pictures. The fabric in the picture drapes nicely and looks like most of the texture is in the fabric itself. The actual shirt is completely different. It is essentially like a less stretchy tee shirt material.  The texture is entirely printed onto the fabric. Looks like a light stone wash.  The shirt looks okay, but not nearly as cool as the shirts in the pictures. I was very disappointed.",0
3,"These are pretty, but cheaply made. The beads fell off with the first wear and continue to do so.",0
2,Gave it as a Christmas Gift and still couldn't give it away to anyone else.  Just didn't work like I expected.,0
1,"anybody who buys clothes from them, they make the clothes so small, your kid would probably fit the shirt. don't buy from them, they say their in China and the shipping to return it would cost a lot, and they'll only give you 4 dollars or so back for it. Its a total SHAM!!!",0
5,I am very pleased with the High 3 Pcs Cap Cleaning Set.  This product does clean up dust well and it seems to prevent dust from returning to my hats.,1
5,Buena calidad,1
1,"Very disappointed, it was broken when  I opened it Trash! DO NOT BUY WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!! THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!",0
3,"It's a very pretty chain, but it bends a little, and doesn't really have a shine to it, no weight to it really. But it's definitely worth what I paid for it.",0
5,"My daughter loves these boots, so I'm assuming they're comfortable. They've held up well and look great.",1
1,Design and fabric not flattering to the body.,0
3,It was a good purchase,0
3,Cheap looking for my taste. Too many beads. And then it burst. I wear one row now. Looks better.,0
5,I own 7 pairs (maybe 8) lol....of Buddha pants and I LIVE IN THEM DAILY! as a regular yoga practitioner they are fantastic for any type movement exercise or hobby! Please don't wait....getcha some NOW! you will NOT regret!,1
3,Not as comfortable than I had hoped,0
3,the buckle broke on the side after wearing 3 times,0
5,great,1
3,I didn't care for the ring to be stationery.  It should of been loose on the cube in order to help with keeping the glasses in place. Not too crazy about it.,0
5,Cute and fits great,1
5,These are the coolest belt buckles I have ever seen - I picked up two!,1
2,This is cute but the fabric is very thin. The workmanship is sub-standard.,0
2,"My daughter made me lol. I ordered an extra large as suggested uping in size I normally wear a m/l it fit okay the arms are a bit too big (loose fitting) and the legs as well and it showed an awful camel toe I plan on wearing leggings on top. But I am not even that tall 5'2"" and it just rose up so high. It'll work this time but I don't plan on wearing it again or ordering costumes from this brand again.",0
5,Was a gift to my husband who is a huge fan of Futurama.. He loves it,1
3,"I'm conflicted about this product I ordered on in October that was soft fit perfect I think next level or something good like that, it was stolen from someone within 3 weeks... ordered a new on it was ""damaged on delivery"" took 3 weeks to tell me that finally got it a 3rd time beginning of December but it's fruit of the loom. Maybe to undercut for Xmas but damn the sleeves are tight and don't go past my wrist like the first one and the material is coarse the design looks good still but 1st time 10/10 this time maybe 6/10. Aaahhhh!",0
5,These earrings are beautiful.  They are not as big as I thought....be sure to read the description.,1
2,Cute and comfy but stains SOO easily and nothing will get the stains off... not very practical.,0
5,Really nice,1
5,I love the size of the purse and it is made well.,1
3,"It is fine for training, I can see how the armholes might chafe a larger person, I ordered a small and I am a 130 lb person. Good material.",0
1,It is very it's very bad very small like infant size cumbered with pic  it's look like infant size,0
5,It's Vera Bradley...nuf said!!!,1
4,"These are too small for my legs, but they are very pretty.  Keeping them.  Someday they will fit!",1
1,This is what it looks like after 5 weeks of daily use.  I bought this because of the good reviews but this is not acceptable quality!  Past 30 days so no returns allowed for me 😬,0
1,It was all bend to one side,0
1,Could not apply to my feet.  Instructions say to roll down and pull on feet.  Problem is when I rolled it down the inside was too small to pull up over my foot.,0
5,"I love it,  but not for the chain it makes me itchy and rush on my neck💜💜💞💞",1
5,"ITs so warm! Love it, so in love with it",1
2,Very itchy material,0
2,"...at least, I have not yet figured it out.  It is as cumbersome as not using anything to help is undoable!",0
5,nice,1
5,"This necklace is just as pictured, and very pretty.  I was expecting it to be on the heavy side and feel like it is pulling at my neck, but it doesn't.",1
1,Quality not expected,0
4,My husband loves them...,1
5,I love this outfit it’s a nice material I’m wearing a medium i ordered a large at 1st but it was way to big so i sent it back I’m 36ddd and I’m 170 pounds 5’9 height hope this helps you out 😊,1
5,I bought this for my daughter. My husband who currently just passed away from suffering with Esophageal cancer for 2 1/2 years who loved Space Jam. She wanted them to remember her dad's favorite thing.,1
2,Didn’t come in a box just a plastic bag thing which was broken open also. The necklace is a lot thicker than it shows in the picture,0
5,Wow!! Good quality latex!! Looks Better than expected!! I’m ready for Halloween!!!,1
2,Looks cheap.,0
5,"Great fit, prevents my feet from getting sore during 12 hour shifts!",1
5,Lightweight... not true to size (had to return),1
4,Working great,1
1,"Too short and the material after 1st wash on gentle cycle  it,<br />Completely became shreds! Don’t buy",0
1,Great until it broke after two months,0
2,I didn’t like the material nor the fit.,0
1,Buyer beware. ZERO STARS.. Poor quality... not a true compression sock.  Design distorted when feet are in socks.  Ink scratches off fabric.  I should’ve known the price was to good to be true.  To much money and trouble to send back overseas.,0
5,These are great undershirts and friction free when exercising.,1
5,Love this brand! I’m a fan and this will be the only company I purchase my husband briefs and socks from..,1
5,Awesome ring,1
3,Not very comfortable,0
3,These run very small I ordered the size I normally wear and it was too small so I ordered a size larger and it was still too small,0
3,"I have already reviewed this dress.  It is very pretty, the fabric and print are very nice.  However, it is very poorly made.  There are a lot of frayed fabric ends, especially at the waist.  I normally wear a size XL, but I purchased this dress in a XXL because of past experience with this style.  I also purchased it because of the price, as I am a seamstress and can make the necessary adjustments.",0
5,"I found the one hat in Branson MO.  A freind of mine liked it so much I searched amazon, found it, and gave it to him as a gift.  Excellent hat,",1
3,"My 7 year old loved the pattern, but it keeps slipping off. It could have been a good one if it  stayed on.",0
5,"U guy have no idea how many people have given me compliments on this product. Not to mention, GIRLS head turns lol Looks great, just keep it clean to make it shine everyday... WOW!!",1
2,"See through,  it has a cheap feel, I would pass.  Would be kind of cute for Halloween in all seriousness.",0
4,"Unfortunately, they were too small to try on so I returned them.",1
1,"Material is very cheap, don't look as good in person as it did on the picture.",0
1,I purchased this in XL. It didn’t even fit over my head the waist bend was so small. Also the material was pretty cheap.,0
5,Great for travel,1
3,Loved the style . My granddaughter wears a size 8. I ordered a sz . 8 1/2 . To small . Fits like a 7 1/2 .,0
2,"Could smell it even before I opened the package , Hung it in the garage for 4 days , still smelled , soaked it in water and hung outside for 3 days , damn thing still smells . Good belt if you can get over the overpowering smell !",0
5,Wonderful fit. Would definitely recommend.,1
1,VERY short not long like it shows to be on the model,0
5,Is very loose fitting that makes it comfortable and easy to wear.,1
5,This necklace is just beautiful ! The chain is very delicate and it makes it look more expensive than it is. I absolutely love it.,1
3,"Bangles are beautiful but the color rubs off on your skin. Also, glitter gets all over the place.",0
1,Sent me the wrong piece of clothing. I got some ugly Bantu top in an XL. Like. Ok.,0
5,"Used this on a two and a half week trip through London, England and various cities in India. The bag can hold so much, the only issue is that I would get carried away and put too much and the straps were not meant to carry a heavy load. Aside from that, the back zipper feature is a great anti theft tool and I felt my belongings were very safe. (Pom Pom is also cute as hell)",1
1,The underwear was not a true X,0
5,FIT AND LOOKS GOOD,1
3,I ordered my size and it was too small that is the only trouble with ordering online.,0
4,Definitely get measurements before buying. Tough material. The neck part is very tough and almost digs into neck buuuut WORTH the buy for smallville/Superman fans. Looks exactly like picture. Very cool! Heavy material. Functional!,1
5,Awesome little ring!,1
3,Runs very small... giving to my daughter since it doesn't fit me.,0
5,This is nice. Lightweight. And comfortable,1
5,Great value.,1
4,Very comfortable.,1
5,My daughter was a big panic at the disco fan and fell in love with this shirt. She wore it frequently and I’m impressed the brightness of the color never faded.,1
5,Fit the bill but we’re heavy to wear,1
4,Cute little bag for a princess; my best friends granddaughter loved it. Okay price,1
4,"This is a super cute floral print maxi, perfect for fall. I love the bold large flower pattern, and the 3/4 sleeves have a great tie accent. The fabric is thin and slinky. Much slinkier than I had expected but still comfortable. I wear about a size 6 and the size medium dress feels slightly large on me but still looks good worn a little looser. There is also an elastic in the back for stretch which might suit someone who wears a size 8.",1
1,These are way too tight and thick. Maybe ok for children?,0
1,I opened the package and the earrings were in pieces and the was pieces missing very disappointing.,0
1,Bad quality,0
5,"no issues, fast shipping.  super cute",1
2,"These drawstring pants are cute and were almost perfect, except for one major design flaw.<br />*This review is about the light grey with black leg stripe. Not all the styles are constructed the same.*<br />There is a 2 inch wide elastic band in the waist band. The drawstring is basically a decorative addition. This band of elastic is tight and not easily forgiving. I have a very small waist, so it’s not terrible when I am standing (& maybe sucking in my gut a little), but the moment I sit and relax, it’s pretty tight on my mid-section. For reference, I am 5’4”, 108lbs, 26” waist. I bought the small.<br />The length is great. I love that there are pockets. And as for the rest of the pant, it is cute, fairly comfortable, and good for walking/yoga/lounging. The material is lightweight, but not see through.<br /> It’s just too bad that there is an uncomfortable, unforgiving, wide band of elastic at the waist.<br />Make sure you look closely at the photos provided here to see the waistline. Some of them look like the drawstring is sewn in properly and that they might have more give at the waist, where others (like the pair I bought) just have a plain looking waist band.<br />I honestly should have returned them and gotten another pair of the Amazon Terry Joggers, but I waited too long. Maybe I can find someone who knows how to sew to take the elastic band out and then I could use the drawstring as it’s intended.",0
2,the cut of this dress is definitely as shown. its very tight where the upper straps are so my fianc&eacute; and I cut it up and created something more suitable and comfortable to wear. perfect beach material,0
3,"It looks great in the picture.  Maybe it's better suited for a taller woman ?  It just felt like too much material for me.  I'm 5'2 and about 46 kg, for reference and I was' swimming' in it.",0
5,Very nice fit,1
4,Got for my wife.  She's happy!,1
5,"Such nice socks. Warm, but not too warm, smooth &amp; soft. This is a quality product.",1
5,Big Fan!,1
5,great quality for small price !!,1
5,My mom loves her little Casio watch. Is super comfy she said.,1
5,Best,1
5,Exelente,1
5,"The leather in this shoe is so soft you barely notice you're wearing it, except that the bottom is hard enough to keep sharp things out of the soles of your feet. The soles mold to your foot, too. Best shoe ever",1
5,Fit properly and looks good.,1
3,lightweight plastic nothing fancy,0
2,I should have read the description better. This is a very small sword. More for a costume. Not what I had anticipated.,0
3,"I loved this bag initially very cute, big, bold!”Loved it. But the straps haven’t held up as well as I had expected they would:(",0
3,This is a nice looking bracelet.  It doesn't look cheap and the weight and shape are nice.,0
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY ... Bought one then it broke 2 days after I got it so the sent me a replacement and that one broke THE SAME DAY I GOT IT.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY....,0
2,"Very pretty, but the 3T shirt was way too big and arrived stained. Flowers fell off the headband in less than an hour.",0
5,Good quality,1
5,"Easy to set up, comes with stopwatch for min & sec., 24 hr clock, date tracker. The color is pretty nice. Very quiet watch as well.",1
5,Love them.,1
5,So happy with this T-shirt I just love it,1
5,I bought them for my sister who exercises a lot and always ends up with sweat pouring down her face and getting into her eyes. The bands seem to soak up all the sweat at the source and leave her face completely dry. The only possible negative is that she says they are a little small.,1
3,"All in all, this cosplay is okay if you are mostly wanting just her skirt and top. As a 5’8 person who weighs about 140 lbs the top was a tad too big but the skirt was fine. The accessories on the other hand are not the best quality. The bow is not spread out like Tenko’s; rather it sits like a normal bow and you would have to pin it to sit properly. It’s not very big either. The buttons on the clothes are fragile, but as a cosplayer, I’m used to that kind of thing. The headband is cheap plastic, and the choker is not adjustable. The socks have a weird seam throughout the entire sock, so it is pretty uncomfortable to wear. Other than that, if you are creative you can definitely make it work. I don’t recommend buying it unless you are okay with that.",0
1,Looked nothing like Pic,0
3,Lovely necklace.,0
3,The pictures made it seem more durable and in person it's kind of cheep looking. Like something from the dollar tree .,0
5,Very clear for driving I have a big head they fit great nice sun glasses,1
5,Love this,1
5,"I love it.  However, I did have to purchase supplies to extend the length as I have large ankles.  My ankles take about a 10&#34; anklet.",1
2,It came broken 😔😔,0
3,Beware sizes are for junior/kid sizes and not for adults,0
2,The suitcases are beautiful! I followed the instructions to reset the lock and one side unlocked while the other didn’t....<br />Very disappointed! Plus I didn’t receive my free gift?!,0
3,Design is iron on quality.  Not very soft.i,0
5,This is a beautiful mask! I can’t wait to give them as Christmas gifts this week! It’s great quality with beautiful rhinestones.,1
5,Wonderful piece of jewelry!!! I love the distinct style and the versatility. I'll recommend your site to others in the future.,1
2,Love them but only received 2 of 3 pair. No way to contact seller without prompting a return. Would like the third pair as advertised.,0
1,The cardigan was small the material was extra thin. The pants looked way big It felt like a kids Halloween costume from Wal-Mart I doubt this much honesty is accepted I apologise for the 1 star review but if I read a review like this I'd know that this item isn't for me,0
1,"It's thin, clingy and unflattering.  Don't bother.",0
3,They are comfy but way to long and large.,0
5,Ok,1
4,"A pretty good suit, especially for the price.",1
5,"I got so many compliments on this dress. I ordered an XL. I'm 5'9&#34; and my pants size is a 14. The XL dress fits perfectly. Beautiful colors, soft fabric. Great Dress",1
2,Tie fell apart after 2nd wear. Cheap mechanics.,0
5,Sturdy and fits perfectly. It will almost certainly fit you as well unless your head is a watermelon.,1
5,I loved this dress and got so many compliments on it. I wore it to a wedding. It was so comfortable and the fit was perfect.,1
2,"These are pretty inexpensive so value i guess is okay, but I am disappointed in the material.  They seem to be made of pretty cheap vinyl and they have a heavy odor.  The vinyl also seems heavier than other materials out there.  I purchased 4 sets at once, I wish I did not.  The issue with ordering online is you don't get to feel prior to purchasing so you just do it off the reviews and these seem really high, not sure why.  I wonder how much more these weigh than high end products per cubic foot. I purchased mine directly from the Bagail.",0
1,Broke before I even made it out of the house.  Guess I can be thankful it happened there than at the event.,0
5,"After 3 attempts to find the right fit for my granddaughter, the shoes we finally purchased fit perfectly and she loves them.  They are the cutest shoes I have ever seen and she chose those shoes to wear for every outing!  Adorable.",1
5,"These are beautiful. Good quality, good size, easily the focal point of my purse now.",1
3,Watch doesn't work anymore.  Took to lo al  Diagnostics cost more than a watch!!,0
2,Thin and not in the least bit warm.,0
4,"[[VIDEOID:996eec07011c048b560997d921bba35c]] This top is very cute!! I love the way it looks on me when the sleeves are placed in the right spot.<br /><br />Unfortunately,  the sleeves don't stay in place and when they slide up the shirt no longer looks flattering.  I'm trying to find a way I can keep them in place.<br /><br />Overall, the top is made well and is very cute. It can be worn in casual and professional settings. I like it even though it slides up!",1
4,"The material itself is very light, soft and comfy; however, the white band going around the legs is extremely restrictive. When you're moving around at night, the shorts creep up like all shorts when you're sleeping and it starts to cut off the circulation, which wakes you up. I've tried several times to sleep in these, but it's become painful.",1
5,Very warm and soft.  I really like these gloves.,1
3,"I really had liked the jeans until the zipper pull tab totally came off one of the sides of the jeans as I grabbed it to zip it up, lucky for me i had a shirt long enough to cover the zipper that day.",0
5,"When you live in south Florida, owning clothing that breathes and moves with you is very important to your overall comfort throughout the day. One of the reasons I really have enjoyed owning this shirt is because it feels a lot like it is made from athletic performance material. I am 5'3&#34; tall and have a size 36DD chest and I ordered this shirt in a size XL. The overall fit is absolutely perfect. The modest crew neck sits low enough that it is not too tight or constricting around the neck. The fabric the shirt is made from is soft and stretchy and it does not bind under the arms or around the chest. I also like that the cut for the torso is not too form fitting, so that my &#34;not as firm as it used to be belly&#34; isn't accentuated. The seams are all sewn tight and straight with no loose threads or gaps. I can see this becoming my favorite &#34;go to&#34; shirt to relax in and wear on my days off from work.",1
2,"Poor quality better examples are available for a similar price from other sellers and outlets , the clasp is going to be a downgrade on basisly any watch its moved to add too this that the item is extremely light on a standerd 40 mm 165 gm about watch this item is extremely unbalanced feeling unless its a seiko 5 then this braclet will be a downgrade",0
5,"Fit my glasses perfectly.  Easy on, easy off, and love the flip-up ability of the shades!",1
1,Hideous. Cheap. Nasty. Save your money,0
5,Brilliant,1
1,"cheesy looking, and cheap.",0
2,The short is nice but much larger than I expected for a small. I have been unable to return it as well because I can’t seem to get the address to return it in anything but Chinese.,0
5,This Dress was just Beautiful on me..My Husband and I celebrated 23yrs of Marriage the dress was the talk of the night.,1
5,This shirt is nice. it’s got an interesting texture that makes it cooling even if it’s super hot out.,1
4,"Nice jacket, for the price.",1
5,I think I love them more 😍! The cutest shoes ever!,1
5,"I have worn this almost every day for the past 4 months and it has held up spectacularly even through rain, sun, and snow. I am currently looking at buying another one in black from the same company.",1
1,Id buy it if you need something cheap to use maybe twice at the most. Both necklaces fell apart out of the package and I had to use glue and jewelry pliers to repair it.<br /><br />The chains came off and the bows were poorly glued so they came off too.<br /><br />It'll last you for cosplay pictures.,0
5,"I bought this for my birthday party. It was comfortable and slightly stretchy. I am 190lbs and 5'4"". It was a little short for me, but doable.<br />You definitely have to wear skin toned underwear to, otherwise it's see-through...",1
2,"Size was smaller than expected, didn’t fit and was too narrow",0
2,This shirt is Blue not the right color,0
5,I bought this for my daughter's boyfriend who is a big Baylor fan.  He was very happy when he opened it.  It fit well and he wore it all of the rest of the day.,1
1,"The product is very warm... I leave unzipped when temps reach 40. I was very pleased for the first 2 weeks, but then the zipper failed. This is a double zipper and the bottom zip pops loose, and the zipper unravels from bottom to the top zipper.<br /><br />I have had other coats fail, but I expected this one to last more than 2 weeks.",0
3,I ordered the L shaped studs but got the corkscrew ones instead. Still look good and still work for my piercing. Love the size variety for the hoops.,0
5,So adorable! Fit my 6 month old perfectly! Great quality!!,1
5,I love this bag with all my heart it takes awhile to arrive but when it does I actually love it,1
1,Runs very small,0
5,Love the item,1
5,Nice and easy dress to wear. It looks great to wear to party or just casual,1
5,Buy it.,1
2,Really awkward if you have breast larger than a C. The tie goes across your breast instead of waist. It just looks like it is wrong. Nice color though.,0
3,"I returned this product because this sandal have smell, and bad quality.",0
2,"I liked the fabric even though it fit better than expected. I washed it once, and now it's covered in black spots, unlike the other clothes in the same washer.",0
2,"Quality isn't that great and it kept falling apart, Requested a refund.",0
3,"Nice,but I got all the same size chains. Would of liked the 3 different sizes that I thought  I was getting.",0
5,I have worn the earrings & cross 3 times since Xmas & received compliments each time.<br />I purchased the Emerald. The color is rich . The chain study. Very happy.,1
1,"The earrings snapped in half as I was trying to open them a little. The set looks cute, would probably be good for a 10 year old. Very similar to my kids play jewelery. I’m betting it lasts a month.",0
5,Love this its perfect!,1
5,"The quality of the material used is great? The fit was as expected and the feel of the dress is amazing! I also like that the dress is a little heavy. Not uncomfortably so, but just enough to keep the dress looking the way its supposed to!",1
5,Nice adidas duffel bag.,1
5,"I had read some of the reviews and decided to order a smaller size than I wear and it was perfect.  I wear a 2X, so I ordered Xl, and it is still very comfortable, so if I lose or gain weight, it will still fit.  It's not too thin or too thick, it is perfect. I love it.  I now own 6 skirts total and each one is great.  I would definitely order again!",1
3,"Lace wasn’t sewn on all the way, otherwise it’s good quality.",0
4,"Beautiful and soft, but hand washing suggestion and price discouraged me from keeping.  Plus decided I didn’t often wear long sleeves.",1
4,"This paintball vest is well suited for many types of players. It has 2 large front pockets. I personally carry a rag and a flexible squeegie inside of it. It has the pull down map/ID pocket. And a large zipper pocket (underneath the 2 large front pockets). The vest has 4 straps for adjustment to fit your frame. The 2 on the shoulder to adjust the height and 2 on the side to adjust the width. (1 strap on the left kidney, 1 on your left shoulder, 1 on your right shoulder, 1 on your right kidney).<br /><br />As for paintball pods, it comes with 4 pods but can carry up to 6. Both your left and right are 2+1 pouches. It has a air tank holder as well, but I always used mine to carry pods I found on the ground.<br /><br />Overall very nice. I removed a star because after 1 scenario and 2 days of regular play, the mesh interior has begun show signs of heavy abuse while no other area looks as bad.",1
5,"My daughter loves this belt! Perfect, in her 20yo opinion.",1
3,"This is more for a lanky, thin guy than a big, tall man.",0
2,The interior of sock is very uncomfortable. There are rough areas on the metallic fibers at the seam above the toes and the excess fiber material feels like there is something in the socks that doesn't belong.,0
5,Extremely comfortable and flattering dress.,1
5,very comfortable. legs feel better wearing them. light weight is also appreciated.,1
5,Fit my daughter perfect. She was happy with the look n fit .,1
4,nice product,1
5,Good stuff.,1
5,"Affordable, strong arms, can see through them nicely. Can wear these as normal sunglasses. Perfect for costume though",1
2,"Really long, could not fit in my nose. But I might not have done it correctly",0
3,"I like it, but it falls off of my eat constantly. If I sneeze, it slips off of the top of my ear and yanks on my earlobe. It is cool, though. I also wish that it had slightly more detail, as people keep mistaking it for one of those hands free Bluetooth headsets. It was cheap though, so I can't complain too much.",0
1,How it was sewn is terrible . Seams twisted,0
3,"My purse is beautiful and the strap is very comfortable which is what I was looking forward to.  Until today, nine months later, I have been very happy with the design and quality of the purse; however, today I discovered that one of the seams on the interior lining had come apart leaving a hole.  I was really hoping this bag would last a year or two.",0
3,"I like the dress and it's very comfortable, the only thing about it that I'm unhappy with is that it's larger than expected and longer than expected.<br /><br />I'll have to hem it and take in the sides. Great price, though.",0
5,"I've had this band on my daily-wearer Casio Diver for about a year now and it still looks great.  Putting it on was a bit tight like others here have said and it's best to use the spring bars that come with it because these are a bit bendable. I've never had any problems with the band coming loose.  The band is solid, easy to adjust and the release button works well.  It makes my Casio almost emulate the Seiko Diver(which costs in excess of $300). This band presents as very good quality and functionality and is a steal at this price.  I'd buy this again tomorrow if something were to happen to my present one. Highly recommended",1
3,All the charms were in a weird spot on the bracelet. Cute and came in on time. Nice stocking stuffer,0
3,"I like very much how soft these  are and they aren't overly hot like many yoga pants.  They have pretty much zero tummy control if you're looking for that.  Love the pockets.  The pockets and legs do get baggy fairly quickly, I had to keep pulling them up after a full day of wear.  Overall a good value for the price.",0
5,"I love the bottoms and skirt, perfect fit and was exactly what I've been looking for, the top was a bit big but overall I'm happy with my purchase.",1
5,"I bought one pair for my son and one for myself, specifically to use for the Tough Mudder. Worked great! Light, and dried out quickly. No chafing on our 10 mile event. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price point.<br /><br />FYI- Don't expect the compression to fit super tight like other compression shorts. These fit snug without being tight; which I like. My son was a diver in high school and was expecting them to feel a lot tighter. However, he got use to them and they worked out great.",1
1,Broke after thee months of light use. Was originally very happy with this.,0
5,Love the length and the neckline,1
1,Not<br />Cute<br />At<br />All,0
2,"These are extremely loose shorts.  While the waist sizing is OK, the amount of material in the butt and legs is enough for a guy twice my size.  I won't be buying these again.",0
5,LOVE it!,1
5,"I received my motor buddy very quickly like, rolled a few times with him and he's there still kicking cool little keychain I recommend you guys to buy.",1
3,"wasnt the best fit for me, it fit me, just didnt look right on me, im a size16/18 and i got 3x",0
5,Bought as a gift and was what I expected,1
5,Used for my maternity baby shower dress and it was perfect. The ribbon is long enough and looked great with a bow on the back once I tied it.,1
3,I have very thick hair and the holder seemed small.,0
3,"This is the first time I have purchased a pair of earrings like this one which goes along your ears instead of dangling down.  It was very hard for me to put on.  It took me over half-an-hour.  It is a different feel.  It really hurt my ears, but it is beautiful, thoe.",0
1,Fits much smaller than listed.  I usually like things to fit smaller but this was way to small. It fit my 7 year old. Plus it is very thin as well. I returned immediately.,0
1,No support made flimsy.,0
5,Nicely made. Beautiful material. Very colorful perfect for my moms Hawaii trip! Was a little too long for my short mom had to hem about 5 inches.,1
1,This product was returned already. Poor workmanship,0
5,"Durable, attractive umbrella!<br />I bought it for my son, as he loves camo! And we loved it so much, I bought one for my husband and myself in different colors!",1
1,It’s plastic NOT REAL NONE! I live faraway from the nearest UPS STORE so I’m not driving with these 2 plastic fish hooks with the gas prices so high so I threw it away!,0
5,No more busting up my finger nail and wasting 5 minutes on overly sturdy keychain rings anymore. After a few months they haven’t deformed or anything either.,1
3,It’s cute but it’s huge! My daughter isn’t going to fit this for at least a year. So order it small if you want it to fit now!,0
5,This has become baby’s favorite outfit.  So easy to slip on and she looks beautiful!  Washes well and doesn’t shrink up.  Perfect.,1
5,I'm super happy with my purchase! The print is even more beautiful in person and it feels like it will last me a long time.,1
3,Is very tight for the size its suppose to be.  Love the adjustable straps and front closure.,0
5,Good for oversea children’s centers,1
3,"I ordered a Large as am an 8 in jeans however it was too small around the leg area, if you are curvy and are used to wearing strechy jeans and pants this is not for you (they dont have anything bigger than a L&#34;, the material is not a strechy material at all. They are really cute though, well made, just wish I could have worn them.",0
5,This is perfect!,1
5,My granddaughter is in love with this,1
1,Very inconsistent quality. Seams began to unravel on some of the bandanas after the first wash. If you want quality do not buy.,0
2,I had to return these because the size did not fit as expected.,0
5,"It is bright and beautiful. I order size as recommended and was extremely big, so order true to your size... but it really is festive, Christmassy, and pretty ""ugly"" dress.  An XL would have fit perfectly.",1
5,Love it,1
1,Not 2” as advertised and doesn’t lock as described.,0
1,the mens ring broke the first day,0
3,"This watch has its good and bad points. Overall, it is definitely well worth the few dollars you'll pay for it. It keeps great time, and isn't that really the main function you want in a watch? If not, and looks is your main function, this watch surprisingly delivers there, too. From any distance, this watch could easily be mistaken for an actual expensive name-brand piece. It's a Chinese made watch, made with a quality Japanese Miyota movement. One thing I don't like is the uni-directional bezel. It's chrome-plated plastic (or at least, it feels and looks like it), only has 60-clicks, and worst of all, it is very loose. Once set, it reverse rotates a lot before being caught by the cog. It is loose, compared to any other rotating bezel I've owned or seen. The band is rolled flat steel. It has three adjuster holes (nice!) and a dual side-button release clasp. Nothing great, but certainly not a bad band. Better than most Chinese metal watch bands, that's for sure. It's even better than some metal bands I've seen on brands such as Fossil and Diesel. Luminous dial hands. The back states, &#34;Water Resistant,&#34; but does not show a rating. A little research shows 30m, but with a pop-on case back, I certainly wouldn't risk this watch in any water situation beyond light rain. For an inexpensive watch, this one is definitely higher quality than most Chinese-made pieces. It's heavier, thus feels a bit tougher, has a better band than most, has working day and date, and looks great. Just don't mistake this for a Seiko or a Citizen. It's not near that caliber of quality. But, for the price, you're definitley getting your money's worth.",0
1,Never received the product do not buy!!! Took two month to not even receive them,0
4,"Fits a little small -  would have liked the next size.  No access to inside pockets if wearing over other clothes.<br />So far, it wears well",1
5,If you are tired of putting in reading glasses and then taking them off to see everything else......these bad boys are just for you!  These glasses do exactly what they advertise.  You can see very crisp clean.  You just have to get some and try them out.  Excellent quality.  Im buying more!,1
3,My daughters just moved up a shoe size. They're wearing kids 7 and 12. All their other 7 and 12 shoes have wiggle room. I bought these shoes to go with their Christmas outfits. I had to cram their feet into them. They were wearing tights and the shoes still barely fit. Very narrow. Very small. Buy one size up!!!,0
3,Nice,0
3,"The necklace is easily tangled when wearing it, the two chains roll together. Otherwise its a nice simple necklace.",0
2,"Looks really cute, but not durable by any means!  It was broken within the first 5 minutes, did not even make it to school working.  The wires pulled right out of the battery pack when my child was trying to take it out of the pouch to turn it off.  Definitely not durable for kids. We had one very disappointed kid.",0
4,"Love it! Love all the outside pockets, wish it came in more colors!",1
5,"Fit well on temples of several pairs of sunglasses that I have. Well made, comfortable.",1
3,It looks good for 1st 3 days but doesn’t stay fasten.,0
1,"Clips wouldn't stay on my shirt, metal clasp to adjust length broke within a month or two. Would not buy again",0
1,"I was disappointed that the trumpet is flat on the back side. It was described as ""an exact replica""; hmmm... I don't think I've ever seen a trumpet that is flat on one side.",0
2,I ordered this in black for my twins in size 2-4.  They are wearing 2T and these are way way way too small.  I compared the sizing to their other leotards and what I ordered was more like their 12-18m leotards.  These will be going back although they seemed like they were made from a good quality material.,0
5,Husband loved it.,1
2,Don't buy it,0
4,They were perfect for our event and made a splash at the Color Run!,1
1,These glasses are falsely advertised as being polarized.,0

1,"It's a pretty bracelet but I haven't noticed a difference in my mood or healing... I thought they were healing beads? My husband and I have worn our bracelets every day since we received them. UPDATE: We bought a new bracelet that’s actually real stones and they look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. These are fake stones, they don’t work. Don’t waste your money.",0
4,"The cap is off decent quality,  not great quality.  The description fails to state if the logo is stitched or applied (not sure what that type is called) but it is applied (like screen printing). The hat is overpriced -in my opinion- compared to similar quality hats.  I think the ad on Amazon is a bit deceiving because the 2nd photo (which shows a hat from the side) shows raised stitching... but it is NOT this hat. I wish companies on Amazon would strive to be more honest in their product ads (why show a hat...in this ad... that is not this hat). This is the only Husaberg cap I have found and I probably would have purchased it (and kept it) if the ad was more transparent but,  given the addition of misleading photos,  I plan to return it.",1
4,It came when I decided to take nap....,1
1,Got as a gift for being in a wedding. Looked really cute. Go to put on and earring posts are very short. By end of the ceremony we had to take them off. The ring is very manly looking in the size and didn’t really fit us. Necklace was broken by the end of the night in two different places. Would not recommend this to anyone.,0
3,These is really nice for the price.... I love...,0
2,does not look like picture at all,0
5,"So far I just tried these on because I broke my ankle before I could try them riding a bike. The padding felt strange but it's because I never wore padded shorts before. Even though it feels a little like wearing a diaper, it doesn't look that way. The shorts conformed to my shape but were easy to put on. I say it's somewhat small because I'm usually a size smaller in other clothes so I recommend ordering a size higher than what you normally wear or go by the sizing chart. I can't wait to try them out! I will update on the comfort of the ride after my ankle heals.",1
5,"Very easy to put it in, comfortable and easy to maintain. Please try it .",1
5,Gifts for Christmas. 4 gifts makes shopping easy.,1
5,Nice dress for my daughter.,1
3,"Feels great. Fits great.  I’m never cold in it. My only complaint is that the hood is not adjustable, so it’s either blinding me or too far back. There are no strings to tighten it.",0
2,Cheap. Broke within a month,0
1,started falling apart at the seams after the first wash.,0
5,Its so warm! I will be ordering the red one soon.,1
5,Just as expected,1
1,A little small for a sz 18. And sits below the waist a little bit. Sent it back.,0
5,"The fabric is thick, stretchy and soft. I’m very happy with the fit and look.",1
1,I ordered 3X This was no 3X,0
1,After 1 wash in cold water and a front load machine the print came off in areas and smeared in other area. Not a quality product very disappointed.,0
4,"I purchased these for my outdoor event. The large base that some people have found unattractive didn't bother me at all. No one noticed that I had them unless I pointed them out. I wish that there was something inside where the heel of the shoe goes that would provide extra grip to the heel. I definitely had them fall off a couple of times. But beyond the occasional falling off and putting back on, I was pretty pleased. I can say that I did not end up poking holes in the ground with my shoes :)!",1
5,Love it thank you.,1
5,Received quickly and the bags were good quality as advertised.  My adult son loved them and used them immediately.,1
5,i love this it’s so soft and so so cute,1
2,"Looks cheap.  I had to return, although the price was fair.  The quality wasn't there.",0
3,I am just 5 4 and had to return because it was too short.,0
5,Beautiful quality ring.,1
2,The product was fine but manufacturing causes a clasp to come off. No big deal as mass production causes problems like this a lot. I messaged the company to return the item and they began getting very rude and talking to me as if I were a child. I understand not wanting to do refunds but if that's the case offer another option on the page like replace or even repair.,0
5,Used this on my Galaxy watch. Worked great,1
5,"So flattering! I wear this often! Lovely, soft material.",1
5,Fits as expected.  Bottoms appear to be a normal style vs boy short style.,1
1,Cheaply made and with such a price you should expect a black bag looking jacket. Didn't look like anything in the picture.,0
5,Look great with my Halloween costume,1
3,No support in the top. Couldn't wear. Bottoms fit good though.,0
5,My daughter wanted to get this shirt for horseback riding when the weather gets cooler.  She likes how it looks with her riding pants.,1
3,"Ordered youth size large, bag said YL, opened it up on sons birthday and sweater was YM. He loves the sweater, but unfortunately had to wait for me to exchange it for his size. :/",0
4,"I love the flow and fit of this dress. It is great if your looking for something very light weight to wear out in the sun or on a lazy day where you still want to look cute but not go overboard. The one thing that I didn't like about this dress was that it is too see through for me. I would need to add something extra underneath of this in order to be able to wear it out in public. From the photos you can see my sports bra showing underneath. Maybe a white slip or something would work, but then it takes away from the comfort since slips are not very comfortable. This would also look good as a cute easy bikini coverup if you just want something light to toss on over swimsuit. This material is not itchy or hard to care for. It is easy to wash and just hang dry which is a plus also. I recieved this dress free of charge in exchange for my honest review. If you had found this review to be helpful please click on the yes below. Thanks!",1
2,Runs two sizes too small,0
5,"I can hardly believe the price of this ring. It came beautifully presented in a velvet bag, fits perfectly and looks exactly as advertised. I would definitely buy from this seller again.",1
4,"This is exactly what I was looking for! A thick, waterproof jacket. I have yet to be able to really try it out in the rain - Portland's been getting an unusual amount of snow this year so I'm wearing a full winter jacket instead, but so far it's kept me warm on sunny 40 degree days when I've worn it.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 150 pounds and carry most of the weight in my hips and I'm glad I got the large size. Enough room in the arms to wear multiple layers underneath, but snug on my hips. Only problem I have with it is the elastic tie around the waste came slightly damaged. Still usable, I adjusted it once to fit and then plan on never touching it again in case it fully breaks.",1
1,THEY NOT WATERPROOF,0
2,I like the color but when it showed up it definitely did not have glitter on it at all like the description says I was a little disappointed.,0
5,Sending kids to Disneyland for Christmas. Putting tickets andothergiftsithebags,1
1,It’s hard to put on and the size was way to small for my daughter,0
5,Great leather band!,1
2,"I love the warmth of the sweat shirt it is very very warm. Unfortunately, the stitching is coming apart not just few stragglers there and there but on both of the ones i bought. I am returning and looking elsewhere. and for $25 a pop i'm sorry but the hanes ones are much better quality compared to this",0
3,"I followed the sizing chart. Order a size up for sure, even if you are on the small end. Skirt is a good material but the shorts underneath fit more like underwear and if I bent over even a little my whole butt would show.",0
1,No me agrado.  Se rajo con solo meter el iPad,0
5,One of the best earring it is..my friends have really given me so many compliments!!!,1
5,very nice and very well made for my protection,1
1,So cheaply made. It would never make it through the wash. Returned it.,0
1,I bought these mainly for the blavk hoops. So ive worn the black hoops about 2 weeks. I now notice the black is coming off of the earrings.  Not good.,0
2,Please be aware the dress in VERY HEAVY not suitable for summer events or warmer places. The cost to ship it back is as much as the dress. Gonna donate to a goodwill someone can use it,0
1,Very cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture…took almost a month to get it and is costing almost $30 to send it back for a refund,0
1,I would have been happy if only the watch worked. It doesn't.,0
2,Small is too long,0
1,Way to big  it was like a bracelet on my lip.,0
5,Absolutely adorable. My daughter loves  them! They've held up well against her silliness.,1
2,Ordered a 4x and gave it to my son's girlfriend who is a size medium/large.,0
5,Amazing quality for this inexpensive item! Very impressed,1
5,"Good condition!  Got it for my niece who is nuts about Sailor Moon, but is also a tomboy, so this bag gets beat up pretty well.  But it's only had cosmetic injuries thus far (smudges and scratches), but for as long as it's lasting with my niece, I'm impressed.",1
2,Size is deceiving these gloves only come up as far as where ones hand joins the wrist. I have small hands and these gloves do not cover the wrist as shown in the Amazon photo.  Otherwise these gloves will serve the purpose but they are not long whatsoever,0
5,I love the color and they fit perfectly.  They also stretch and don't pinch the skin.,1
3,"What can we say?  Issues, issues, issues.  We went with three stars, with three stars being generous.<br /><br />Let's begin with quality.  Loose strings, uneven hems, stitches that wandered, and more.  Quality borders on being unacceptable.<br /><br />Then there is the fit.  The fit is...well...interesting.  We have skirts that flow and skirts that flatter and more.  This skirt just sort of is.  For straight bodies, this skirt might work.  For everyone else, well, good luck with fit and flow.  This skirt just does not hang well from the significant other's waist, and is not very flattering.  FYI:  This skirt is supposed to stretch up to 46 inches, and the significant other is well under 46 inches.  It is possible that her small waist is part of the reason the skirt does not flatter her figure.  That sort of thing can happen with a ""one size fits most"" product.<br /><br />We also have an issue with the lining.  The lining is kind of a built-in slip, but put a bright light on the far side and suddenly this skirt becomes a see-through.  In certain lighting conditions, this skirt could be more revealing than might be desirable.  Indeed, underwear is a must with this skirt with the right ratio of back and front lighting.<br /><br />Do we have anything positive to say about this skirt?  Yes.  We like the pattern.  We like the sparkly decorations along the hemline.  We even like what the designer tried to do, though in our opinion the results came up short.<br /><br />Even though the quality is so-so, at best, this skirt requires dry cleaning.  Frankly, I think we would be embarrassed to take this skirt to the dry cleaners.  I could see the dry cleaners refusing to clean this skirt for fear that they might get blamed for the quality issues.  Or they might look at us like this skirt was the only thing we could afford, poor things.<br /><br />Our assessment of value is below average, based primarily on quality and fit for the price.  This skirt is a low-end skirt that seems to be aiming for a mid-range market, and just does not quite make it there.  Factor in dry cleaning, and our assessment of value drops further.<br /><br />Our overall rating is three stars, though we were very tempted to go with two stars.  Indeed, on a scale of 1-10 instead of Amazon's 1-5, we probably would have waffled between a 3 and a 4.  The quality is below average for this price range, and the skirt just does not hang as well as other skirts we own (which may be because of the ability to stretch up to 46 inches).  On the other hand, we actually like the colors and pattern, and the style has its plus points.  It is just that the negatives outweigh the positives for us.<br /><br />Good luck!",0
1,Keeps falling off the keys lost it twice luckily found the charm but this is not durable for a set of keys,0
4,"Very beautiful dress but too big for me. Luckily, i used it as a present and gave it to my co-worker which fit her perfectly",1
5,"I ordered my granddaughter a colorful collection of Tipi Toe socks for back to school.  After she wore them, she asked if I would buy her the same kind in all white!  She just loves them with her tennis shoes for high school days!",1
2,I did not like the fabric and it was kind of cheap.  You get what you pay for!!,0
5,It to large but i love it,1
1,Turn color.,0

1,the way it is on the body. it should desing the body,0
5,"I've been having a foot problem and someone recommended a show with an arch support.  These have a little ""bump"" that pushes in the arch and just like that ~ PAIN GONE!  Not sure about spelling this symptom but something like plantar fasciitis I believe.",1
4,"This fits nicely, except the neck is a little larger than I expected. However, it looks real cute on my boy.",1
5,Loved it and my friend I bought it for loved it too!,1
1,"Well, difficult to fill, when filled, looked okay, cheap though. In one month, innards (chemicals+breast milk) shrunk to less than 1/2. Superb glue tube was empty, not dried out. Empty. Very disappointed",0
2,"There was a hole in one of the socks, too. Pretty disappointing.",0
4,"I ordered a dark blue in Large. I am 5 ft 6 inches and weigh abt 175lbs. My bust measurement is 40 cm and my waist is 32cm. I followed the size chart, hence why I chose a large. The only reason why I never gave it 5 stars, is because the material seems almost like silk(which i was running from. But it fits me very well, hugs my curves and flows right below my ankle. I love how it makes me look flattering. Suitable for beach wear or date outdoors. the shipping was fast as I used Prime.",1
1,This is a joke - I cannot believe the seller has not been shut down or removed from amazon. I feel bad leaving this kind of feedback but I don't want any other buys wasting their time. I opened my package and there was a bright blue dress with ruffled looking sleeves almost made of a spandex material. Super cheap and would fit a 9 year old. Do not buy. :(,0
1,Cute but bill is half as long as the image,0
5,Comfy,1
5,En tiempo y forma!,1
5,Love it works great will buy more for gifts,1
5,very cute top! i’ve seen this top on other websites and this was one of the cheapest versions of it that i’ve seen. it’s super cute and perfect for summer.,1
3,"Very loud over/ around ears.<br />It’s like listening to a plastic bag over your ears, when you move your head.",0
1,This is sub-par quality department in question. I got the pant fit great but I can not fasten the button since there is no opening (hole) for the button to go through. Speechless  ..... RETURN ASAP,0
5,Nice tanks,1
4,adjustable drawstring waist,1
1,"My son was very excited to receive this item. As soon as he received the necklace he went to put his ranger crystal in and it doesn't stay, it falls right out. Now I am not able to return it because I am a day past return date, which is my fault for not paying attention.",0
5,"These earrings were exactly what I was looking for. They are classy, not too large but are sparkly. Love these earrings and plan to buy more from this seller in the future.",1
1,Checked the baggage once and the outer lining cracked. Don’t waste your money.,0
5,My daughter loves this.,1
5,How it look,1
5,"Great product, I love the wood material, I’ve been looking for some of these everywhere. I’m glad they are the ones I wanted. Thanx! Definitely recommend them!",1
5,Very pretty.,1
3,They are short and the fabric is too thin,0
3,"Me gustaron, pero en la primera vez que las uso mi pequeña se despintaron un poco de las rodillas, no me parece que sean para el uso rudo que le dan los peques :) pero si están muy lindas",0
5,I am loving my boots they are very comfortable. I brought an 8 which thats my size but I have a habit of wear to pairs of socks and they fit perfectly.,1
3,"The straps are super confusing and I feel like I spend 5 mins trying to figure out which strap goes where due to the cross straps it has to make it have a cross back.<br /><br />Other than that, it does seem to hold up pretty well after many washes and is super super supportive.",0
2,Loved the look and design but tore really quickly didn’t use it but 2 months,0
5,Also wore for the prom!,1
4,Its nice just didn't fit,1
1,Venía un poco roto,0
4,Nice pants wrong fit for my husband but on someone else might be fine,1
3,Unfortunately mine was defective but they were beautiful,0
5,AMAZING graphic. Sooo cute. AMAZING price.  Timely seller.,1
3,Fit fine but the black is pretty see through. I’ve had other pairs from90 degree in a grey color that didn’t have this problem. Won’t buy again.,0
5,Like the feel of the fabric.<br />Used for a replacement.,1
5,love it,1
1,No good,0
3,The end of the holders do not stay attached to eyeglasses.  Make sure that you use the included temple arm piece.,0
2,The sleeves were to short and the length of the body was too short. The body of the shirt is fine. They need an extra long or tall version. My husband is 6ft and 200 lbs.,0
5,"These leggings are comfortable enough for long plane rides and for hiking. My thighs are bigger than my waist to i always have to keep pulling up and adjusting my leggings, but not with these!! I wore them for a day of hiking and did not need to pull them up once!! 100% recommend",1
3,The dress fit me really well. The color actually transferred onto my white nail polish though. Just beware when washing,0
5,My 3 year old was so excited to take this to Disney World. He felt so grown up!,1
5,"Full disclosure: I received this item in exchange for my honest review. The opinions expressed in this review are my own<br /><br />I've been trying to expand my wardrobe and was delighted when I received this set to try out. Both ties look great with a dress shirt, and the bowtie is a breeze to put on; no need to tie the bow, just use the clip in the back! Similarly the pocket square is a nice accent that I otherwise don't think i would have bought, but looks great with the tie or bowtie. The material seems top-notch and looks very professional. I couldn't be happier with how this looks and feels!",1
5,Came fast and was of better quality then I had expected.,1
4,"Very pretty purse, but it's very stiff, hard to get things in and out of it. Wish it was just a little better quality, but it's very pretty",1
1,The dress is very small by two sizes and the color is not the same pink in the picture. This is very disappointing that’s the description of the dress is so off from size to color.,0
5,I'm 73 and it keeps the big boys in place. So comfortable!!,1
4,"The Power Balance Bracelet is perfect for my granddaughter athlete.  I bought similar bracelets for her siblings to enjoy, also.",1
4,Well fit was ok. They tend to want to fall down so constantly pulling up. Soft and stretchy. I had to return though. The waistband ripped. Love the colors though,1
5,I like the style of the dress. It's a little big but ok.,1
1,"The overlay of mine was sewn into the zipper on the bodysuit so I was not able to wear it. Also the straps are VERY cheap, they literally look like twine.",0
5,Love these. Super comfy. Got size 14 and fits perfect for my build (large bottom/thighs and small waist).,1
3,"I used this band for 3 months, but I changed to a Richard Tracy band last month and was shocked by the difference in quality.  The reason why I initially looked for a new band was because the inside of the band and the indents in the front kept getting dirty (white), with no obvious way of cleaning them out.  When I switched to the Richard Tracy, I found that the silicone was much more comfortable.  For this band, the silicone sometimes sticks to my wrist and seems to attract dust.  I wasn't aware of the shortcomings of this band until I changed to a different one.  However, if this is the only band you every try, it will probably meet your needs.",0
2,"There were nice boxes, but some of them were not usable. The white backing inside the box had come unglued and there was so easy way to fix it.",0
5,I would purchase again for myself or as a gift.,1
1,"i am usually a size small, so i ordered a medium (i was adviced to do so by one of the reviews). its so short i need at least 4 inches extras in the lenght(im 5'7"",  its more of a long skirt for tiny people!!! its too thin for flamenco dancing but it has pretty color!",0
3,Material is a little thin but these shirts runs size small so order 1 size bigger.,0
5,"Wasn't best of quality. Had to cut wire that was sticking up. The first one I ordered wasn't packaged right & came out of open envelope. They were kind enough to send me another one,which I am very grateful. I will do business Wight them again.",1
4,Great custom Ray Bans!!! Needed a slight alignment to fit face.,1
5,"Perfect price, size and quality for our Disney trip.",1
5,I recommend sizing up one or two sizes if you want a true oversized for for leggings. I got my regular size and it fits very nice slightly baggy but not longer or bigger than I expected.,1
5,"Love the design on the fabric, the fit and flexibility of the skort and just realized that it has a cellphone  pocket on the shorts side. Yeah!",1
5,These were perfect for my Tragus piercings. I order two so I can have matching jewelry for both ears and the price was still very much so worth it. Getting one set of these locally in stores cost the same as getting two sets of these so I definitely saved a ton of money. They are regular sized and code with metal and plastic backings so you can choose what you prefer. Super cute designs!,1
5,Fits as expected. Made in USA. Can’t ask for more! For reference; I’m a 26” waist but wear 27” pants due to having a booty and thick thighs. I got this in a medium and it fits perfectly.,1
3,Shirt fit like a 2xl to 3xl but the skirt runs very small barely fit my size 4 daughter. With all the accessories it was still a good buy,0
1,"These are poorly made and first time it was worn, came apart. Not worth the price. I still have the black one, but the brown one came apart and was unable to wear again.",0
5,"I have this track suit in different colors. I love the comfort, feel and stretch of the material",1
5,This dress is even better than described. I was very pleasantly surprised.  It fit exactly like the chart said it would and I have received many compliments when I’m out and about!,1
1,The packaging consisted of a flimsy plastic container and that’s it. Looks like something heavy may have been laying on them in transit.  The lenses were fine but the frames were bent which made adjusting them very difficult. The side adjustments didn’t work at all because the little roller to stop the arms from moving was stripped out already. I am just trashing them. Not worth the trouble to send them back.,0
5,My 9 year old daughter loves this jacket. She was so excited to get it.,1
5,"Love this. Perfect for what I needed. Looks better on, than in packaging",1
2,runs large order size down,0
3,"It's so cute and flattering, but the zipper broke after 3 wears. I like the dress so much I'm having the zipper replaced, but won't buy it again.",0
2,My gf told me to order a small bc her large was getting lose. The<br />Mediums have no give. I’m so confused. I missed the rerun window!,0
4,"Nice band. Only complaint I would have with it on the edges of the band, a little scratchy but that will probably go away with normal wear. Lugs and hardware are nice and solid.",1
2,"You get what you paid for. They are horrible, they hurt my eyes.",0
2,I ended up returning this jumpsuit it just didn't fit well overall and I also didn't know it wasnt a full pant. The pant stops just above the ankle.,0
1,"These are made for the largest male face and that seems to be it. I pulled the mask all the way tight and it still fell off my nose. The mask is so large that the part which is supposed to be on my chin is up against my neck instead. It is very uncomfortable and useless. Masks need to fit properly to actually work, this is doing nothing. The straps around the ears are very cheaply sewed material and will fall apart quickly. Also, very uncomfortable as well. Sorry, but there is nothing positive to say about these.",0
2,Shirt fits good but the shorts are way to big,0
1,Way too big for. A newborn and looks funny in pictures .. wish I could return,0
2,"The colors were nice, but the shirt was too small.  We didn't like the square buttons either.  It gave it a bit of a feminine appearance.",0
4,"If you have an interview, a nice blazer over a skirt or pants with a nice blouse always works. This is a nicely made blazer and can also be worn with jeans. You can do so much with a nice blazer and it should be a wardrobe staple. The material is a more casual fabric but it still looks good.",1
5,"Love Love these leggings, perfect fit, color and size. Hoping to get all the colors. Very affordable too!!  Thanks Amazon just once again ~",1
2,It smashed my boobs flat and pulled the away from each other. Whatever escaped the booby trap squished out like a doughy muffin top... I was worried it was going to be too loose ... Needless to say I was worrying about the wrong thing.,0
3,"I liked that it tuned to a bag, but too pricey and when I washed it it got a lot of lint balls, I thought it would have been better quality for such a pricey sweater",0
2,It’s Beautiful But It Changed Color Quicker Than Shipping,0
5,Beautiful and strong. Post length just right. 7 mm was the size I needed for day to day and professional nursing wear. Will order larger ones for dressing up. Very comfortable. Excellent value.,1
3,No for me,0
3,The sandle had a neat look but it was a not as soft as it looked. The size was a bit big. We are returning at no cost.,0
4,Not bad for the price.,1
3,They are super cute but a little too small.,0
3,"This was at the TOP of my Christmas list, and I was THRILLED when I opened to find I had received these. They are so soft and adorable. The down size is they are TOO BIG. They do not stay up as shown in the picture.",0
1,These are not polarized as advertised,0
2,"I wear a size 12 pants and, following recommendations, ordered an XL. Friends, these pants were a size 6. If I took them apart and sewed both legs into one leg they would fit the way they are supposed to. As it was I couldn't even put them on.<br />Really sucks because I needed them for an event.<br />Photo is of pants next to a pair of size medium cropped leggings. The leggings stretch. The pants do not.",0
4,"I ordered the 41&#34; version (oddly, the order invoice listed it as 40&#34; for some reason even though I selected 41&#34;). So far, I really like this belt. Good looking and seemingly made with quality materials. The buckle is metal, so has some weight, but not too heavy for me. (Weighed in around 80g, with the entire belt at 140g.) I have a 33&#34; waist and use the belt to hold up 34&#34; jeans and shorts. When around my waist and tightened, I get between 3&#34; and 3 1/2&#34; of hangover between buckle and belt tip. This is quite a bit shorter than my other belts that usually have enough hangover to reach the loops on my jeans or shorts. In most cases, it just reaches the first loop, but in some it can't quite get that far. I'm OK with this as I had too much hangover on my other belts, but if you have a larger waist than 33&#34;, I'd highly recommend looking at a larger size than 41&#34; (not sure why they call it 41&#34;, actually, unless they are measuring the total belt without accounting for looping and stitching).<br /><br />It holds tight and in place without slipping, whereas other belts I've owned got lose and had to be retightened throughout the day. In the beginning, I felt that looping the tip around the fastener was a little slow and took some managing, but once I got it down, the process of putting on and taking off was pretty simple. Just had to get a routine and method in place.",1
5,I am into 40s and 50s fashion. I purchased this dress to wear to church.  The directions say dry clean but I washed on hand wash in the machine but will be taking it to the cleaners for a professional pressing. The material is thicker than I thought it would be. The cut emphasizes my waist and somewhat camouflages my hips (a good thing). I am 5'8&#34; 185 and this dress hits at mid-knee. I LOVE the bow tie. This dress screams for some peep-toe nude heels!,1
5,"well, it worked for a six hour convention. my feet never got sore once. straps were a bit confusing to figure out but once it got it it was perfect. i recommend sizing down by one, i got a 9 i believe, as that is my regular shoe size, and it was slightly too big. though the straps will do you some good. recommend these!",1
3,"Anklet is not adjustable it is a 10 inch anklet only. The anklet seems sturdy, But hangs all the way down to the bottom of ankle. I would have like for it to be adjustable it would give me a better fit.",0
1,This dress is so thin that you could see through your skin and underwear . I used it as a night gown,0
5,Good buy,1
1,way too small for adult male and I don't have large arms<br />actually damaged my arm putting it on and off,0
3,This is a cute swimsuit cover up but after washing one time is shrunk and is very disappointing,0
5,Much better quality than expected! Came with a nice case. They are larger than I thought but I have a large head anyway so it worked out for me.,1
3,"I ordered 2 sizes larger, it fit. The material is a bit stiff and thicker than I thought. It is ok...",0
1,Too small,0
5,It makes the mask so much easier to breathe in. It really helps at work!,1
2,"Tried them on and immediately hated them. the fabric feels so cheap and there is little to no mobility. i am 5,4 with short legs and they came barley below mid calf. overall just not a great buy.",0
4,good...^.^...,1
1,Sending back,0
5,Great pjs! Run a bit large,1
1,I do not know if it was just a dead battery or faulty mechanism. Battery is rated for 3 yrs so how long was this watch setting around or was it just a poor quality battery to begin with?<br />Watch was impressive looking and solid. It is much heavier than most watches. So I was disappointed to return it. I purchased a different brand watch instead.,0
4,Loved except sleeves slightly snug,1
3,"these would be useful for many, but the magnification strength just wasn't what I needed; I returned them",0
4,This dress was so inexpensive but nicely made! The dress was a perfect fit but the jacket was too tight so I had to send it back!,1
2,Poor quality !!,0
5,"My granddaughter never got to wear them, order wrong size. she did love them, so I reorder the correct size",1
2,"Not a bad belt, but the biggest problem is the leather loop. It is one color (brown) and doesn't really look good when you reverse the belt. That is if you can find it. The loop is not attached to the belt so as soon as you hang it up, it'll just slide off and become a play toy for your animals. I've already had to rescue mine twice. The reversible part actually looks nicer if you un-clamp the leather belt from the buckle and then clamp it on with the other side showing rather than using the part of the buckle that rotates.",0
5,Fast shipping and high quality materials.  Jacket is roomy perfect fit.  Keeps you nice and warm and allows your skin to breath so you don’t sweat!,1
1,Polyester material and material fuzzed up in a week.,0
3,"These are super cute and I love(d) all the options. However, I found the posts are too short and the backings don't stay on (the backings don't ""click"" - they just stay loose). I wore these on vacation and it was such a hassle: the backing kept falling off. By the end, a couple of ""diamonds"" had come out of one of the settings. Obviously you get what you pay for. I don't recommend wasting the money. Perhaps if you purchase and use the clear stopper backings instead of the backing that are provided, you might have more luck.",0
5,This cover up is super cute!  Looking forward to wearing it for my upcoming beach trip.  Fabric is soft and the drawstrings allow you to cinch it up a little on both sides.  Roomy and lightweight.,1
3,The shirt is coming apart and its itchy because the plastic wires are sticking out everywhere on the shirt. I received a lot of compliments on it but it's not worth the discomfort,0
5,Very nice,1
3,Love the band and it looks great but one of the buttons on the right side popped off a couple of days after he put it on.,0
5,Perfect!,1
5,Shipping was great...Wife loves it matches her watch.....Nice quality....,1
5,"I am 5,1 and 175lbs I have never had a dress look and fit so beautiful! I didn't even need it hemmed. So happy!!!!",1
5,Love this shirt!  I have purchased a few in different colors.  Although I have found different colors are made with different fabrics.,1
3,"It would be wonderful if it fit 18s comfortably but unfortunately they are quite snug for an average 16. Not horrible,stretchy material but,very ""fitting"".",0
1,Too small to wear,0
1,These pants are SO long! If you have a long legged baby these are for you! They did not work at all for our baby whose height is in the 50th percentile.,0
4,"I usually wear a size medium shirt and U.S. size 8 pants. I am 5' 8&#34; tall. I went by size recommendations of others and ordered a 2 XL. This fits me very well and I love the shorts. The front of the suit is lined but the back is not. ****Editing Review after wearing swimming. I still love this suit but the breast cups are really designed for small chested women. They are about the size of breast feeding nursing pads, so they sit on top of your breast like pasties. If there was a way I could remove them without cutting the lining I would.",1
5,For the price you can’t beat this adorable holiday dress. It was comfortable and perfect for Halloween. I had multiple compliments on this dress.,1
3,"I purchased a medium (which is my usual size). It does 'fit' but it is more form fitting. It's not as flowy as the shirt pictured. A little tighter around the neck. I think if I wanted the look in the picture I would order a large, possibly an extra large.  I do love the coloring of the tie dye.",0
5,"I bought this as a gift, and my husband loved it!  He's a Dr. Who and Calvin and Hobbes fan.  This was perfect!  He wears a large, so that's what I ordered.  It fit well.  It's been washed a few times (line dried), and it still looks and fits like new.",1
4,"Super cute,  would much rather get this than the Disney store costume.",1
5,"Beautiful bag, on the heavy side,Nice material and workmanship",1
1,Going back and reading the description I should have understood how big they were.  The photo was misleading but the description appears to have been accurate.<br /><br />Vey costume like in appearance and feel.  Won't be purchasing them again for sure.,0
5,These are absolutely perfect for the gym. Don't expect to wear these out for hours they aren't too comfortable but if you use them just for the gym or to shower then they couldnt be any better! They dry almost completely by the time I have to pack them back in my gym bag. 10/10 would recommend.,1
3,"It’s a really good product, not what I expected but it works, fabric it’s super really thin and not to expandable it feels a little to tight but it works",0
3,"Didn’t realize it’s see through, doesn’t come with a camisole or anything.",0
1,The XL for more like a M and the stitching around the neck was both loose in areas and scrambled in other areas. Plus the graphic wasn’t clear. My friends couldn’t even tell it was Dolly! I emailed the company and they quickly gave me a refunded and apologized for the bad experience. Wish it would have worked out.,0
5,My granddaughter love made for the young,1
5,Worked perfectly on my Tory Burch rubber rain boots!,1
3,"The dress was cute and the buttons added to the fact that it was a solid color. Unfortunately, the large fit more like a medium and the midsection bunches up and opened by each button.",0
1,When I received this item there was a huge rip in the main compartment.,0
5,"I love it, Excellent Quality",1
5,"Great price, nice normal length, decent quality.",1
5,Nice,1
2,"Giving a 2 star because when I received the dress it was torn on the side,other than that it's a beautiful dress",0
5,"Love these bike shorts.  Fit perfectly, don't run up.  Material quality is good and you can't beat the price for a 3 pack!",1
3,Great quality! But...does NOT fit an almost 5 year old face! Waaay too big! And she’s of average height and build.,0
3,Its good enough for a low cost item.,0
5,"It's the greatest, never take it off!",1
5,Good product. As expected. Perfect fit.,1
5,"Just what I was looking for, great transaction, fast shipping",1
1,"There was no style, shape, or quality! What a waist of  postage to mail. Ulk.",0
1,These shoes tore up the first time my kids wore them in the pool. I bought two pair and returned both pair after their first use.,0
5,"Have tried on and it fits.<br />Hope it holds up to chlorine water.<br /><br />Have been wearing in my aqua aerobics class and it has not stretched, changed color like my speedo swimsuit did.  Would",1
4,I ordered XL & I'm a medium...,1
3,Quality only acceptable.,0
2,I got a lil bit too much fat to rock this fit!,0
3,"I am 5’8”, 130lb, and wear a 34B. I purchased a small and the length is perfect. However, the dress on the model shows the top extending to about the waist.  The top portion of my dress only reaches is very short and the skirt begins a couple 2-3” above my waist. It’s comfortable for around the house but I won’t be wearing it out anywhere.",0
3,I have a hard time keeping by boobs from popping out the top. I ordered a size bigger because I had originally ordered the correct sized and it was small. Needed to by double sided skin tape to keep from falling out.,0
5,Gift for Christmas.,1
5,Cute dress,1
1,Too small and the back is not secure at all,0
5,Too much fun! Your Minion won't want to take them off. Perfect compliment to your wee one's costume.,1
5,They provide comfort and support without slipping.,1
3,"Really pretty watch, but I needed to size it down and the tool that came with it, didn't work very well.  I will have to take it to a jeweler to get it sized.",0
5,"I bought these shoes for my little girl. The sizes are a bit off, I ordered a pair in her regular size and they were to big, so I returned for a replacement pair with no problems. On the replacement pair, I did measure her foot and order a size I thought would be a little bigger on her foot, however they are a perfect fit. So I would go a little bigger then the size recommended on the measurements.  But love the shoes.",1
3,Son felt the surprise giftwastoo &#34;girly&#34;.,0
5,Looked very cool. Not too difficult to put together and the kids loved it.  The right arm with the squats moves and he says two phrases.,1
5,Very comfortable t shirt,1
4,"Runs small, so it ended up being a tight fit. It’s really wrinkle prone, but the design is nice and I got a lot of compliments on it. Only the two pockets but a good buy for the price.",1
1,this garbage screaming &#34;made in china&#34; !! Damn..,0
1,"It looked so amazing online, but when I received it the picture was blurry. It's hard to recognize who is in the picture and even buying one size bigger it is still super small.",0
5,"Fit well, looks great and comfy!",1
3,small and hard to see what they are.. yellow dogs would show up better.  This will be part of a raffle prize - I was hoping they'd be a bit more visible or show better what they are.,0
1,"Do not order! Ordered for my daughter's birthday dress, followed the size chart the company provided and ordered a size 2. Got the dress today and tried it on. Labeled size 2, but measuring 24&#34; in the chest on the dress! That's size 4 measurements! Fell right off my daughter. Returning for a refund. Back to the drawing board for a birthday dress.",0
4,Looks great but it's hard to keep the jewel dude facing out,1
5,I love these . They keep the hair out of my face,1
5,Great dress to wear to a winter wedding. Pleased with the quality for the price.,1
5,"Very tall (knee high, I'm 5'4), super thick, and very comfortable. I bought these to use during cold winter months, keeps me toasty from knee down!",1
4,A little see thru I wear a medium/large and the large fit great,1
5,"Love the material,  fit and quality.",1
5,Great wrap! Larger size is more comfortable especially sitting down. Very comfortable material. Good quality!,1
5,Good wallet with good price,1
4,"Not a soft, sexy material",1
3,Cute but not true to size,0
2,Usually love Soda brand shoes but these were def not up to par. The seller is great it's just the product... They run a half size too big and most definitely slippery on the bottom. Very cheaply made.,0
1,"Way too small, definitely not sized correctly",0
5,"This sunglass fits my head perfectly.  It is a little wider than most frames, and the arms on the frame are flexible.  This frame is wide enough for a more rounded facial feature head.  Plus, the cost of this sunglass is cheap.  I would highly recommend.",1
5,"These socks are the best ever! They’re perfect for every outdoor activity. They fit comfortably and allow your feet to breathe. I wear them hiking, camping, cycling, and to work. If you haven’t tried these socks, you need to as the quality can’t be beat!",1
5,Good,1
1,one size fits all meant for a pre-teen.  too small for an adult,0
3,Nice fabric and style,0
2,"The zippers suck, the strap ripped, the quality is not good. The size is good but thats about it.",0
5,Fits perfect material is good for sweat absorption. No complaints very satisfied,1
3,"Not sure how to rate, I really liked the style of the blouse.<br />The blouse is beautiful, can be dressy or dress down depending on the occasion).  I'm normally a Med/Large depending on cut, I ordered an Extra Large and it was too small across the bust.",0
5,"Gorgous chain ,looks expensiveI luv it, two thumbs up!!!",1
5,I ordered this set  for Father's day at my church. Not too expensive set that does the work. Thanks,1
5,"Perfect fit, padded bra, high impact appreciate",1
5,Looks exactly like pics . I bought Xlarge . I think it runs a bit small . Has some stretch . The cut in shoulders are very slimming and overall it's a really cute dress. The fabric is light but not see thru in black . Looking forward to wearing it this Summer . I don't wear shorts and this dress is stylish enough to wear out or just as a casual nice look. It's very stylish and not frumpy !!,1
3,"I was torn between keeping or returning this dress. I'm 5'4 165lbs and normally wear a large. But after reading reviews, I ordered a size up. The XL was a slight bit big on me I felt, but think if I went down to the large it might have been too snug. I chose to return it, I've been losing weight so it would only have gotten bigger on me, but the main reason for returning it was the length of the short side of the dress over the knee. It doesn't look too far above the knee in the picture, and I figured that since the model in the picture was most likely taller than I am, that it would maybe even be a bit longer than the picture. Nope! It was a good inch or two shorter on me. Not appropriate for the office, I probably wouldn't even wear it to a wedding. And the picture shows what looks to be modest cleavage but on me it was almost up to my collar bone. Not flattering. Overall, maybe on a different body type it might look okay, but I couldn't think of a single event that I could wear it to, so it had to go back.",0
5,"If you prefer your workout tops to be loose, definitely size up. I purchased an XL and it was ok (I usually wear large). The fabric is very soft and smooth. Nice workout top",1
1,Cheap doesnt function like the reg 700s. No auto light i guess the 2 tone band is supposed to make up for that. I love g shock have 6 of them. But this version. Blows its almoat like a knockoff. It has no outstanding features. Hated it. Sent it back. I love my GWG1000 1af MudMaster and my frogman. Don't waste ur money. Save uo and buy the Mudmaster.,0
5,Purchased 3 aprons and hats for my grandkids. It’s perfect! Perfect for Christmas gifts!,1
5,"Love this top. I bought it in several different colors. So cute and comfy. Not too thick of material, but make sure you get your size, so it is not unflattering.",1
3,"I bought this to replace a leather necklace I already owned that was frayed and very old.  This is harder to use than the old one - the lobster clasp is very small, and difficult to put on by myself.",0
2,Nice flattering cut but the quality of the material is not worth the price. Wouldn't pay more than $8 for this,0
5,SO CUTE,1
1,I ordered a size 3X these pants are so small my eight-year-old grandson couldn’t fit in them he is skinny these pants were only eight dollars but there wasn’t even eight dollars worth of fabric used to make them please somebody check what’s being sold Amazon‘s name is on this,0
5,I love it! After first washing and drying it’s still very cozy and looks awesome,1
3,It’s nothing like the picture. It’s not exactly off the shoulder.,0
5,Zero complaints from me buddy. They look great and fit perfectly.,1
1,Does nothing for fuller figure absolutely zero shape when on and the material itched a lot<br />Sent it back,0
1,"My father can not wear them, they are too short.",0
4,Smaller than expected!,1
1,It came a month late and I received it broken. I’m very sad because it was supposed to be a gift for one of my friends for her birthday!!!,0
5,Its Great!,1
5,"Awesome hat! Finally something to keep the pesky gnats out of my face when I’m gardening or doing yard work. It’s so well made. I love that the netting is built in and not an add on. It zips back up in the top of the hat when you don’t need it. It also came with some great extras of socks and a cool bandana. Really great value for the hat all by itself, add the bonus gifts and wow! 5 star experience!",1
2,It did not fit me well. Uncomfortable,0
5,Thank you so much. It came in less than a week it's perfect.  Thank again.,1
5,"Super cute, perfect fit, love this tank!",1

5,works,1
3,"Love this necklace, very beautiful but it gets tangled very easily which makes me not enjoy wearing it...",0
4,this is good for a pit bull dog :p,1
5,"Love this pendant. Very well made, beautiful.  Wearing every day as it reminds me to pray for all of my energy to be balanced. Thank you Amazon for carrying this nice piece.",1
5,"Very pleased with this mask. It's large enough, double-ply, has a place for a filter, and is just gorgeous. So many of the sequin masks are not shaped correctly or quite big enough, (and I have a small face) but these are shaped to fit, and the rhinestones are secure and really sparkle. I needed an orange one to match my orange outfits. :-)<br />Very happy and would recommend to all.",1
1,"even for the price, the item is pretty bad.  I bought two of these belts, and both of them have lost the eyelets in any belt-hole i use after a matter of a few days.<br /><br />if you're going to wear them lose and only once in a while, i'm sure they're fine, but this is not a day-in-day-out belt.",0
5,Used once.  Worked great,1
5,Very good,1
5,Nice fabric.,1
3,"In the picture the colors look very bright, but it is actually very pale, It’s rainbow but the color are not as vibrant as the picture.",0
5,"Perfect, just what I needed",1
1,"El producto no me duro ni 4 días, tomaron un color oxidado el precio por este producto es inadecuado me siento estafada al haberlo adquirido. Le daria 0 estrellas porque es un item sin calidad alguna.",0
5,Great fit,1
5,"beautiful but runs a little small, im usually a medium but ordered a large fits great",1
3,"Cute set, but clearly looks fake. Cute set for the cost.",0
3,"I thought it would be like long underwear waffle, but it was some kind of cheaper material",0
3,The dress is not true to size.,0
4,"I really, really like this hat! It is gorgeous and classy! My one complaint about it is that it never bounced back from being folded when shipped! It still looks great, but it seems the folds in the hat are permanent.",1
1,Easy to rip,0
1,Super cute glasses but I will not be able to wear these . The inside of the glasses cut my nose you can feel sharp glass cutting down on your nose .,0
5,I loved it!!! One of of my best purchase ever!!!,1
5,"I really like this. It’s comfortable, light and stretchy. I did go up a size.",1
1,I ordered this item. For the 3 pc tie bar clips and it told me I would get a free tie holder. All I received was the tie holder (which I do not need) and no clips. I am very disappointed.,0
1,the pants i got are literally a different pair of pants then in the pic. when i got them they were like weird silk pajamas pretty much. they had no fly but had a belt loop and they a were really weird lengths. definently would not recommend these pants. they looked like something some dude would put on when he got home from the bar and was super drunk and didn't care what the butt his pants looked like. like their literally silk and nerdy and look like a buttcheelk,0
3,Love the material but sizes run on the small size,0
4,decent belt for travel a little stiff but no need to remove to go through security,1
5,I have received many compliments on this striking necklace!,1
5,"Super cute, good material n fits well",1
3,Cute and fits well but the green is way lighter than shown.  Its more moss colored then Forrest green.,0
4,Nice size bag with many compartments. Easy to carry. Looks nice. It will NOT however hold an IPad which is what I was hoping.  A smaller notepad maybe.,1
3,"It's a very nice outfit but the tag says XXL and fits like a medium, i'm actually trying to sell it. It's very small fitting.",0
5,Bought these for my post lasik sunglasses. They are super cute and sturdy and help shield my eyes from the sun.,1
2,Cheap quality,0
5,"Sunglasses were a gift so I'm not sure about how they hold up. But I did open the box and check them out before gifting, they seemed of pretty good quality.",1
3,Absolutely love the color and material of this skirt.  BUT... there is this thin piece of elastic at the very top of the waist band that makes it uncomfortable.  The rest of the skirt fits great so I don't really want the next size up.,0
2,"Nice frames, comfortable, wouldn't buy again unless I needed them for a costume piece.<br /><br />I used a blue light filter test and these didn't perform well. Additionally, under medium bright sunlight, they didn't transition much.",0
5,Love these little earrings.  I wear them almost every day and they are bright and shiny.  They are uncomfortable to sleep in (which I like to do usually) but it's a small price to pay to take them on and off every night for great every day earrings!,1
5,"Lovely gown, so cozy, just right for cold winter nights.  Love it!!",1
5,"I love the gold snake finger ring,only thing that i did'nt like that it started to fade a week later.",1
1,"lens delaminated almost immediately. I still use them, but will replace sooner than expected.",0
5,This is a gift. Anything with Bias on it is a plus. GO TERPS!🐢,1
5,LOVE them. Just go ahead and buy them lol will be ordering more colors soon!,1
5,Love it!  Just like the picture!  I put it on my small navy crossover bag and it looks beautiful!,1
5,Adorable dress!  Used it for a photoshoot.  I look forward to wearing it again in the future!  :),1
3,It states that it is waterproof but I have worn it twice in the rain on hikes and have gotten wet anyways. They shouldn't advertise something if the product doesn't actually do it. The only thing I like about it is that it's comfortable and fits well.,0
3,I like it but it fits my waist but not my thighs (almost).,0
4,Nice pleased,1
2,The leather band is nice and seems to be okay quality. However the metal connectors slip right off my watch no matter how hard I try to connect them. This makes the band unusable unless you put different metal connectors on.,0
2,"Didn't quite fit right. Too tight on the nose, and if you slide it up then the shades ate too high.<br /><br />Also started falling apart 2 months later, brittle.",0
2,Cheap looking,0
4,"Its o.k. but wish there were two, left and right.",1
5,Very nice!,1
3,Product is thin and looks like cheap lens.,0
3,A little feminine looking but that's offset by the large dial face.Watchband hard to use. Overall a good buy.,0
5,Product delivered on time and as advertised.,1
1,Would have been great but it fell over my face or off the back of my head.,0
2,"Cheap quality heel replacement material. Had to replace after one day use. Stop using, collecting dust.",0
1,"SO upset. I love this watch, and it claims to be waterproof, but I've been wearing it less than 3 weeks, and its completely tarnished. I took it off to clean my green wrist today, arbs the clasp feel straight off. So so sad.",0
5,"Shoes were prettier in person, pictures does them no justice!",1
4,"I purchased this headband with the intention of placing it upon my brow and then being able to smite my foes and evildoers everywhere, but I think I may be using it wrong.  The first night I had it, I had a little ceremony at my shrine.  Its not so much a shrine as a desk with a statue of one of those cats whose paw goes up and down, some plastic flowers, and unlit incense.  I used to light the incense but the smoke really agitates my mom's IBS or COPD or something.  But anyway, after my ceremony I donned the sacred headband and headed to the local truck-stop to find some ne'er-do-wells.  That is when I discovered the lack of powers.  Rather than ""Sweep the leg, Johnny!"" and great cheering all I heard was a resounding chorus of profanity and an intense feeling of both pain and shame as the truckers violated me with what I believe to be a prophylactic filled with meth which was then swiftly removed and used to club me about the head and neck.  I only managed to escape by telling them I heard the Feds were on their way disguised as bikers.  As luck would have it, a huge biker gang pulled up at that moment and the truckers, believing the bikers to be Feds, attacked them.  I huge, tattooed, rumble erupted like a Jack Daniels and Fentanyl fueled scene out of an alternate universe West Side Story.  Anyway, I am home now and will check to see if perhaps the headband requires batteries or a different ceremony of some kind.  Tomorrow I shall descend upon the docks in search of dishonest Longshoremen .",1
2,The bracelet broke into pieces. I didn’t understand why. One piece after another just popped off.,0
5,"This product was exactly as advertised. I was worried that they wouldn't fit over my shoes, but they ended up being perfect. They keep your feet dry and protected while biking in poor weather while still allowing you to grip the pedals. These are a good solution for anyone who has to ride in cold or wet conditions.",1
1,Too big..cheap looking...looks like a pair of 3d cinema glasses,0
5,"Love it, thought it would be a little longer but its still amazing",1
3,I find it helpful but the metal that was used is really flimsy. It bends easy I have to be careful not to break it.,0
3,"some of the pairs did not stretch enough to get my foot inside. Some of there pairs had excessive yarn/string material inside, cause it to get stuck between toes when inserting my foot.",0
5,"[[VIDEOID:29d7e2681a80da30499c61401db942aa]] I’ve bought all types of compression socks to help with my varicose veins. Unfortunately they are either difficult to put on or too loose. These were perfect, easy to put on while delivering the right amount of compression on my legs. Plus you can’t beat that price!",1
5,Love it,1
2,"Very cute, but run small. The belt also was smaller than the waist.",0
4,I love this and how cute it is. It’s so soft and fluffy. The only thing i hate about it is the buttons. It’s not easy to button when you’r baby is a mover,1
5,"I’m 6’0 and typically a size 8 and I believe I ordered a large! This is so supportive, I’m larger chested and it supports the girls perfectly. Ordering another!",1
5,"awesome shirt, great over sized fit, a staple favorite",1
1,"Disappointed it is a short, tight, see through top.  Cheap material.",0
3,"It does what it is supposed to do but my gosh it digs into your arms at the top right in between your shoulder and arm put. That very sensitive skin area! It hurts! I doubt I'll be wearing this too much. Taking it off was a hassle also. At one point, I thought I would just need to cut it of me! Other than that, it fits well, and encases you like a sausage!",0
5,Works surprisingly well!,1
1,Too big and gave me this weird pooch prego look in the belly.,0
5,I like it especially its design,1
5,"Drove from IL to Texas for a HS graduation being held there, daughte immediately loved it. Hoping she'll decide to move there. She's tall 5'7"", 115 lbs, size XS or S but has long arms. Needs size M for long sleeve.",1
5,Great fit and great style.  These are saving me at my home office now.,1
1,I usually wear a lrg to xlrg... Depending on how I want to wear the shirts. I ordered a xlarge and it's way too small firs more like a medium.<br />So be sure to.order a size or two up.<br />Like to return but says I hafta return to Ups... Ummm closet ups drop-off is almost 40 minutes away... So I guess I'll give this shirt to sum1 smaller then me..<br />Lost money on this one...,0
5,Big and clunky lots of fun to wear.,1
3,"Runs small, but nice material",0
5,Very nice glasses,1
5,It was a gift. It arrived earlier than thought which was great. And the recipient loved it!,1
3,Just got this it’s very nice but it came with missing links I’m gonna send back,0
3,"After 3 hours, it turned my daughter's finger green.<br /><br />It's very pretty otherwise, but upsetting.",0
5,"I expected it to be fitted, but still was slightly smaller than I expected. Overall, though, I really like it. The material feels great. I see this becoming a new fav. Good quality.",1
1,I had to return because they were too big for kids.,0
2,"As with the other reviews that ordered this in &#34;pink, the sleeves are not pink at all. They are white but look exactly how whites look when you throw a red sock in the wash. It's just off. Not nearly as cute as the picture.",0
1,The material was too thin and the thighs were pretty snug. Waist fit well.,0
5,It’s great!!!,1
3,"These pants were OK. No back pockets and the front pockets were actually on the side, not in the front. I would not consider these low rise. They were mid rise, and the front was a bit higher than the back. Not fond of that. However, the color was nice (I ordered a blue) and they were very soft. The fit was good also.  I returned them because of the rise, but might have kept them otherwise.",0
4,It could have been a tiny little longer but I love everything else about it. Simply elegant!,1
4,"I love the fit on this dress!! As a 5’ 1” person, the length on this dress was perfect. I’m 110lbs and got the small the size was great. The material is light, for me it got a little static-y but not too bad- and you can get away without a slip",1
5,"It’s very comfortable, stretch, and enough thickness. Oh and oooh sooo sparkly!! I love it!!",1
5,"I ordered these for my daughter after reading the reviews. And we were pleasantly surprised! It arrived in two days, which was right in time for a gathering she wanted to attend. It looks great and no once can tell that it's not made of metal.",1
5,"I bought these for my three year old, and they're perfect. They are not too overwhelming for a toddler's head, but large enough to be noticed.",1
2,"These socks are comfortable and wick well, but they do not last very long before getting holes in the toes. Other less expensive socks perform similarly with better durability.",0
5,my daughter loved it!!,1
1,"Initially had wrote that this product did exactly what it should do; keep accurate time.  After wearing for a few days, that is no longer the case; the hours and date change sporadically throughout the day.  This watch is by no means expensive but even so, not worth the price.",0
1,Extremely large!!!,0
1,Different parts of the necklace had different color stones. They were not consistent at all,0
5,Got it for my father who loved racing. He grew up a Bill Elliott fan so he dug this shirt.,1
3,Are usually always get extra large is to be safe. But even as an extra large this one is small there’s absolutely no stretch to it.,0
5,Super cute and comfortable.,1
1,Buyer beware I an tall and the ring passed my nuckle joint. Looks like it was painted with glitter nail polish,0
5,"This dress is amazingly beautiful. I bought a lot of dresses lately, liking most of them,but this one is perfection. So well constructed,great quality, good packaging and fantastic material. I bought burgundy in L. Fits perfect. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds, 36DDD with some wt in the middle section. You can't see any of this imperfections wearing this dress. It's so flattering. Simple and elegant.Looks luxurious.  RECCOMENED.<br />UPDATE. I bought 2 more dresses in 2 different colors. Navy fit great. Full satisfaction like the burgundy. The light blue/denim is beautiful, but I was disappointed because even same size L fit and fill like XL OR 1X. I decided to keep it and put a belt,but still inconsistency in sizing bother me.",1
5,"My primary reason for getting this watch was because I have a newborn baby and I've realized it's really useful to have the time ready available, my cell phone wasn't going to cut it. I usually don't wear watches because I'm not a fan of analog and all the digital watches I've seen are very sporty looking. I wanted a digital women's watch that looked casual. I owned one once before from Tommy Hilfiger and it was complete crap. Never worked even after replacing the battery on it twice so I assumed I was out of luck until I saw this one. Gotta say I love the watch...I had the same issue as others mentioned where the watch was 15 mins delayed but after letting the radio signal do its thing, it updated in 24 hours. I left it face down next to a window at night per instructions. They mention night is the best time to update because there is less interference and since I'm up all night anyway these days I did a couple of manual tries and I got it. The watch is very sturdy a little thick but not bad at all compared to sports watches. Really happy with this one",1
5,I am 5'1'' 180 lbs I ordered a size large in the black cat Christmas dress. It fit great the V neck part was just a little low for me but I used a safety pin. Everyone gave my compliments and thought it was so cute. The dress is very soft and it was not see through at all.,1
5,These Kevlar boot laces are durable and tough. These boot laces wear well and last a long time before needing to be replaces. These laces are a good value for the money.,1
5,Fits perfect.  Quality is great.,1
4,"I feel really torn about this review because I was so excited about this bag.<br />I bought this bag so it could be a purse diaper bag combo for myself. I wanted to simplify my life but being able to carry the things I need in one bag vs two+; I wanted a bag I could quickly put a set of clothes in and diapers for doctors appointments or incase of an emergency.<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br />·internal pockets- the two sections are spacious and nice. One side does seem to be bigger than the other but not by much. The bigger zipper in the middle is nice but thin and the other fits a lot of smaller stuff and would be a good place to put a phone or keys. The other open pockets are bigger but they aren't deep like you'd think.<br />·spacious - it is big enough that you can put a lot of stuff in it.<br />·well made and sturdy - you can tell its well made and will last a while.<br />·Crossbody - having the Cross body option makes it a double win because you can wear it different ways.<br />·customer service - before recieving the bag, I had an issue with delivery. The seller was in touch with me right away, gave me information about the product and overall, was very helpful and pleasant to work with.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br />·smell - I'm fairly sensitive to smells and this one had a smell that made me nauseous. However, it has subsided over time.<br />·heavy - the material itself it very heavy even without stuff in it. Add items esp clothes and you going to hurt your shoulder. I put my items in this and put it on my shoulder a few times as a test and my shoulder was sore for the rest of the day. So I think if your thinking of getting this for work or carrying a lot of items for long time, you might wanna consider that.<br />·uncomfortable straps - I really thought these would be more comfortable but they are not. Add the combo of the heavy canvas material and it makes it harder to carry. if they were comfortable it would make the bag more appealing for me. Even the cross body strap provided is not comfortable and too thick<br />·internal material - as other have stated before its going to be hard to find stuff easily. This is partly because the internal material is dark colored but also because it is very lose on the inside of the bag which is disappointing because of the quality as well as the price you pay for it. Just from putting things in the bag to use, I was constantly having to move the fabric out of the way to put things in or move stuff around which was frustrating.<br />·zipper - the closing zipper is awkward and mostly in the way. If it was completely from one end to the other it would work better or a magnet clasp would even be better. If I was going to use it, i would cut the zipper out as others have also mentioned doing themselves.<br />·returning - even though this bag was great in a lot of ways, I really needed to see this for myself and decided I wanted to return it for the reasons I listed above. Due to the location of the seller, retuening would mean that I would need to pay out of pocket to gice the item back as well as it would be much more than the bag itself. The sell does offer you a 20% refund (and you keep the bag), which turns into only $14.00. I do wish this was a little more because the bag I got (small one) is close to 50$. Again the seller is great to work with regardless.<br /><br />I decided to give this item 4 stars because it is very well made and a lot of the negatives I had were my own personal perferences.",1
5,Better than expected. Beautiful and fits wonderfully! The price can't be beaten and the shipping was super reasonable.,1
3,"I can't believe how long these are, they drag through the mud the water everything even with taller shoes on",0
1,Demasiado grande,0
2,They were beautiful. The gold ones were the right size but the purple were an extra large!! Disappointed with that.,0
5,Needed a new State shirt for my reunion. Fits great may buy another color if there is one.,1
4,"Great hue, looks more like a normal pair of glasses and less sunglasses",1
2,"Just didn't like, I returned it.",0
5,"I wear it for 2 months, so far it's worth every penny.",1
5,Fit well,1
5,"It is a very good product, it is used for my workouts and it works very well, it fits well to the body, it stretches and allows me to perform the exercises without problems.  to clarify practical boxing",1
4,"I purchased these because I had to take my steel nipple rings out for a medical procedure.  I would buy these again. This is a good product and reasonably priced.<br /><br />Good:<br />- The bars are comfortable.  Granted, I'm used to rigid steel, but these fit in like a breeze and I've not had any issues.<br />- Good length. I got 5/6&#34;, which is standard nipple ring length. The bars fit just right.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- The balls were hard to get off the bar. I had to use my teeth to unscrew them.<br />- The balls are smaller than average.  I will be changing the balls to larger ones that come with a different pair of rings.",1
5,Good fit!,1
4,"Received as described. Unfortunately, ( my neck size is an 19&#34; to 19 1/2 &#34; )  therefore, I needed to cut the tie in half and added more material in the middle so that it would fit my neck. Additionally, as a suggestion ... They should also include instructions as to how to properly tie a formal bow tie.",1
5,What’s not to love? In perfect condition with matching case.,1
5,Perfect for my 5yr old,1
5,It works very well for me. Worth it.,1
3,"The ears were very nice, I gave this product 3 stars because the packing was missing tail and bow. I didn’t need the bow but I did need the ears. I emailed the company but no reply still. If it wasn’t for the price I would return due to missing item and lack of communication",0
4,Great product but misleading I thought it was a multi pack.,1
1,"Personally, my body had a horrible reaction to this jewelry in specific. Not sure what it was about it, but i tried a few different rings in this set, and all made my nose very irritated and bleed constantly, and basically reversed the healing it had done. I switched to another brand of rings and cleaned/took care of the piercings and very soon after that it was like nothing ever happened.",0
5,Warm and well-made.,1
3,These are exactly what I expected to get. The quality is poor but I didn’t expect anything fabulous. They were played with for a weekend before they started to break. We used them as party favors.,0
4,"The material is soft and I’m guessing it’s wrinkle free, shirt length is just by the hip, arm length and fit is as expected. I just hope it’s not going to shrink cause It maybe tight if it does. So far I’m happy with the shirt.",1
3,"My wife got a sherpa from Victoria Secret and the material was insanely soft, so I wanted a sherpa for around the house. Most sherpas were priced around $30-$40 but this was only $9.59 in my size so of course I ordered it.<br />The material is nowhere near as soft as my wife's Victoria Secret sherpa. This one almost feels like wool, so it doesn't have that silky-smooth softness to it.<br />You can also see the material under the fur, similar to what you see in a super cheap floor rug. I've uploaded pictures so you can see what I'm talking about.<br />Unfortunately, mine came with a rip in the sleeve as well so I really question how long this will last. I am sending it back and getting a replacement from Amazon so hopefully the replacement is in better condition.",0
2,The size guidelines posted does not accurately reflect the actual size.,0
1,Not able to wear straps fall off shoulders way to big poor quality.,0
5,"Large enough Roll to cover at least 4 suitcases.  Easy to use and I think Ideal for bus travel where you don't want your suitcases scuffed or opened without you knowing about it.  While I bought to protect suitcases for a trip (air travel), I ended up not using as I wasn't sure if this could be a problem for bag or customs inspection though seems easy enough to put on and therefore take off.  Appreciate the comments that suggest if you take this with you to place on top in your carry on as the size and shape make this an inspection worthy item.",1
3,"I like it and I'll work with it, but I can't believe it's a 3x. The shoulders are really tight. I am going to attempt to alter it somehow.",0
5,these work great,1
5,These are sooooo soft & comfy. Small is perfect for a small 14 year old that wears a 2-4 in women's sizing.,1
4,"I have to say - for the price of these glasses -- are you kidding? They are GREAT - I bought 4 pairs after my 1st. Ok they are not the best quality - but for the price and look - the are fantastic. Ony suggestion for fit.. bend them slightly from both sides inward -- they are a bit straight across the face otherwise.  I live in Palm Beach, FL and I have received so many complements on the design by strangers,  I love them -- they are fun. Dont expect outrageous quality for the price -- but YES -- worth the few bucks -- ENJOY",1
5,This was a gift for someone the loved especially the two size due to they have a large wrist the bigger strap worked great and gave him extra room and the dual prones to lock it was the second best feature unlike the original apple band only have one prone.. overall great durable product especially for sports fans…,1
1,I dislike this product because i have ordered this twice due to the glasses being out of shape and my second one is now uneven once again! If youre gonna make sunglasses makes them even and in shape!,0
5,super cute,1
5,"This dress is amazing! The sizing was perfect, it's flattering, comfortable and has that little ommpf of sexiness without being revealing",1
5,Very clever and a great personalized gift for a coffee lover! Very nice quality and the presentation was amazing.,1
5,"Beautiful dress compared to price. Very comfortable. The dress could have been very classy with the coral colour roses on white,but the stripped sleeves makes it look casual, that way I an wear it anywhere without looking over dressed.",1
5,This shirt is very nice! I love the fit of the shirt and the design! Very cute! Will definitely order from this seller again!,1
1,Too small and smell really bad and have powder that comes off on hands.,0
2,If you’re busty definitely go up an extra size. The top elastic is very constrictive. It’s a nice dress but absolutely hate the material. It’s a scratchy poly blend. Not silky feeling like I had hoped. Will not be buying additional colors,0
5,Fits well and feels perfect for summer,1
4,"Nice, well made purse",1
5,"This is more beautiful than I expected. The quality is excellent. I will be buying more from this seller. Very fast shipping too! Also, it came in a lovely box if you want to give it as a gift.",1
2,The dress was more like a costume instead of a formal dress. The price should have been my clue. Very poor quality.,0
5,Love these! I got them because the sunglasses I had hurt around my ears. These have a soft rubber that flexes so it isn't hard around your ears. Very comfortable!,1
3,Not very durable. Fell apart after a year or so. Was heavily used during that time.,0
4,"It was, ckose fitting and not overly gasping  in the crutch.",1
5,Wonderful leather pants just in time for winter.,1
5,The perfect length for me. They fit nicely and seem a little stretchy. Love these so much I will get another pair. The waist fits perfectly.,1
3,Very pretty looks just like the picture.  This one got here faster than expected.  It's a perfect gift for a teen or young adult.,0
5,"Okay, admittedly when I got this dress, I put it away to gather dust awhile. Wasn’t sure if I liked it. It didn’t look like the picture. Looked like a duller, cheaper version in person. I pulled it out one day and tried it on. I liked it a little. No a whole lot, but enough to give it another chance. I was seriously thinking of returning it.<br /><br />After a few pounds lost, I tried it on again. Hubby was captivated, upset I was still on the fence. That was a few months ago. Let me tell you, I love, love love this cute. Sexy little halter dress. It’s one of my go-to’s for a casual date in the park with my husband or an outing just about everywhere (except church). I prefer more conservative wear for church. Very where else, it’s an understated show-stopper!",1
5,Got lost,1
1,Poor quality! Came with a broken strap. Cheap material.,0
4,"Awesome quality warm jacket...and I actually use it as two different jackets because the fleece lining comes out as it's own stand alone jacket. Very warm. Didn't give it 5 stars because the button clasps that hold the two jackets together at the sleeve cuffs immediately tore off the 2nd or 3rd time I wore the jacket. Not a neccessary function, it's just dissapointing when something brand new breaks. Seems durable besides that though.",1
3,"Cute little necklace.  Is longer than stated,  and also has an extender which was not stated.  Lays very nice.",0
5,"I wasn’t expecting this to look as nice as it did given the price. I thought it would look cheap and wouldn’t fit (as I am plus size and it’s always hard to find stuff that fit nicely). But this surprised me pleasantly, the quality was good and the material stretches so it fit me like a glove! Happy with the purchase!",1
3,I've had a few stones fall out. NOT well made. If the stones stay in then they're nice which is why I'm being nice about the 3* rating.,0
5,I came across this by accident. It matched my swimwear perfectly. Extremely happy.,1
1,"This is the 3rd bathingsuit I have purchased on Amazon, all happened to come from this company, They are being shipped from China, so they take weeks to get here, when it does finally arrive, the fit is horrible and very inconsistent between tops and bottoms (If the correct size comes at all), very cheaply made and the worst part is if they don't fit, don't bother sending it back because shipping it back to China costs more than the suit. Do yourself a favor, save the money and frustration and go to the store to buy a suit  you can try on.",0
2,Comfortable but small and squeaky.,0
5,"Love this suit, fits my 11 year old daughter nicely and covers where it needs to",1
2,I purchased 6 headbands but have only used one. The slide off my head. I bought them for hot yoga but really cannot use them.  I am very disappointed.,0
4,My 11 year old loves these sneakers!! He is excited to go back to school to show off his new sneakers! They fit well and seem to be well made.,1
2,"The material is lightweight and very thin, cheaply made in China, as with everything made in China (low quality).  It’s such a hassle to return it, and I can still use it to bring my yoga mat and knee pad, but not much else; hence, the two-star rating.",0
5,Thank you for my SinCity Family shirt,1
5,This anklet is gorgeous. I bought the snake chain and love it so much. The best part is I wear it 24/7 and it’s so sturdy and hard to break.,1
1,The color of the leopard print was different than what the online picture showed. I was disappointed and returned it.,0
1,I wish you could purchase top separate from bottoms! The top straps aren’t adjustable. Bottoms way too tight and top is way too big. I am a 36B and 14 bottoms. This didn’t work for me. Loved the swimsuit though!,0
2,Its not at all like the picture. It keeps me warm thats about it,0
1,I am incredibly unhappy with this product. I don’t understand why there are only five chains when there are 10 pendants each. I cannot finish my order now. I am not happy with this at all. Be aware that there is not enough chains for all pendants,0
2,The instructions are very basic - they reference tools and items that aren't available with the kit.  There is no description of the tools included and the battery tester has no information with it.<br /><br />The quality of the vise is pretty poor - the watches I had wouldn't fit in the vise.,0
3,"Can't complain for the price, bought them for spare driving glasses and they serve their purpose well on sunny days.",0
2,"I initially liked the bag a lot. The price was great and it looked pretty good. But after just 3.5 months of use, it started to fall apart. The inner lining ripped away from the canvas exterior and the zipper started getting completely stuck. Now the zipper doesnt actually zip at all. It runs along the track but leaves zipper threads totally open behind it. Definitely a lesson in &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Didn't expect a $30 bag to last a lifetime, but hoped it would hold up a little longer than it did.",0
5,the fit is nice for the up move. I have been wearing it to bed and have not had a problem with the up falling out.,1
1,Open the package and the silver is rusted and the leather is peeling! Like did the list to f say used? This is horrible! I will be refunding this asap,0
1,One of the seams wasn’t completely sewn.  Right out of the bag there was a gaping hole in one seam.  Otherwise the material seems good.,0
1,This came broken,0
1,"good looks, bad quality.  A stem came off before I could even get it set.  Have tried twice to send it back but get no response.",0
5,Bought as a gift.  She loved it!,1
4,Good for the price,1
5,This is so cute and much thicker than I thought it would be. I love the color,1
5,Ordered this dress for my daughter's high school graduation party.  It was so cute on her! Dress was well made and fit very well in her regular size.,1
3,"I was disappointed, for a product that is x-large, it sure is small.  I was expecting it to expand to a more round shape when filled.  It is totally flat! very little storage.  The product is made very well.  but to small.",0
5,"Loved this. Came very quickly, amazing quality, adorable packaging and I really appreciate all the time, effort & money that went into this product.",1
1,"I need a flashlight to find this in my, not too big, purse.  A waste of the room it takes up.  A great idea, not well designed for use.",0
5,"I ordered Spikerking’s Mens No Show Boat Socks Deodorant Cotton Socks Value 5 Pack Crew Socks and love them. I am a women, shoe size 8, and find that even though these are made for men, they fit me just fine! I love to wear these type of sock with flats, boat shoes, and vans. They are comfortable! They fit perfectly and do not stick out of my shoes, perfect no shoe socks. I look for these often and can find that they can be expensive. But this pack was a great value! It came with 5 pairs of socks all in a different color which is nice in case it does slightly show at any time.

5,Love these !!!,1
5,I loved it I love it,1
2,"Let me start by saying that these are very cute boots, but.. they are  extremely wide in the calf area. I am 5'5&#34; 125 lbs with wide calves and they are big on me. Perfect for someone who might tuck jeans etc.. in them.",0
5,"I paid $30 for a watch that's as beautiful as any $500 dollar watch!!!! Strongly recommended for anyone who likes automatic watches, you can't go wrong with this watch!!!!",1
2,Kept this ring only because I loved the design.  The plating was a mess leaving bits and pieces between that were jagged and snagged on clothes.  I broke the pieces off with some pliers and tried sanding them down. Bringing me to the second thing... this is plated over copper not brass.. I got the ring thinking it would wear to a more golden color. The plating is starting to wear off but the pink of the copper is showing through.,0
2,The plastic panel on the back (for operating your phone) starting coming unstitched right away.,0
1,Very small and one cuff was missing! Cheap quality! Very disappointed!,0
1,This watch is a piece of crap. It arrived broken and because it's &#34;under warranty&#34; I had to mail it to the manufacturers. I had to pay for postage AND pay for them to mail it back to me. Then it immediately broke again after one day of wear. I finally took it to a jeweler who fixed it properly. But DO NOT BUY IT!,0
3,nice style order a size up,0
4,"An attractive stone, but does it repel radiation?",1
5,"I had to purchase compression socks for nursing school. They had to be white, which believe it or not, it is difficult to find good white compression socks. I love these sock!. I've tried several brands of compression socks, and they've all been uncomfortable at the ankle and knee. Most of the pairs I've tried cut in at the band. These socks were comfortable all day and made a noticeable difference in swelling at the end of the day. I will be purchasing more in the future .I will say that I wear a women's 7.5 and I purchased the size small. I also have narrow feet. I would say that if your shoe size is larger than that, you would need to go up in size.",1
3,"I really wanted to like this top, but it's poorly executed. The white is very see-through, the length is too short, and the material feels like it will stretch out and get ruined very quickly. The lace and the rest of the top are made from very different materials and the lace is not stretchy.",0
5,Zipper gets stuck but can’t reach Amazon to return,1
2,"For jewellery, it's okay. For silver or silverplate flateware and serving pieces, use the old fashion 'Wrights Silver Polish'. You shall save yourself a great deal of time and elbow-grease with a much brighter, clean shine!!!",0
5,Love it! Fits! The material is not too thick or too thin. Affordable pricing also. Classy fit for a naturally curvy girl.,1
1,sent back. Did not like it.,0
5,"These sunglasses with the bifocal reader pane are just what I needed for outdoor activities like fishing.  I did not think I would like the blue lenses, but they are fine.  If they ever come out with amber lenses, I will get those, too.  It's so nice not to have to take my reading glasses out in the kayak!",1
5,"This dress was perfect, it fit perfectly all around.<br /><br />I would typically spend $200+ on a dress (that i never wear again) for my corporate holiday celebration, but this dress some GREAT Shoes and Perfect accessories definitely did the trick and most of all they saved me $200+. Great Value, i still have the dress and intend to keep it for re-use :)",1
1,This is NOT off the shoulder.... returning,0
5,Really great product,1
5,"very elegant.  nice material. i ordered the large, eventhough i wear medium. but it fitted perfectly. i recommemd it.",1
2,Bought this for my 6 year old boy since it had both the analog and digital face on it and thought that would be perfect for learning to tell time.  The face is large enough for my husband.  I'm returning the watch.  This watch shouldn't show up under &#34;boys&#34; watch.,0
2,I ordered a size up and it was way too small. Especially in the arms.,0
1,I tried to return it but they didn’t allow me to do so,0
5,Gave as a gift,1
3,"First I have a 38.5"" bust, and so orderd the XL. I love the green print and fit and flare shape, however this dress was awkward and baggy thru the underarms, and gapped at the bust. I sewed a snap to keep the front closed as a first fix. I also sewed the arms in a good inch at the armpit tapered to 3/8"" at the wrist and now the sleeves actually fit my arms nicely. As you can see the front pieces barely overlap where they are sewn in at the high waistline. I had to use body tape to keep the front flap CLOSED and not show my bra under the snap. This fabric is soft, but clingy. With the fun green print, it doesn't show too much, although static cling is a reality! Polyester fabric does NOT breathe, and isn't particularly warm in cool weather either. I wish this were made of a better quality fabric, but alas it is cute for the price.",0
4,Nice fit,1
2,"Pretty but runs small, sending it back",0
1,My son wore these for less than a week before the frame cracked in two pieces!  Next time I will just buy him a pair of dollar store sunglasses.,0
5,Great shirt,1
5,"I'm loving this bra. It's got the perfect fit, and a great feel. I've been wearing it all day and despite being an underwire, it's been comfortable with no issues.",1
5,"I am a home care nurse and this i perfect .Not to heavy, not too big. I can fit all the things I need for my visits in here. Side pockets are great for hand gel pumps",1
3,I don't think it's adequate to just order 1 size up.  This was very small.  I ordered a size XL for my XL son and it wouldn't fit him or my L son.  I still kept it for a much smaller person because the style is ok and the color works.  It is an ok product but not great.,0
5,Comfortable,1
5,Love these shorts and I never wear shorts! Fits amazing. Ordered 2 more pairs. Awesome!,1
1,It runs small and it’s suppose to be a dress but I found it to be more of a shirt. Once I tried it on it was very itchy felt like a wool sweater.,0
1,Obviously these are not pink like shown in the picture. Daughter very Disappointed!! Look more like men’s glasses,0
5,"Light weight enough to wear in summer, & can go over warmer clothing in cooler seasons.  Not too generous in sizing; I'm a 20 & probably the biggest it will fit comfortably.  I like it!!",1
4,it is one size fits all so it is as expected.,1
5,"Very soft, nice color. Accurate sizing.",1
5,"Just bought one today at Walmart and it's awesome! Will be wearing it to the 1st game tomorrow and for every single game from now on! My head is small so it hangs low and loose, but it fits nice and snug on top of a fitted New Era hat, which I'm sure I'll have to take off a few times here and there or when the GF wants to wear it instead, or if it rains.<br /><br />There were only 2 left at the store and each had their own cosmetic defects: the Seahawks decal on one wasn't applied cleanly and had wrinkles, the foam can have random holes in the eye or on mine a large nickel sized hole on the inside, and the white paint isn't 100% covered and is faded on some areas.  It was cheap enough ($20) to not bother, but will probably repaint the white or exchange it for a better one once they restock.",1
5,Wife Loves it!!,1
5,"I use these for making knitting progress keepers. They are lightweight and very durable.<br />I only ran into one issue, a couple had burrs on them from casting - easily fixable for me, so no effect on the review.<br />Well worth the cost.",1
3,Material is tooooo thin and delicate. Tears easily. Didn't lose color upon handwash with strong detergent though.,0
1,Do people a favor and quit sales now. You have the cheapest stuff. Really,0
5,Exceeded expectations.,1
1,Bought 6-8 for my slim 5 yr old boy… can’t even close the shirt/jacket on him. Barely got his arms in sleeves. I don’t have time to return so guess he’ll have to wear it open.,0
1,"Product was cheap material and shotty workmanship not all what I expected. When I printed out the return label the return label sent to me by the seller was gibberish and illegible. I took it to UPS store said even if it had been a good address, it would have cost me over 200.00 to return the item to China which is 300 times more that what I initially paid for it",0
5,"These are so comfortable and great to wear all day. Also, I love that heel is solid and doesn’t “clomp” when walking. Thinking about getting another pair in different color. Money well spent on these boots!",1
1,This dress runs small and is made of weird material. It also looks somewhat childish. Not what I expected from the photo at all.,0
5,Great priced bundle when it was on sale.,1
4,These are great for the money. Smaller phones like IPhone 6s size will fit in the hidden waist pocket and eliminate the need for am arm band to carry your cell phone. Super cute and comfy.,1
5,I liked that I could put them on any  pair of regular flip flops and transform them from plain to cute.,1
1,The fabric on this dress was too thick. I ordered it thinking it was a thin flowing fabric instead it was thick and stretchy.,0
2,Fit like a trash bag,0
3,"The product itself is nice, but the sizing is waaaay off. I ordered a size XL because according to ZEAGOO .measurements it would fit bust size 34.3&#34; I'm a 34C so should be just slightly loose on me. But the shirt that was shipped was A LOT bigger than the stated measurements. Had to return",0
5,"I like these shoes. I was skeptical at first, no tongue but easier to get on and off for triathlons. The price is amazing, I might need a second set!",1
1,"The right arm was WAY longer than the left.  If they were the same it would be a great shirt.  I purchased this item for my wedding and the right arm was over 3 inches longer than my left.  The whole wedding I said to my best man I was going to burn this shirt.  Guess what, 1 week later I did.",0
1,I don’t know about these they’re really prickly and that’s just not comfortable,0
5,Perfect size for a Crossbody bag... Fit everything I needed......Very Good purchase..,1
1,It did not meet up to my expectation.,0
1,Got watch for Christmas gift. Has same snaps on each end.,0
1,Turn dark very quickly.,0
5,"Unlike others I find this bag to be a very good size.  Not too small yet not too large it holds everything I'd need on a trip.  There's room for the shaver, beard trimmer, and other toiletries I typically take on a trip.  The 2 larger pockets are quite nice and supposedly water proof (I've not tested this but they look like they'd be).  The 2 smaller zipper pockets should hold smaller medicine containers but are on the same side of the bag making them not quite as useful as they seem.  Still, they're OK for the intended uses.<br /><br />The leather is a good quality and soft with strong stitching.  The handle can work from one end or the top and each large compartment has its own zipper (not a dual affair like other's I've used).  I like that.<br /><br />This one's a keeper.",1
5,Just okay,1
5,Great product! The lens fit better that some of the Oakley lens that I have. Will purchase from them in the future.,1
5,just love it,1
1,One of the rhinestones were missing from a few pair. Unsatisfied with the product,0
5,"I happened upon this product and decided to give it a try.  Since my family and I started using Sock Snaps, we haven't lost a single sock. Besides helping with the lost socks, its prevented endless searching for mis-sorted socks. Thanks for a great product. I highly recommend Sock Snaps!",1
4,Very cute. Fits as I had imagined it would. I like it!,1
5,I love it!! The dress hugs all my curves and it is simply elegant!!,1
1,"It's not a hat, it's a disaster. Came completely smashed in, it's formless and looks awful on my head.",0
5,"Bought these for my son, he loves them! You can’t go wrong, 3 for $17.99! I’d recommend them!",1
5,Perfect color and fit. Great for hour glass shape.,1
5,"Came right on time. Great material, and super cute. I cannot wait until my baby gets here, and gets to wear it.",1
1,"Material was entirely see through. Have no idea how they let this on the market, even when you put your hand inside you can clearly see it.<br /><br />Unless you want see through, rough material sweatpants, i don’t suggest buying",0
2,Tarnished quickly and no good quality silver.,0
1,"This dress was so far the worst online shopping experience. The fabric is low quality, the shape is weird, the waist is ridiculously high, it would probably only work for very short people but I am 5’8’’ and it looks terrible. In addition, my arms are not too skinny for my general size but sleeves are to wide which kills the whole look. Returning.",0
5,I get so many compliments on this necklace and it goes with literally anything! Highly recommend!,1
1,I would not recommend this product.,0
1,"I had high hopes for this bag, but after a few months of this being my daily work bag the straps are already showing signs of breaking from the sides of the bag. I keep a small light weight laptop and a reasonable amount of personal items in it. I certainly do not over-stuff it. It's very attractive and the pockets are great, but it's just not durable.",0
4,Even though it was kind of small I love the dress. It was too long but that's everything I order. I'm 4'11 and my mom just hemmed it to fit my height. I love the colors.,1
2,I loved the dress! But had to rerun due to the rips on the sides :( total bummer! I just ordered another one hoping it doesn’t come defective!,0
2,"It was 29 degrees here in Florissant, Co this AM and we went over to our property to watch our modular home be set on the foundation.  We had ordered two pair of these gloves and this AM we froze our hands off.  Don't believe that they will be good to -40.  A real big disappointment for the money.",0
4,Love these! Got them for my kids and myself. Fit my kids perfectly. Not so much myself. A little tight but workable. We paired them up with skeleton stockings and were perfect! So many people loved them! We matched perfectly too! Great for everyday use!,1
3,Good but some balls were cracked or missing completely.,0
3,No instructions included. Need micro phillips head screw driver to disassemble buckle. Tail end of belt tucks in behind belt. Clean look but takes some getting use to. Belt serves it's purpose.,0
1,Horrible!!!! Wore once and the gold plating completely wore off!!!!,0
2,I have been ordering dresses online for the last month in this same size. This dress out of 6 that I have ordered is the only one that did no fit.,0
5,"I loved this dress! I wore to wedding and got so many compliments. It's a fun, cute dress.  I paired with nude heels once and wedges another time.",1
5,Well packaged and my girlfriend loved it.,1
2,Runs very small!,0
5,These tops are absolutely beautiful.,1
3,"I’m 5’2, these got a little baggy and saggy after a few hours.",0
5,Granddaughter loved it!,1
1,Shirt did not fit like the pic showed. Did not look sewed correctly.,0
2,"Pants did not hv enough stretch to them in the buttocks! My rear end is the highlight of any outfit and she could not shine.... the first was very Plummer butt-esk.  Jacket was ahight, not crazy about the white lining but I guess I get what u pay for.",0
4,Cute dress,1
1,"I'm disappointed. I got these about a month ago and my boyfriend and I were so excited and couldn't wait to wear them. My boyfriend wore his for barely a week or two and ended up having his neck turned green while my neck was still clear. But the worse part is, is how they break easily. My boyfriend didn't realized his necklace was caught onto my tank top after waking up in the morning, and before he could even reach it while stopping to fix it, it snapped in half. He was so sad and hurt that I was too pissed off and just completely wasted my money on something that wasn't a strong enough product. I wish this was so much better and could really do a better job on making the necklaces a lot better and the charms a bit stronger. This was a waste of money and it broke our hearts.",0
2,"Sorry too small and too late to return, wasted my $$",0
4,"I really enjoyed this suit, my biggest issue is the shipping method it took quite a while to receive so if your wanting it now don't count on it, other wise it is a great suit the bottoms actually fit well which is something I have an issue with! And I live the fact that it covers my stomach but it still makes me feel flattering!",1
1,"Sent a different bracelet, very disappointed!",0
1,Not what I expected.,0
3,These are tiny!  More of a girls glove than a women’s glove.,0
5,Bought it for my friend.  He really likes it!,1
5,"Great quality, fits great, looks great",1
3,"I was so excited about this coat and when it came I was a bit disappointed. The jacket is large, heavy and rough. Also, The color is not as vibrant as I thought it would be. I do like the design. The picture is similar to the design, minus the purple having more orange in it. Overall, I will &#34;make it work&#34; but am not completely satisfied. Order one size down in the Elf Sack clothing.",0
3,"Colors were pretty she was excited,, until she bent over and it teared right up the side.",0
5,"I got this pretty dress yesterday, really love it, great fit.",1
1,Wrong size,0
1,"Cute, soft tank. However, after a couple wears/washes, it REALLY stretches out.  Now I can only wear with another tank underneath. But I don’t because the shape is no longer flattering.",0
3,"Bought for a Disney trip. Cute skirt, but inner shorts are white mesh and see through. One good breeze and I’d be flashing the kiddos. Returning.",0
2,Smells like dead fish,0
5,Nice earrings!  Very Shiny and smooth.,1
1,"These are not hawthorn  its false advertisement , comes with no logo and cheap cheap material 🙄😭 i wasnt careful enough when ordering brand says heynuts hawthorn!! I own hawthorn and therlse are definitely not !!! And they are not returnable , if you ship them back to China it costs $100+!! Definitely pissed off and amazon is only offering to refund 30% back becausethey'vealreadypaid for shippingonce 🤬!! Wtf these are almost 30 dollars i bought 2!!!🤬🤬😤😤",0
5,Impressed!! Amazon just dropped this off about 10 minutes ago and I decided to just go ahead and clean my favorite pair of Nikes. I’ve owned them for two years and normally would’ve just donated these and bought new..but Nike doesn’t make them anymore. So I decided to try this product.<br /><br />I spent a max of five minutes cleaning..and for anyone who knows me KNOWS I hate cleaning so I didn’t even give my best effort. But the picture shows just how great the cleaner did at lifting the dirt! I’m pleased and will be using the protect spray once it arrives!,1
2,The button/snap was broken upon arrival. had to repair,0
3,"I’m 5’6 & 210lbs.<br />Ordered in white , size XXL .<br />It fit fine.<br />The arms are attached to dress (not sewn in with pattern) & easy to remove by just cutting the thread.<br />It IS light fabric & IS a bit see through but I wear a slip under it & it blends fine.<br />I purchased this when discount was offered.",0
5,Lovely soft leather bag. Perfect for errands when you don't want a bulky bag. I have a number of colors to change out for fun!,1
1,"I got a big size because I don't mind oversized comfy sweatshirts and I'm not the kind of person that is worried about looking fat or whatever, but this sweatshirt is particularly unflattering and makes me just look obese.  Also, I was going for comfort and there are seams in the arms that you can feel.  Just... no.",0
1,I didn't know it was see-through...,0
5,This dress is sized perfectly as far as plus sizes go. Buy your usually size. I added fur and thicker cording to the lace-up area. This dress is extremely comfortable and was durable. One of the sewn in ribbons in the back did pop out when I first tried it on because I didn’t loosen the corset area. It was an easy fix. The hood is adorable and it worked perfectly for my costume. I received a ton of compliments and would buy again.,1
3,Color was not pink,0
1,"It's very cheaply made, the ring that holds the chain to the key part was coming apart and the picture is blurry. Would not recommend this at all.",0
1,[[VIDEOID:f77681cb2de768d399ceda26abf1bd6c]],0
2,"I loved this when it arrived. Then I put it on the watch. It's really cute! It's easy to get the watch on and off with a quick rip of velcro! That's where my good comments end. The ends that hook into the watch are plastic. The band was pretty easy to install onto the watch. Then: One end kept coming off. I kept putting it back on. Then I decided I'd had it and needed to return it. And I couldn't get the other end off! It was completely stuck. This is not worth the money. Of course, Google is charging $60 for their bands, so that's outrageous. I would like a reasonably priced band that does the job. This wasn't it.",0
2,I am a huge fan of costume jewelry. So to see this neck piece without character is a  let down. The necklace is pretty much a flat butterflies with a necklace that can't lay straight. This butterfly would look much better if it was 3d.,0
4,"Very nice earrings and very large. I knew they would be large, but didn't expect quite so much. Still very nice and light weight. The picture shows more of a silver color, but they are actually more pewter in color.",1
5,"I love the fit and way the coat is made. Fits perfect, no need to over adjust the inside belt. Keeps me warmer than I expected. Thanks.",1
4,Gave these to my son for his birthday.  He really likes them.,1
5,Looked great,1
3,"It's mediocre quality. It fit good, but the color faded way too quickly.",0
3,actual earrings look so different and are much bigger than i thought very heavy and uncomfortable to wear .,0
3,Although I like the shirt but its small. Contacted seller<br />But didnot heard back.,0
1,My son was upset it doesn't even open!!!,0
3,"I think they are very pretty, but are heavier and bigger than they look on the photo",0
1,Ugly,0
5,"arrived on time, beautiful ring, and really large! It makes a statement for sure.",1
1,"This item is huge! Did not fit a two year old or four year old. Also, it rolled up funny.",0
5,"Great material, have washed it many times without any breakdown. Good fit, stays on my head all day. Also like the sweat band insert.",1
5,"HIGH QUALITY!!  This Beanie Hat is well crafted of acrylic and wool!<br /><br />When I received this hat, I was IMPRESSED at how well it was made.  This hat just screams QUALITY!  It looks EXPENSIVE and STYLISH!  This hat will make a GREAT gift for anyone, both men or women.  The pattern only adds to its Elegance...it is a white design that reminds you of those ski sweaters.  A super FANTASTIC feature is that the inside of the hat has a furry lining!  The lining is perfectly stitched.  This is really one well crafted hat!  It also has a leather tag sewn onto the front.<br /><br />This Dragon Squama hat is WARM!  It is COMFORTABLE as the lining is so CUDDLY SOFT!!  This hat is sure to keep you warm in the coldest of winter!  It is large enough to fit most size heads!  DH has a bit of a large head and it fits him well!  He ABSOLUTELY LOVES this hat!  It looks good and is EFFICIENT!<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hat.  It makes an EXCELLENT gift choice!  It presents well and really does scream QUALITY!<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this item for my honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are my own based on personal experience.",1
5,"Gorgeous, fabulous, fits perfectly!",1
3,"It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but, again, it's alright and will work.",0
2,"They said in review that they fit true to size, not true fit small",0
5,Bought as a gift she loves it.,1
5,nice product looks good,1
5,Best buy out there for roll on bracelets.........6 pretty and basic colors....maybe next purchase will have some designs....well worth the money and quick to receive.  Will definitely order more.,1
5,I love it!,1
5,Bought this for my son. He says it really helps in this 100+ temps.,1
5,They work great,1
2,"Fits true to size, but shoulders have a strange shoulder pad appearance. Does not fit like picture depicts. Will return.",0
3,"Its to big, I buy median is it same size large",0
1,"The first time I ordered this item, I received shiny red size 9.5 stilettos instead. Customer Service tried to fix it, twice, and each time I received shiny red stilettos. No Easter shoes for my daughter. Disappointing.",0
1,I read off the reviews for this luggage prior to purchasing and it had great reviews. I took the 31&#34; with me to Jamaica and it did NOT survive Customs. This is the very first time I used this luggage and am so very disappointed with this purchase. Unfortunately the window to return expired while I was still out of the country. What a freakin' rip off!! Cute and stylish but I do not recommend for international travel.,0
2,It's not even working. The watch won't keep time!,0
2,The leather began peeling off I wish it’d worked out super disappointed it was so beautiful for about 2 weeks. I hoped it was more durable for leather. Maybe it isn’t real leather.,0
5,"Super cute and comfy, definitely going to be buying in more colors!",1
1,Poor quality due to the nickel in it.  I am highly allergic to nickel so now it just sits on the desk.,0
2,Material looked very Table Clothish. Was very dissapointed,0
3,"like the watch, but have to push the button to see the time",0
5,Great. Fit big but really helps prevent getting scratched or bitten by cats when grooming,1
2,They're built well but arrived crooked and without the lanyard,0
1,Sizes are both true,0
5,They came in a tiny packet for each anklet which was graceful and easy to sort !!,1
3,Little small across the chest.,0
5,"These are SO cute, they look absolutely adorable on my little girl.  She says they're comfortable and I have a pair in adult size so I can tell you that the leather on these is remarkable with almost no break-in period at all.  They do seem to run a bit large, but that just gives them room to grow, adjust your lacing and wear thick socks, you should be OK.",1
5,My daughter absolutely loves them! Delivery came on time,1
3,nice,0
5,My legs stopped hurting the 2nd day,1
5,Perfect size for my purse.,1
4,Very cute bag. I as well took off the patch in the front very simple and kept it plain very easy to come off and love it like this. Honestly I almost bought the actual brand ones but decided to give this one a chance to get like a look it's about the same actually. Only thing is it did have a weird inside smell.,1
5,I love the pattern and knowing I can wear these with a short skirt and show my panties!,1
4,"Carters is cute. I&#34;m sure this fits fine, they just sent me the wrong size",1
1,It was to big and not stick at all not good,0
5,Great product to buy,1
4,very good quality,1
1,The design is really cool as I love Harry Potter but the design makes it so large it covers so much of my face that it’s by my eyes and then I can’t really breathe through it even when I removed the filter it’s a fairly non breathable material. So I can’t use it.,0
4,"My son loves these pajamas, the colors are vibrant. We washed it twice and it still looks good",1
3,Too much fabric for 32 b,0
1,HOW DO I RETURN THE TROUSERS???,0
1,Gray was too tight and too long.<br />Bought same size/brand in black and fit perfectly.🤷,0
2,I had been very happy with this bag up until my last use. One side of the bag completely ripped open from the seam. I know bags can be damaged by the airline but this bag has only been a carry on. Never as a checked bag. Very unhappy as it probably has been used only 10 times even tho I’ve owned it over a year now.,0
5,"This is a very nice necklace you can give as a gift to your Mother.<br />It comes in a nice little box, sparkles bright and will make her smile.<br />Not sure the quality but will update you if anything happens.<br />I would recommend for the price!",1
5,Excelente,1
5,Very cute! Fast shipping.,1
5,Items arrived on time.<br />Love the modern look!,1
3,Loved the front of this suit - but the backside is VERY cheeky - meaning if like showing almost half of each butt cheek or are a Card carrying member of the No Assatol Club - this maybe this is for you.  I hoped that by having a center panel in back - it would cup each side favorably - unfortunately NO :(,0
2,I ordered a pair a year ago but since thenilost weight so I ordered another pair cause I liked the first pair. The shorts I recieved were made different.,0
5,"For an inexpensive shoe you honestly cannot beat the price.  I mean it is not a hundred dollar shoe, but they sure look nice when they are brand new.",1
5,They fit well to my swiss army watch,1
1,They feel very uncomfortable. The fit is terrible. Not recommended.,0
4,Seems like good quality leather. Could have been a few inches larger. Happy so far.,1
4,"Pretty cute.  A bit of a rough finish,  but they are fine for my project.",1
4,"For what you pay this obviously wont last forever, but it is still cute nonetheless!",1
5,"Just arrived home and they were waiting on my door step. I couldn't wait to try them on and I love them! They are stretchy enough that ordering in your regular size should fit just fine. I'm a curvy girl, so I ordered a size XXL and they fit comfortably. The stretch doesn't give too much and the material is comfy.<br /><br />They are a bit long, but you can either have them tailored or cuff them. I love the high waist. As a mom, I don't have to worry about sitting down and my pants revealing my undies! I wish they made these in more colors because I would buy them all. Very happy with how these jeans fit.",1
5,Love it,1
5,Great quality,1
5,"Women's plus size tunic<br />Nice, color, fits well.  Material is thin but it's still ok.  Very nice for summer.",1
5,Love love love the material of this shirt!! It is thin and very light and was just what I was looking for. It is softer than cotton and breathable . I will be buying more,1
5,I love the fit and drape if this dress. So COMFORTABLE!!,1
2,Wish this worked - purchased an XL - size in person looked like a Toddler's 3T.<br />Returned & would not recommend.,0
1,"These under armour briefs are nothing compared to the thing you used to get a year ago. These are thinner, and if you sweat alot when you work like I do cos I'm constantly moving, the butt/crotch cretin wears out quick. Not worth $11 per pair. Might as well wear hanes now",0
3,"So far, the only reply I can contest to is looks & weight  of said sandal.",0
5,"Decent quality. Complemented good our bday surprise party. Would buy it again, and recommend it. Shipping was fast as usual through amazon prime.",1
4,It's nice but has a residue smell,1
2,Weird fit,0
3,If you have thick hair... or waist length hair... this will not fit with your hair wrapped up in it. Very disappointing... although I do have A LOT of hair so maybe I should have assumed.,0
5,I like everything about it,1
5,"This is all the memories of my childhood, awesome.",1
5,"These are the best leggings I have found to date...the material is thick, yet breathable. The waistband is comfortable and doesn’t create the muffin top some leggings tend to do. They are just the right length (I am 5’7” 180lbs and 6 weeks postpartum, I bought a large) I now own 3 pairs and they are my go to leggings!!",1
5,I wear them everyday!!! So good for the price,1
2,I thought this was very retro and cute! The dress that was sent to me was not like the one pictured. It was a small waist but big on top and a weird flare. I ended up returning it.,0
3,"This dress is very cute but the material pills and fades like crazy even when hand-washed in cold water. It also runs a bit large. I am pear-shaped and normally struggle with dresses being too tight on my lower half, but this one is almost shapeless even in my usual size because it is cut wide through the hips. On the other hand the arms and chest were quite tight on me, so sizing down wouldn't have worked either.",0
5,Very pretty ring. I love it. Exactly what I wanted.,1
1,Product runs small,0
2,"So I DID like this belt a lot... at first.<br />It’s comfy to wear and stretches so if you get bigger this belt is great<br /><br />4 months into owning it and this thing is useless. The equivalent of a shoelace around my waist, if not worse than that.<br />I find myself pulling up my pants all the time, or hosting them up because this thing just isn’t working<br /><br />In my case I lost weight and it seems like after it’s stretched it doesn’t stretch back<br /><br />Now when I wear it i feel like a shoe string would do a better job as a belt<br />It does keep my pants from completely falling down but it really doesn’t do much more than BARELY keeping up my pants<br /><br />It’s just meh, and for the high price I think there’s better items on the market",0
1,Horrible even for a child,0
5,It was very short. I lived the pattern and the feel of the item.,1
1,"The hat was really cheap and the lettering was printed on and faded. Not stitched. Really cheaply made, kind of disappointed :(",0
5,"Love this swim suit, need a new one! I want this same exact one though! NOT something similar! I want to repurchase this one. It’s perfect for a more modest swim suit, the bottoms fit weird but the top was perfect!",1
4,Works well and got the job done. Keep the box to hold everything.,1
4,Very comfortable on the wrist. Felt tight at first but two fingers easily fits under the band. Need to be careful when putting the device in the brace. It looked too big but does fit in frame. Only suggestion would be a softer material,1
2,It is very large and very cheap.,0
3,Nice shirt just runs small I wear a large and ordered a X-Lg wanting it loose but it just fits,0
5,Nice quality doesn’t peel off,1
5,Love these!!! Bought them to wear for Halloween for a 1950's costume. Looked great!,1
3,I bought this out of whim because the picture looked very cute on the model. I wasn’t a huge fan of the look once it was on but I paired it with a denim jacket and faux leather leggings for a casual running errands look which made it look better than it did by itself. I did receive a compliment but it just wasn’t my favorite! The top is light weight which was nice because it wasn’t too hot.,0
1,no instructions; not bubbles free;<br /><br />now trying to get it off my S7,0
1,You can barely see the letters and the hat is small. Will be returning it.,0
5,"Love it. Order in LARGER SIZE, its beautiful but comes taged in a large but is really a small",1
2,"I like the look of the brushed aluminum, but like all sunglasses I should have tried them on before buying. The lens frames are gigantic and dont sit well on the nose. The size of the frames sort of resembles that of novelty gigantic sunglasses that clowns wear.",0
5,"I am so happy that I bought this from Amazon. The price was incredible, not to mention the quality. I will definetley come back to Amazon in the future, My handbag would have cost 285.00 if I would have bought it in the store, but I only paid 169.00 here through Amazon, I am so very happy!!!",1
4,"I only got about two duplicates and most of them were pretty cute. I wish the variety had been better, but overall this was worth it.",1
1,The material is too thick and you have a hard time breathing through it,0
5,"Love it! My very particular 8 year old loves it. Material is soft and best of all for mom, it is made for a little girl! Modest, comfortable and adorable. Very pleased.",1
5,"Somewhat small but it is nice, airy fabric.",1
5,"Got these for my best friend as a birthday gift, and she loves them!! They are super cute and look really cute on a denim jacket!",1
2,"Got this in the mail today and only recieved the nude bra. The little baggy it comes with, the zipper is ripped off almost completely. The nude will do but, I would have liked to have both bras since it is what I paid for.",0
3,Just not to my liking. Too fitting. Like jeans! Expected a looser relaxed fit.,0
2,"The dress was beautiful, but it had discoloration on the back and front. It almost looked like bleach or something got on it. I wanted to wear it for engagement photos, but the spot was too big to ignore",0
1,Came bunched in medium size bag. Late and didn’t look like pictures advertisement.,0
5,This is a very nice purse.  The handles are very secure and a comfortable size to carry. The purse had an open pocket and a zipper pocket inside.  Both are roomy.  The purse is beautiful.,1
1,The face print on this was sized for a giant and looks ridiculous.  Not as pictured.,0
5,Really superb quality!!!,1
3,It was small given the size especially the arm and bust. If you are buying an xl it is because you have something to put in the shirt.,0
5,Excellent combination with my biking knickers--no longer do I have that one little part of my legs that gets really cold.,1
5,Cute keychain,1
4,"Cute, but way to small",1
3,Not really as I expected. The colour is dull,0
1,The shirt is not correct in size. The bear pealed off after one wash. I ended up just using the shirt as a rag! I wish I didn't spend money on this shirt!,0
5,"I purchased this for my teenage daughter, she has an extensive collection of different types of animal ears. This is actually made pretty well and is sturdy, maybe not for a little girl, but definitely over 7 or so.  Very cute and adorable on my daughter, and she's 18!",1
1,I gave this as a gift.I'm embarrassed that I did so. It fall apart the first week it was used. The screws did not stay screwed in.,0
5,"I was very happy with the product, reasonable price, unbelievably fast shipping, recieved in only about 3 or 4 days after ordering! will be useful for learning the bones in my anatomy and physiology class- bones are true to life- from the sutures of the skull right down to the bones in the toes! thank you!",1
5,"I love them, very comfortable!",1
1,I bought this thinking this would be cool comfortable shirt. I wear a size 18. I tried it on it was awful. It was not plus size at all. I gave it my mom who is a 12-14 and it was horrible on her too. I do not recommend.,0
5,Good deal. perfect fit. material does not feel cheap.,1
1,Sunglasses broke after a week of wear,0
3,"To short to be a dress period! But, Made 😍 Cute! Nice yellow color!",0
5,"It's very well made little skull, but I never expected how tiny is!!!! You can see the size between the coin and the skull ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️ but anyway I'll use somewhere can I find!",1
3,Wrong color hat it was blue,0
4,This fits fairly well. I'm 5'5 126Lb 33 inches B-Cup and bought the Large. Anthing less than than the large would have been to snug.,1
5,Liked the item!,1
3,Cute.. wish it would have fit,0
3,"These were good as hosiery, but i could not keep them from sliding down.",0
3,Product is sized small,0
3,It is nothing like the pictures. I was expecting an off the shoulder shirt maybe made out of some fabric like cotton. I received the item a lot faster than expected but was slightly disappointed over all. Cute enough to keep but not what I was expecting.,0
5,"I received these glasses and loved them, they looked great and were super comfortable. However they must have broke in transit. These things happen I understand. The seller contacted me personally apologizing, and reimbursemed me fully with a new pair of glasses. Extremely satisfied with my purchase.",1
5,amazing product for the prize. very soft and material and comfortable to wear,1
2,Side of the dress was separated at the seam about 2-3 inches so now have to sew it😏,0
1,Worse ever I threw it away after a few weeks the color changed. Total garbage!!!,0
4,Band too short; good watch,1
2,Soft but cheap material way too loose,0
5,Love this dress! It is comfy and dressy! And has pockets!,1
3,"After second wash on gentle , the fabric  has lots of tiny balls, smooth finish is gone.",0
5,Made not to break easily.  I will wear the soles out,1
4,Ordered these for my little girl for school. They are cute after a couple months i have noticed some wear to them but cant really blame the shoes lol what kid doesnt like to splash in puddles..overall a good name brand shoe,1
1,Sized for small people,0
5,I like very this dress !! I would order more. True to size and not to short !! Love I will post pictswhen I wear,1
4,Unique. I luv them.,1
1,This rings are for girls with little fingers I had to throw mine away they wer like for a 3 year old ..ti bad they dint work out...,0
4,as advertised. arrived on-time,1
5,"awesome! very fast shipping, and this small thing replaced my whole wallet... it fits for 8 cards easily!",1
1,These pants are cheaply made.,0
5,So much better than its advertised. It’s lightweight and has a drawstring in the back to adjust the tightness.,1
2,"The Big Guy has a big head. These glasses did not fit. While they were a little wider than usual, the side stems did not reach back far enough. We got a different pair for about $25 on Amazon that are truly XL and fit him beautifully. I strongly recommend you measure the frames that currently fit and compare it to the measurements listed here. These are not the ones you want.",0
3,Product looks exactly as described an in pic but they run very big so would definitely want to get a size smaller maybe even 2 sizes smaller,0
3,Cute hat but shrunk after one wash.,0
4,"i like this shirt very much.  It goes with shorts, jeans or just about anything.",1
4,I love the material it looks expensive and the looks it is very nice .. it could l have been perfect if I ordered size smaller than my regular size ..,1
3,"they are very small, child like",0
1,"Looks nothing like the picture, very ugly",0
5,This is so beautiful.  Much more than I expected for the price.,1
1,"This dress is a knock off of the photo. It feels polyester and cheap. This dress clings, is heavy and when stretched it changes from black to grey. The original is probably a rayon type light weight flowy fabric. This isn't.  There is a little color difference and tiny floral pattern change most wouldn't notice. The side slits are not that drastic which makes them look redundant and pockets were set high not low. I am not posting a photo in it cause it isn't flattering.  I ordered on 12/04/19, delivery date changed twice and amazon assumed it was lost. It wasn't worth the wait. Maybe for someone under a size 12 that is less curvy (i have an hourglass figure) it would be flattering but not recommended for anyone larger .",0
5,Very lovely ring. Lots of compliments.,1
5,Love these! I received these shoes for Mother's Day. I wore them to church and was surprised at how comfortable they were. I received lots of compliments on them. I will definitely buy more of this brand.,1
3,Fits well looks good but has strong smell<br />Leather to moldy<br />Bought 2 same smell,0
3,Cool hat but the quality of the hat is very cheap. Flea market hat and they just had a fancy shmancy  embroidery for the writing,0
3,"Ordered a medium. I’m 36c, 27 waist, 140 lbs. The top fit ok but the bottoms were just a little baggy for me.",0
5,"These are great “kicking around” shorts for the beach, hiking, or just hanging out. I primarily got them for walks on the beach. They have lots of pockets for collecting shells, agates, etc., with room left over for my wallet, sunglasses and keys. They’re well made, and the fabric is a sort of medium-to-light weight cotton chino fabric. Not heavy or stiff, but also not flimsy. You can see in the photo with the fabric scrunched up, how thick the fabric is. The seams are consistent and very well done - with multiple lines of stitching. The elastic waist makes them very comfortable, yet you can also use a belt if you don’t want to show the elastic waist. I found these to be even nicer than the vendor photos show. The elastic drawstring at the bottom of each leg, lets you cinch them in a bit and make them look “cooler” and more laid back. Very true to size. I definitely recommend.",1
1,Too short,0
4,They seemed reliable. My granddaughter is happy.,1
1,"These shorts run way to small, & they gave me a diaper booty fit. I will not be purchasing again. Had to return",0
5,Really like this hat,1
4,"Fits perfect, comfortable & looks classy with some nice accessories and high heels. Got a lot of compliments!",1
3,Returned for a full refund. Beautiful blouse as long as you are a size 8 or smaller.,0
5,I love it. It's exactly as pictured. Shiny. Lightweight.,1
1,I wanted to love this top. It’s has a beautiful shape and color . BUT the sewing is awful . Lots of loose threads along the crochet part and the neck was sewn crooked. Returned it.,0
3,Yes,0
5,Thank you for delivery fully satisfied,1
2,The pads in the cup move from it place and look bad,0
4,"This case is just a little too big for my needs, but all the other cases I had were just a little too small.  So, I prefer to not have my glasses crushed, and this case does the job.<br /><br />The dimensions are slightly smaller than the stated 6"" long x 2.25"" tall x 3"" wide, unless my ruler is broken.  I measured outside 6"" long x 2"" tall x 2.75"" wide.  Inside 5 1/2"" long x 2"" tall x 2 1/2"" wide.  The lining touches the bottom & top of the case on the inside, but the sides are sort of flared, and that eats up some of the side to side & front to back space.<br /><br />As other reviewers stated, it does seem to shed a little in the beginning...I've had mine for 10 days, & it seems to have stopped already.  I didn't carry a cloth to wipe off, I just used my breath to blow it off & that seemed to work fine to clean the lenses of the ""fluff"".<br /><br />I would buy again if I needed to.  For the price you can't really beat it.  The outside construction is very sturdy.  The lining inside is also very nice, but, I'm not too sure how it is attached to the outside, so that will be interesting to see if it reamins attached.  If I remember, I'll update this review after some more use.",1
4,This took forever to get to me but now that I have they are all I will use :)<br /><br />Thanks,1
4,Very nice,1
5,THIS DRESS FITS GREAT AND IT IS A HEAVY MATERIAL THAT CAUSES IT TO FALL PERFECTLY TO YOUR SHAPE. WILL BE ORDERING MORE COLORS.,1
5,I loved it. Everyone has sucked me wheee I got it from,1
2,Not enough support,0
5,Fits perfect and washes well,1
1,"Horrible Mask, don’t buy",0
5,"Perfect gold bag for the wedding I was attending. I love the versatility of this bag, wristlet to a long strap to wear across your body. Love it so much!",1
5,Very comfortable and true to size.,1
5,I really love also this one.. I csn already replace my wedding ting eith ths perfect ring. It sooo shinny and i love it. The size is perfect and tru..,1
1,Looks much better online. Didn't like the material at all. Not worth the price. Not flattering. Returned.,0
5,Just a piece of art LOVE it.,1
1,"Does work for my daughter, I think she's a super soaker but, it goes right through.",0
3,"The colors are not varied to the extent as shown in the picture.  The product arrived intact, no missing stones, however the stones are all a bright/royal blue, None of the sky blue.and those 'white' stones are actually inlay rhinestones.  If I hold the necklace up to the light, I can see that different types/paints were used on what was to be the lighter sky-blue intended stones, but in 'normal' light, they're just swirls in the same blue as the rest.  Not a high dollar expense, and my expectations were not high, but I do want what I order to arrive looking like the picture.<br /><br />If you're looking for a royal blue necklace with a few rhinestone embedded accents, this works.  I'll give it an OK, but what I really wanted was the versatility of different blue colors that unfortunately I didn't get,",0
5,Dress fits true to size. Very classy for an event or summer evening out,1
3,"Overall good quality fabric and design. However, there is one downside which costs two stars: the handle on the pocket zip is SHARP, you might cut yourself and people close to you if not careful.",0
4,This suit is so gorgeous. Unfortunately it's a bit big so I'm having to get it altered or it would of been 5 stars for sure.,1
3,The design on the top is super cute. I ordered a medium. The straps do not adjust. It comes with cups inside the top. The inside of the top has a thin thread line to keep the cups in place and does not seem sturdy. Mine even had a loose thread. The bottoms are much better quality but are small and tight fitting. They are also very &#34;cheeky&#34; bottoms. The double side straps are sturdy but do not adjust.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review.,0
2,It was only 6 pairs of gloves. Not a great deal for the price. The picture on the ad shows 8 or 9 pairs.,0
2,These chain extenders go from gold to silver in the matter of a week or two. They looked nice at first but now my necklace just looks odd. It extends your necklace but it doesn't look very good unless you have hair that will cover the extender.,0
5,I had originally wanted a Luminox blackout watch. After visiting an authorized dealer and handling the Luminox watches; I felt they were inferior to the Armourlite in almost all categories. The jeweler showed me the Armourlite watches and I immediately fell for them. Here is a list of features they have (vs. Lumninox)<br /><br />* Reversed position crown (this is so bad-ass!)<br />* T100 glows very bright (dominates luminox T25)<br />* Rubber watch band is extremely comfortable<br />* Saphire crystal STANDARD (no extra cost for ultimate scratch resistance!)<br />* Blackout numbering font is really unique!<br />* Movable bezel is really useful when diving (or timing yourself during any activity)<br />* Second hand has ZERO vibration with the tick (Ronda Swiss Movement)<br />* New brand (This is unique! Very few people will have the same watch as you! But they'll want one!)<br />* Spare cloth watch band can replace silicone band and still looks great!<br /><br />I would highly recommend you abandon your pursuit of the Luminox blackout and give this one a try! It will not disappoint!<br /><br />Finally: Click &#34;Add to cart&#34; and enjoy this amazing watch!<br />I own the &#34;ISO203-MIL&#34; model,1
3,Runs a little small. Cant wear underwear with it,0
1,I guess you get what you pay for!  These thongs underwear look good and all but they fall apart after you wear them once.  Now I know why the American made men's underwear cost more..!,0
5,Shipping was timely and the piece is beautiful.,1
5,These shoes are so cute and adorable on my 19 month old baby girl. They look just like the pictures. A great purchase!,1
2,It did not say it was going to be 3/4 quarter length so it looked like I was a child wearing them you know having pants that are too small and are like pedal pushers that is pretty much what this was,0
3,"Y'all I don't know what some of the reviews were saying about being able to wear this to work, it's SHORT. And I'm 5 foot 4, so I'm not anywhere near the tall end of things. I usually struggle with things being too long, but this? It comes to a full 5 inches above my knees. I was hoping to wear this to work with flats and a cardigan, but I'm going to reserve it for chilly nights out and wear it with tights. Love the pockets and the color though!",0
1,"This fit just right, it is not oversized as the picture and description indicate. The sweater came in a vacuum sealed package which may have effected the fluffiness of the sweater. The sweater was thin and did not give the appearance of a chunky and warm sweater. I am returning this sweater. So disappointed",0
1,"Very nice and comfortable on my 10yr old. I ordered a size smaller (I think the ages 6/7?), Bc reviews said they run big, and they definitely do.<br /><br />UPDATE: we had a very warm winter last year,  so my son wore these just a few times. Last week,  he wore them for an hour or so to play outside,  and there are 2 large tears on one of them!  I bought these a year ago,  but my son wore these just a handful of times.",0
5,Beautiful,1
5,"These are a bit of a tight fit for me...but that's ok, I'm using them for winter biking...not combat. They have a good feel,  and the materials are very high quality, and well made..",1
3,"It's very pretty, it's smaller only 7inches not 7.5",0
1,Mask was too small - I had to keep pulling it down to see.,0
5,Ordered this dress for a concert and it fit just beautifully.  I love the lightweight material and for the price it was very elegant.  I would definitely purchase again.  It was true to fit and I actually could have ordered a size lower and it would have worked just fine.  Love this dress!!!!,1
1,"Very cute. The smell on them was crazy strong though.... Almost like gasoline. But I'm sure you could air them out. They were pretty comfy... But I haven't worn them out yet. My toes didn't feel squished, and I have rather long toes so...<br /><br />Edit... Wore them out and just walking both straps broke off.,, effing ridiculous...3 they're rather wife so you really need the strap..",0
4,"Very nice bathing suit, but I think it is too reveal for my type of body.",1
1,My mask is broke,0
1,Cheap material,0
2,Nice hat but it is very small.  One gust of wind and it would be gone!!!  Good for a child.,0
4,"Fit was larger than expected, but this tunic top is very warm, soft and comfortable and perfect for Winter evenings snuggled up in front of the fire.  Washes well.",1
2,"For a medium one would have said a Large, it was a gift for my mother, ja'i even had the impression that it was an XL. So I had to give it to another person.",0
3,"This dress is overall nice and good value. It fits strangely on me sadly, but I’m 6’1” and an hourglass size 18 so everything fits me strangely. The waist rises really high and the fabric has no stretch so it doesn't hug or conform if you’re looking for that. The material wrinkles very quickly but I wore it to a concert where it didn’t really matter. It’s cute as heck but you get what you pay for.",0
1,"I have no idea if i like this hat since I bought two of these for my kids over three weeks ago. It said, ships in 2 days, although that may be true, it takes a month after that. I really wish THAT was noted before purchasing. So now my kids have a gift not coming until the new year even though I ordered it the first few days of December. So far, not pleased. I sure hope the quality is good enough to make it worth the wait.",0
5,All good. No dislikes,1
1,"Ordered S in light khaki, fit like an XS which is what I wanted, but arrived with two buttons popped off and it was a purple color rather than the light orange/tan that I wanted. Returned.",0
3,The shirt fit as expected and is of a good material. The quality of the print is not one that will last. After a couple months the coat of the arms on the back started to crack. This is not a typical screen print that is in the fabric. It's more like a press on decal. It went from being a nice shirt to wear out of the house to one that I'll only wear when working in the garage or doing chores around the house.,0
3,"The size ran small on these, my son only got a few uses out of them before they were no longer usable. Still he did enjoy them very much when he wore them.",0
5,So little and cute! Shortest stud/post I've found which is what I was looking for!,1
5,He loves it!! Had one before and tried many others but this is the only kind we will buy now,1
1,The flower pin attached to the ribbon at the waist was completely rusted when I took it out of the plastic. It stained the dress and was unsafe.,0
4,"Great gloves, but the 2 count is misleading. I always purchase gloves in pairs, so when i only received a right and a left glove i was kind of disappointed.",1
5,Meet expectations,1
1,"These were great looking. Very comfortable, lightweight and fit as expected.... Until it came time to wash them.<br /><br />All three pairs came completely apart in the wash.",0
3,They were two small but they were good quality shoes and really cute,0
1,"This hat arrived with a bent brim,loose stash and also has a faded mark on the side. It looks like it has been worn.<br />Spend your money elsewhere.",0
2,"Because if the way it folds, it doesn't hold much. After in card and some cash on the other side, you can hardly squeeze the thing together to keep it shut.",0
5,Perfect for the bracelets and necklaces I was making. About 5 of each style.,1
1,"If I cloud give it 0 stars I would, it worked once then broke.",0
1,Broke within a day,0
5,Extremely light weight.,1
5,"Super cute, fits great!! I'm 5&quot;3 ... 165 pounds ordered a large...",1
1,"I can't even rate the fit, as this item arrived REEKING of cigarette smoke. I'm so disappointed. I will be returning it.",0
4,The bottoms are very small and the top I would have gotten a size bigger. It is slightly tight.,1
5,"This mask is way too fun!! And yes, you can see through it, through the open mouth part.",1
4,OK,1
5,Got lots of compliments from friends at thanksgiving!,1
2,"About 3 sized to small.  I ordered an extra large and it's way to small,  I'm 5'6&#34; and 175.",0
1,"So disappointed! Ring cheaply made, most of the black paint off.",0
5,It served it purpose,1
4,"I love these earrings, this is my second pair. The only bad thing is the push backs slide off easily so I lost one my first pair. Make sure to find a secure back for your earrings.",1
5,Awesome,1
2,"This scarf is soft, but the thread gets easily caught (especially on velcro) & pulls out of the fabric.  Already ruined after a few short uses.",0
1,The logo put on this hat looks like a child's art project. Everyone I show laughs. It looks ridiculous.,0
2,Case and interior came separated from each other. I was in a pinch so I had to glue it and clamp it until I could replace it.,0
5,I was very pleased with my order,1
2,"I probably made the mistake of not zooming in on the photo from a laptop or desktop computer. I ordered this off my phone. I thought it would be see through gun metal colored glass beads on black. Because the color I ordered just says black #2.  Not black & silver. These are very cheap plastic solid bright silver beads. The kind you get off Hollywood blvd in a stripper store. So it lacks weight & quality. It's just ok, not nice enough for evening wear.",0
3,Cute but packed very cheap,0
1,"Bought as a gift for my dad and they are uncomfortable, hard to put in and too costly for the low quality also kinda heavy for studs.",0
3,They are bit smaller than others. At least get one size bigger than used too. Washed once and allready got holes. But they sure are soft,0
5,My gf really loved the shirt.,1
3,Decent quality but sizing is off. I’m 6’3” and the length was decent. They came down about mid knee. I typically where a 34 but bought these in a 36 after reading reviews. I should have probably bought a 38.,0
5,I’ve always been to ehhh about buying cloths on line but I saw a tiktok video on this dress and decided to purchase it hugs all the right places will definitely order another one,1
5,Great idea has saved me $$$ bought 4. 0ne for myself and others for fellow casino addics however mine came with a different key design than the others it has a round cutout on top key and will not open my bank.  The keys  for the others have a design logo in the center of turnkey and those will open all banks even mine/  When I told them I received no response would gladly pay the $2.50 for new keys but how do I know they will fit. Though they probably will be the same as the 3 others I gave as gifts.  Oh and yes I got the money out of my bank but had to use one of their keys. YOU CAN'T BREAK INTO THESE BANKS which is the KEY We live in Vegas and need all the help we can get as we try to beat those video poker machines This idea works great.,1
5,Used for a girls weekend.,1
5,This is VERY pretty.  The fabric is so soft and is high quality.  Pairs great with jeans or a skirt.  LOVE it.  Thank you.,1
5,Bought for 18 month old. Very stylish! Very light. Overall great for kids just starting to walk or gaining confidence. no slips neither. Would recommmend. Just wish I could get them in more sizes. Would definitely buy again,1
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,1
5,"I love this shirt and it fit perfectly. It is very light and airy, but not see-through or revealing. I've gotten many compliments on it. The material is also very nice and did not seem cheaply made.",1
2,"Nice ""hoodie"".  But I ordered a cadet neck sweatshirt!  But I kept it despite that error because the hoodie is a great fit and looks and feels great when I am wearing it.  too bad.....won't trust them to get it right the next time so will look for another vendor.",0
5,Love,1
5,Fit perfect,1
5,They were a tiny big but I love them the socks are so cute and I have washed them and they still look as good as new they got to me quick so I like that too,1
3,Definitely on the looser side.,0
5,A very nice dress with major impact.  I wore this dress yesterday on my father in law's birthday party and received good compliments. It fits perfectly and the color complimented my skin tone. I felt very comfortable wearing this not just because of its fabulous style but also because of  the very comfortable to wear. I made the right choice.,1
3,"I really like the fit and how cute it is. HOWEVER, the fabric is REALLY thin. I tried to wear a dark bra and you could see it through the shirt- and it really wasn't tight. So I don't wear this shirt without a tank underneath. I don't recommend this unless you're willing  to wear an undershirt of some kind - if you are, then its a cute shirt.",0
5,The shoe trees are top quality at a good price.,1
1,Very poor quality.  Do not purchase.,0
5,Shirt was great it's a Christmas present for my niece I'm sure she is going to love it thanks,1
1,The dress was not the length it stated in the description. I wanted floor length and it was calf length.,0
5,"Love these compression leggings. They are my fav. Finally, a pocket that fits a larger cell phone! A five star product!",1
5,My husband was looking for something that would be more comfortable than his traditional wedding band. This ring works out very well for him and he is able to wear it to work with no issues.,1
1,Fabric was cheap and super wrinkled. Not at all as they make it seem.,0
4,"Order came promptly and was everything I expected.  Dress fits well, fabric good quality.",1
4,"Yes even though I'm overweight I love this dress and it is flattering, have received compliments on it.",1
2,"Not quite the quality I expected for the price. Seems like it should be selling for about $12. The top is hard and the cooling band is nothing more than a strip of material around the brim. The top is very hard and not soft around your head at all. Feels like you are wearing one of those cheap straw hats. The brim also flops over both directions without your effort and can look absolutely stupid if it flops down and you don't notice it. For $39, not very good.",0
5,Looks great I love it.,1
4,"Received 2 last week.  As soon as my wife saw it she noticed it had no hem where the material has been cut and wondered if it will begin to fray.  I used one on a 2 day backpacking trip on the AT over the weekend.  Worked well.  I wore it do-rag style to keep bugs off my head, shield the back of my neck from sunburn, and of course to soak up sweat.  This bandana is long enough that when I stopped for a rest I could flip the dry end around.  It dries very quickly, so by the next stop I'd flip it again.  The cut ends didn't fray even after washing, but do roll over (curl?).  I only gave 4 stars because of the potential fraying question, but perhaps it's a non issue.  Time will tell.  For 8 bucks, I can't really complain.<br /><br />Update:  Our fourth purchase.  Our granddaughters use them now as well.  No fraying of cut ends of fabric at this point.  Treated with permethrin a couple of weeks ago, so far all is good.  Druthers would be to have pattern/colors inside and out.  Will likely buy again.",1
1,This mask was made for a woman or child. This mask was not made for an American male.,0
3,To small returned them,0
4,It’s just fine,1
5,"LOVE this swimsuit! It's very comfortable, but still form fitting, and of high quality materials. The cups are definitely for larger sizes, and probably would not fit cup sizes below C without some gap. I also don't know if I'd call it a &#34;push up&#34; top, but it is lined,  and with an underwrite. It also comes with a nice little beach bag. Very satisfied with this purchase!",1
3,Nice shirt but fits tight in arms and shoulders. Runs on small side and i even went up a size due to reviews,0
3,"Material is soft, but gets out of shape after first wash. Also the color fades quickly.  Balance between price and quality is not fair - should be much cheaper.",0
5,"I love these shirts, as does my 4-yr old",1
5,Exactly as described,1
4,"***Update from 5 stars to 4*** There are tiny little white fuzzes on the dress that wont come off. I'm still going to wear it and it is still cute, but it doesn't look that great.<br /><br />Seriously so cute. I got a large and it fits great. I'm 5'6 and it falls maybe 2 inches above my knee. I'm about 165 lbs and carry most of my weight in my hips and butt. Material is soft and comfortable. I'm wearing it at work with a little black cardigan over it. When I leave work I'll take the cardigan off and it will be the perfect summer dress!",1
4,"Gift for niece & new husband, haven’t heard of any issues.",1
4,Patriotic shirt for the holidays - faded just right.,1
5,I purchased this shirt for my sister who adopted two boys (brothers) and got pregnant with another baby all at the same time. She became a mom x3 all at once and couldn't have been more happy about it. She loved this shirt so much she cried. I fit was perfect and the material was so soft. I highly recommend this one!,1
5,This is just as described! It is very good quality and I love the color! I may have to order more. I ordered the kimono Sunday and received it Monday!,1
5,Very nice,1
5,"This is actually my 2nd cardigan Ive bought from here..... I now own this cardigan in black and blue.  Its made out of a nice material so it looks great with my office work clothes.  Fits perfectly for me.  If I ever need another color, I will buy from here again and again.",1
3,"These gloves fit my 5 yo's hands, but probably not for long. Not too much stretch however they will do their job this year as he is averaging one lost glove a week.",0
4,"The dress is made of a cheaper material, which I expected so that's fine. BUT I am super short so this went past my knees and looked really weird on me.",1
3,Screws on right side always come loose and finally fall out but what do you expect for $3.33?,0
2,"I love crinkle dresses, and this one is a nice color, but it's cut weirdly (the front is short, too abruptly compared to back (at least for me). Main problem is that the back seam tore after three washings. (in cold water, no drier, gentle cycle)",0
3,Thought the necklace should be longer..love the earrings,0
5,Nice! Real comfy.,1
1,Too small... not much larger than a quarter.,0
5,"shipped fast and fits great. Im 5'10&#34; 235lbs so on the husky side, and this robe fits great.  While standing it almost reaches my ankles about 2 inches off, and can close completely with a little left in the belt for tieing so maybe if you were 10 lbs heavier/fatter for hieght it may just fit you",1
5,My granddaughter loved it and the one for her doll. It fit well. Is very soft. I have it to her for Valentine’s Day. I’m going to buy another one for my other granddaughter.,1
5,Loved this dress ! Very elegant and fit perfect ! I wore it to my Babyshower & it was comfortable as well !,1
5,"Yes, it was a good product for a good price. I wish they still offered it in the clear plastic though",1
5,"Perfecto, todo correctamente con la imagen, muy bellos.",1
3,It fit beautifully and is very flattering on BUT as the picture shows one ruffle is slightly smaller than the other and starts slightly higher than the other. The material is also on the cheap side. I'm keeping it though because I do like the look and no one in my family noticed the ruffle flaw until I pointed it out.,0
2,The quality was less than expected.  My son has only worn it a few times and it already has a hole in it!,0
5,"I’ve been buying Hanna Andersson since 1994 & most of the things are either still here or have been passed on & used by other kids!<br />Same will go for these moccasins - they will last.<br />They’re soft, they’re smooth, & they’re sewn to last. I love the gray as a neutral for all. The sock portion is thick, mostly cotton with a soft ribbed cuff & the gray leather sole is smooth & flexible. When a child’s bare foot goes in, it will touch nothing but soft & smooth. Perfect.<br />I will wash in cold while inside a net bag & air dry - instructions say you can wash in warm, too.<br />Great slippers to gift or get for your own kiddos!<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this review & hope it’s been Helpful!)",1
1,Runs really big..,0
5,They're hilarious!!! Perfect for police costume. I also bought the police hat with the pig ears hanging out! Definitely got a lot of laughs!!,1
5,I love this embroidered blouse. I wish this company would make other styles!,1
5,Great fit for my 14 year old daughter. She wears size 7 women's.  Good quality!,1
1,They look dingy and cheap,0
2,Rough edges,0
1,They broke on 5 minutes of having them.,0
5, ,1
2,"Meh, not what I was hoping for during my night drives",0
5,"I love this hat. Its thick, and warm, and has a liner in it, and its in my favorite outdoors color. Its also a pretty good size and fits even my big head really well, which is a issue with a lot of these kinds of hats when I try to cover my ears. I REALLY like it. Planning to order 3-4 more of these next payday, as I learned long ago, when you find something you really like, you better stock up because it will likely disappear soon. plus hats and gloves are always easily lost anyway. I love this hat.",1
4,Super cute. Not too thin and not too thick. Only complaint is that I got 2 blacks instead of 1 black and 1 red.,1
2,"The dangles are poorly made and are very stiff.  while trying to adjust, one of the stones fell out.  Super glued it back in and still wore them.  They look nice though.  (I had a matching necklace)",0
5,Great hat,1
5,[[VIDEOID:a8fdae5237fc9a11672289f5b84503e1]] Love this cardigan. It's really comfy soft and cute. It fits well and I was surprised that the size fit over sized for me. Happy with purchase.,1
4,This jersey is such high quality for the money and came just as described. The sizing chart was spot on. It was a birthday gift for a friend however I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great well-made jersey,1
3,My husband liked the shirt after ordering the dad shirt twice and it arriving saying grandpa. Had to give it to my dad because my husband is most definitely not a grandpa. Second time ordering the same product it finally said dad.,0
5,Beautiful belt.  A little pricey.,1
5,Super comfortable. Cute design. Love the shirt!!,1
2,It fits me much longer than pictured. It goes under my calves and I'm 5'4&#34;.  The material is very itchy too.,0
3,"Coat was very beautiful, style and color but the size chart is too misleading I think because I ordered the size I wear and it was too snug especially in the area.",0
4,nice quality soft.,1
5,Love these earrings they are cute<br />Would recommend these to anyone who loves things that are<br />Different no matter if there big or smile earrings,1
2,I really want to love this band. It is so pretty and would be absolutely perfect except the band does not want to stay connected to the Fitbit. It disconnects every time I try to take the watch off my wrist. Maybe it was a one off but I wouldn’t buy again to replace.,0
3,I already reviewed this product.  Maybe it was not received.  I washed and dried the hankies on delicate cycle.  They shrunk about 1 inch around.  I was quite disappointed about that.  I have not used them yet though.,0
5,I love the way this top fits,1
1,"Came in bubble mailer,  Lenses were popped out.  Huge pain to get back in and they continue to pop out. Spent more time fixing them than I did wearing them.  Need better packaging",0
5,Love this watch. It attaches to my name badge. Easy to read.,1
4,What I expect them to be,1
5,It looks so cool. The ol lady loved it.,1
4,"Love the top. You could wear it like a dress, or like me and wear it as a top, with leggings or skinny jeans. Only thing I’m a little disappointed with is very wrinkled after wash.",1
1,"I got these as a Christmas gift & I was super excited because they're so cute. I wore them for the first time for a few hours and when I got home, BOTH buttons were off & nowhere to be found. What a waste.",0
4,Nice material. Could be a little longer. Wash nice.,1
4,liked,1
4,Super cute and stays on. One thing I have noticed is with extended amounts of time wearing the cap the pressure of the elastic starts to hurt my ears.,1
5,Perfect for my daughters costume. The fit is accurate to the size chart.,1
5,"Very comfortable, wore it all day at Renfest, goth prom, and some photo shoots.",1
1,It was broken when I received it. Not even worth the wait and return just gonna throw it,0
5,The shirt fit great and I wore it to the movies to see Captain Marvel. Its was awesome and the shirts delivered on time!,1
5,"Got this for a gift for a friend, after I ironed them they looked GREAT",1
2,"Strange, foamy material. Definitely not fleece. Sized a bit small.",0
2,This shirt literally makes noise because of the image.  I don’t think it’ll withstand being washed so will be returning.  The image itself is nice though.,0
3,"As a watch it's fine, and it does have a unique appearance.  As an E6B it's pointless as the numbers and graduations are too small to effectively use, and a dive-watch style time external bezel would be much more useful than an &#34;hour hand sun rule&#34; compass bezel.  The minute hand is massive and I have mixed feelings on it; it's actually quite helpful in a cockpit environment because more than any other watch I have worn I can glance out of the corner of my eye and have a high confidence of what 5 minute block of minutes I'm in, but it also means that there is about a 20 minute period every hour when the minute hand blocks enough of the digital display for it to not be at all useful.",0
5,This was purchased for my wife and she loves it.Servie was also excellent.,1
4,It's unique but the chain is very delicate!,1
3,"There is only one size, and yes it probably will fit all, but maybe a bit more difficult for some. Also, there is no design to help ventilate the moisture from breathing, not around the nose/mouth area, only two vents at each side on the cheek. I wear glasses and this is a fog maker to my glasses. Also it is pretty thin too, but certainly will help to keep your face warm. I actually prefer another balaclava made by Chaos.",0
1,I'm 5'8&#34; tall so it's hard to find dresses that are long enough for me.  That being said this dress was unwearable.  Width wise it fit me but the &#34;waist line&#34; was half way between my bust and my navel.  The pockets were in line with my navel.  It was awkwardly short & I had to return it.,0
5,"This is actually a beautiful sweater but I'm not very crazy about it on me. Its just a tad too long. The material is very lightweight. Perhaps if it was a bit heavier it would hang a little nicer on the body. Just my opinion, altho I think I shrunk in height!! But I absolutely loved that it has a hood!!",1
5,pretty bag for the price. excellent...,1
3,"Sound quality is good, battery life is now that good. Fits a little on the tight side.",0
3,The earrings fell off the backings. They look better online.,0
5,"Awesome night driving glasses,",1
2,Very flexible but way too small!ordered a 4.5 and it's smaller than a size 3!?!fits without socks but um....I'm not doing that.,0
3,SMALL,0
2,"Muy bonito, pero llego mojado y con mal olor.",0
2,"The band the luminox watch came with broke 3 times. Each time I replaced it with the original band. Finally, I decided to upgrade to this great looking and extremely comfortable band. However, the pins have fallen out 3 times and now I am out of pins from the links I removed to make it fit. Unbelievable, I am relatively hard on this watch but not SEAL hard. I do not recommend this band.",0
4,It has a nice thick large hood and is comfortable. The hood actually covers my whole head and doesn't just cover like half or 3/4 of my head. Not crazy about the elastic waist riding up above my belt sometimes and then having to adjust it back down but not a big deal. I still like it.,1
1,pink dress was much darker than as shown on website.  returned.  company would not pay for return.,0
5,"I legit would pay $25 for these. I lose and break sunglasses alot and I was more upset doe these than i was when I ignorantly spent $200 on some Oakley's and lost them. They're great for blocking sun, you can wear them inside (if you're &#34;that guy&#34;) or at night and still see great. They're comfortable, stylish, and cheap. Just for comparison I showed my wife the clearance rack at Walmart and a case like these come in was on clearance for 4.88, not including comfy stylish sun blocking shades.",1
5,Love this product.  Very high quality.,1
1,Was advertised as 4mm and when measured with a micrometer was on 2mm. There were 2 broken gemstones that were broken off and floating around the package. This was a Christmas gift so there is no point in returning. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. I would look at other sellers on Amazon before buying a cheaper replica for a younger person or yourself getting started into belt collecting,0
3,"This was smaller than I thought it would be. It’s not real, I don’t think. But it’s still pretty. The chain is so cheap looking. That’s the main reason I don’t wear it much.",0
5,Good,1
2,To small. I ordered size 9 but didn’t fitted,0
3,"Size wayyyyyyy down. Quality is good, it's very cute, but this is beyond over sized. I am normally a M/L in tops, and I probably could have worn an extra small. I had to tighten the straps as far as they would go to keep it from falling off me. That said, I think I can still make it work and it's good quality for the price.",0
5,Solid wallet!!,1
5,great coverage,1
1,Did not fit as expected.  Ended up giving to my youngest daughter.  The cup was smaller than expected even though I've been wearing this size fit 20+ years,0
3,"The fit is perfect, the material sucks and it's see through when dry, let alone wet.",0
1,"Very cheap, break and fall apart.",0
5,"Bought these for my toddler's first concert and couldn't be more pleased with the quality and performance. They fit him perfectly (he's 2) but somehow I was even able to get them on my head, so clearly these are going to last us a while. Also love the carrying case they come with - it's a little mini backpack that my son was able to carry with him for the walk up to the concert area.",1
5,Fly ass watch! The colors pop and the band is comfortable. The best part is that it's relatively cheap so if you thrash it you won't feel bad.,1
1,"The length is great and the jeans material is fine. The front pockets are at a rather flat angle making it difficult to put your hands in the pockets. And the button and zipper feel like dollar store grade tin that will be breaking soon. Definitely NOT worth $30, maybe worth $10 at a discount clothes store. I'm keeping them for the length and to use as a pattern, but will never buy again.",0
5,"This is actually fairly well made and looks to be durable.  My issue with it is the ""quick release"" which I found to be irritating my wrist.  It protrudes slightly from the back and over time becomes an irritant.  You can using a pliers remove it but then you might have trouble if the band ever needs to be replaced.  I might be overly sensitive to this but I've had other quick release bands and not had this issue.<br />June 2022 update:  The band has held up very well with no degradation.  I wear it every day and even occasionally get it wet so very pleased with it.  I solved the ""quick release"" issue by removing the pins and replacing them with a standard set of pins which is actually easy to do and the pins are cheap.  So overall I strongly recommend this band",1
2,I don’t think this tunic is flattering at all. I do like the color and feel of the material. I bought my usual size but don’t think sizing up or down would help. Very disappointed.,0
4,like it...cute,1
5,Great watch band! My boyfriend loves it.,1
5,Love this dress!!! I'm about 5'3 and 140. I ordered a medium. Fits perfect. I got a lot of complements on the dress,1
1,"I ordered one pair and they were pretty, so I ordered several more pairs for backup. The ones received were big and gaudy and ompletely unreal looking. I contacted this seller, only to get no reply on their behalf. Unfortunately, I guess if you luck out and get what you order, you will be pleased, if not, it's simply too bad.",0
5,If you want to extend your scooter riding season this will help,1
3,No me encantan el cierre es inseguro y se pueden perder con facilidad,0
5,Awesome purchase.,1
2,"It fits big! I am 5’3” & about 120lbs, it was too big but great material & stretch! Great quality, just runs big!",0
4,They’re really cute shorts! My only problem with them is the tan ones are pretty see through,1
5,This works Great.<br /> Thank You,1
2,"Cool shirt, but had 2 holes, which looked like punctures through the front, and back. Probably won't wear, but i liked the design.",0
5,"Saw previous reviews that complained about install issues. It was super easy, love it and use on a daily basis.",1
2,"Smaller than expected, thin and flimsy. Doesn't have a flat bottom to stand up.",0
1,Turns green quickly and makes your nose itch!,0
1,Was broke when I got it,0
1,Runs small,0
5,Bought two for Christmas gifts.  They were pleased with them,1
5,"My daughter loves her shoes, the battery lasts for a long time",1
1,Se pone un color prieto feo,0
3,The wave caps are too big,0
3,Like the jacket but the sizes are way off,0
1,Hola el gorro a mi hija me quedó súper pequeño! Ella tiene 5 años y no me sirvió! Necesito que me envíen un gorro más grande porque si no la compra no sirvió!,0
5,People were not lying when they said these are huge. They hang to my shoulders and are kind of heavy. I love them though and they're really beautiful.,1
5,Very good quality,1
5,Love it and the words written,1
5,Big size,1
5,Nothing,1
5,"Awesome product, fast shipping",1
3,These are soft and cozy.  They do run a bit small and they shrink when washed so buy one size up.,0
4,"Looks good, plenty of room.  Would prefer that the inside lining was not loose.  Worked well for an extended trip.",1
5,"super comfortable, great price!",1
1,"Definitely junk, batteries are infact glued to the back no way to turn them on. Waste of money. My four year old dughter is upset.",0
5,Bought this for my 14 year old son. He loves it!,1
2,"Size M, I am a pear, around 5’6” 140. Did not fit well, overall it was large. Waist is high and loose. Did nothing for my figure. Sleeves hit right below elbow, could have been an inch or do longer. I think this would fit better on someone with more curves.",0
5,Very compfy. Looks great on my fossil diver watch.,1
5,This is absolutely beautiful and the quality is amazing! I love it! It is also adjustable.,1
3,"Earrings are very pretty and are I love the colors. However...having shoulder length hair, the earrings stick to my hair and must be pulled away.",0
3,Gold plating wears off rather quickly.,0
5,"Fits well.  Material is soft.  I got a large because chest is big but otherwise I am petite, so I would suggest going up in a size if you aren't sure.  Great for nursing moms too!",1
3,"Love the heart earring and picture, but wish it hung down a little farther.  Mine don't have the round ring shown on these and it makes them hit the ear instead of dangling.",0
5,Lovely dress.  Very comfortable,1
5,Fabric is nice and soft,1
1,"Doesn’t even look like same product. Bought a large and it was tiny like an xtra small. Probably will never buy lingerie online ever again, less stress just going to the store.",0
5,Very nice material,1
3,"These slippers are very soft and the colors are very pretty. Unfortunately, the elastic around the opening is very loose, and they keep sliding off my feet.  🦶",0
3,Not a great wear and the Cat sliced it up one day.,0
5,Very nice,1
2,"These are too short!  I really like the stretchyness and comfort of the fabric, but the length is too short.  I will be returning them.",0
3,"I love pajama jeans but my last order was for medium size. After a few washes, I cannot even get in them anymore. But one pair of medium did fit and continues to fit but now snug.  So I ordered a large and the large is HUGE.  I washed them hoping they would shrink like the others and fit, but no, they are still way too big. The sizes of pajama jeans are inconsistent and I give up on getting the correct sizing.",0
3,I am 5'8 and this thing was all up in my backside. It was big in the front but somehow it was short and I was in a XXL. Just absolutely not worth $99.00. My wife got the same one (but for women) and that one felt WAY WAY better. This just feels like fake used material they got off the corner.,0
5,Fit very well and was great for my saber alter casual day!,1
1,"This was the worst fitting bathing suit ever purchased. I had it hemmed and even professionals couldn't fix it. If I sized down or up, would have been worse. The fabric isn't flattering, I cant get a refund after hemming it and I plan to cut it up as a reminder to not trust reviews & descriptions with less than 100 verified purchases. So ugly in every way & I don't usually complain about Amazon bought bathsuits. Guess I've lucked out until now.",0
1,Item is nomore that 3 months old and it already faded not happy with item at all,0
2,"These are nice but they break very easily, my sister broke a few just trying to open them up.",0
2,Very see through material.,0
2,These look great but are sized for and adult.,0
1,"I bought these shoes for my son (3 different colors) and they were all super wide, the size was about 2 sizes too big<br />And the Velcro fell off the strap within 3 weeks!  The quality was awful!",0
2,"I was thinking that it would be similar to other necklace that I bought to this distribuitor, but this particular necklace looks so cheaper... I dont like at all",0
5,"Ordered these for the hubs for the gym and he loves them! Great fit. He’s muscular build, big shoulders and arms, smaller waist.  He prefers longer gym shirts (below the belt but not a dress). Very attractive fit! And great quality. Highly recommend",1
5,"This dress is super comfortable, and falls at just the right length.  I wear about 2.5in heels with them and the length is perfect (I'm 5 ft 3in).",1
5,Lovely earrings!,1
1,I don't like it at all,0
4,Warm socks and soft!,1
2,Too big for me,0
3,I ordered the white and black combo tank. The black tank was perfect. The material is nice and soft and stretchy and I read alot of comments about it being short. I have a short torso and the shirt went down to the side of my hip. The reason why I'm not giving this a 5 star is because the white tank came with a huge stain.  The stain is a perfect rectangle on how the shirt was folded in the packaging. I tried to bleach it but it's still yellow in the middle. I was disappointed because I really liked the black tank top.,0
5,Excellent quality and perfect size for little purses.,1
4,"Really like these. At first I thought they might be too tall (they project outward quite a bit), but I think this makes them easier to see and gives them a certain style. They are very modern looking with the bezel setting and the way the stones are encased in metal. Definitely a presence on the ear. I changed out the backs to silicone disc backs, which do a great job of keeping the studs upright and tight against my ear. Love having the ability to change out the colors! This is a huge selling point. You must take care not to lose the little stones when you're not wearing them and keep them from scratching against each other (take them out of the bag and store them some other way). Overall very happy and would recommend these.",1
2,It will be given away to someone with a waist half that of mine. No way could it sit on my hips as in the picture. Pity because it is so nice and soft.,0
4,Nice statement piece,1
1,I didn’t receive the center - it has pockets around the interior and 2 pockets on the exterior - in the center there is 2 sewn in Velcro strips but no insert came with it-,0
5,Love these,1
1,"Useless product, but fast service",0
3,order a size up....thin material overall sexy though,0
3,3 star due to chain does not fit on the hello kitty pendant. I have to use some pliers on the chain to make it fit to hold it.<br />If chain was properly size or pendant I will have give 5 stars.,0
5,Equicore band system,1
1,"The metal for the stud part of the earring is soft and bent the second time I wore them.  When I bent it back to make it straight again, it broke off completely.  I wore the earrings maybe 3 times.  Not worth your money.",0
2,"I really like these socks.  I have at least 5 pair but I am disappointed in that they all wear out in the heal fairly quickly.  I haven't had the socks more than 6 months and they all have holes in the heals.  I wear these socks all the time because they give nice support to my legs and allow me to be active without my legs aching.  Maybe all compression socks ware out quickly. I don't have others to compare to. If anyone at the company reads these, I would love it if they can make the bottom of the socks thicker or more durable, especially under the heal.",0
5,"Worked perfectly, Exactly as described.",1
1,"The suitcase was missing a latch and I ended up not having this for my daughter on her trip.  Maybe just bad luck, but not good for me.",0
5,very nice look,1
5,Stylish and perfect size.,1
1,"I bought this dress for my granddaughter. It was darling. When she was trying it on, the sleeve fell off. I returned it & decided not to re-order.",0
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS, it is made very cheaply, AND they sent me gold instead of silver.... REALLY!!!!!!",0
1,Bag didn’t even last a month. Poorly constructed. Handle came apart,0
5,"These are my favorite pj’s. They are soft, stretchy and lightweight. The only downside is that the inside of the material pills after some wear, but even with that I still plan on purchasing more of these due to their comfort and style.",1
5,nice looking,1
5,They are tarnishing.,1
1,"This extremely thin cotton crop top is not worth the price! Better quality at Forever21 or Walmart for way cheaper can be found for such little, cheap material.",0
5,"True to logo, great quality t shirt. Was as expected. Great buy!",1
2,"Runs very small, ordered a medium which is the size I alway wear and I couldn’t even snap this closed",0
5,Great boots!! Very comfy and pretty!! Fits perfectly as expected. I usually get a UK7 and was advised to go up a size for the fabric boots as they do not stretch. Correct!! They fit perfectly!!,1
1,"First time I put this bracelet on it broke, it fellow my wrist and lost it. Quality is poor. I wrote seller and asked that he send me another since the first had poor quality. no return response",0
3,I ordered the white color and it was very see-through. I had to return it.,0
1,"Fit was awful. Very tight elastic in the waist and the cuffs on the knee area fit like it was made for a toddler. Very poor workmanship. I ended up throwing them out. DO NOT PURCHASE, you will be extremely disappointed.",0
5,Adorable and fun to wear,1
5,"I like  this  product because it is earth<br />Friendly, anservice by  it cleans verry good!.",1
4,The dress is super cute but the fabric is delicate the holes at the bottom are fine but if it gets stuck in something it will probably be stretched out.,1
2,For me the quality of the print was off. I hated the feel of the clothing themself as well. It felt like it would get hot and uncomfortable to play in. I would tell anyone to pass on this. I returned. I wanted to like it because my son loves godzilla but nope. Fit was as expected.,0
1,See through!,0
3,"One side is great but the back is just the print backwards. Fine for hanging on a wall, not so great for hanging off a pole from our house where each side will be visible. Otherwise the colors are vibrant and text is easy to read.",0
5,Loved the ‘50’s look.,1
5,Great sunglasses. They fit well and look great. I recieved this product at a discount for an honest review.,1
3,Cute but fits much larger than expected 😔,0
3,I'm 5' 7&#34; and 150 lbs. Had to return the dress- it was just way too short on me. Fit everywhere else perfectly but the length made me return it.,0
1,The 3rd time I put them on the left lense fell out. I tried but couldn't put it back in. I am sending it back.,0
4,"A little bit small, but beautiful fabric",1
5,"Purchased these for our daughter as her feet are always cold during online school. She wears them nearly every morning and says they are comfy and warm. Look more like a mouse to us than a rabbit, but still super cute! Fit as expected.",1
3,"Fit slightly awkward, when I smile they raise up off my face. Also one of the lenses doesn't seem to be seated properly in the frame.",0
5,"I purchased this for my 6 month old baby, as he has a larger head and it fit perfect! The inside is warm for baby’s head and I love the little bear design! So cute and cozy for my baby boy!",1
5,It's beautiful and looks like it costs hundreds of dollars. Very good quality. My niece is obsessed with spiders and I think this is now one of her most prized possessions.,1
4,"Cute but returned. I have a large bust and the extra ruffles were a little much. Also the cut on the leg was not very flattering. Not quite boyshort, not really regular cut.",1
3,true to size. polyester material,0
1,China size,0
5,These are awesome.  Used the other day on the golf course...No bulky earmuffs....and very comfortable.  Also bought my husband a pair as well.,1
5,"It’s a nice item , but if you have chubby fingers , the snap won’t fit , but other than that , it’s all Great!!!",1
1,"I waited forever for these pants, they do NOT look like the picture.  I am very nicely shaped (I'm a Marine) but these pants did not fit me at all and I got the biggest size seeing as it was coming from Asia.  It was a total waste of money.  The material was cheap and the so called chains were gold plastic that broke or got caught on the shreds of the pants.",0
5,"The shawl was nicer than I expected.  It is long enough to drape and tie, and it  has lovely sequins on it.  It is a winner!",1
1,Nice quality jacket but runs small. Sits above waist and sleeves are too short. Also disappointed with return policy. Way too short of a turn around time and expensive restocking fee. I figure by the time I pay for shipping twice plus a restocking fee I’m out $30. Bummer :(,0
4,"Adorable and soft, fits large (0-3 months fits more like 6 months) but cute overall. Will be fine as a costume if it's cold out its sure to keep my 2 month old warm.",1
5,I absolutely love everything about the stress. I got so many compliments on it. I will most definitely be ordering the same dress in a different style,1
5,Medium fit me great. I’m 5’3” 160 lbs. the skirt part began right below bust and swept to just above floor. I haven’t laundered yet. Will update if doesn’t go well but I fully expect it to. Lots of compliments!  Looking to buy in at least one more color!,1
5,TOP quality on the inside is very cool too. my sons wedding ring he love it!,1
1,Size cart way off,0
4,Demasiado caliente,1
4,"I was hesitant to pay twelve dollars for them, but they are pretty comfy. I have not washed them yet, but will see how they hold up.",1
4,"Overall, a good belt for the money, but at 1-7/8"" wide, the buckle is too large to fit through the belt loops of Carhartt B01 work trousers. To wear the belt, I have to remove the buckle, put on the belt, put the buckle back on, and adjust for length.",1
3,Really nice mask for my intended purpose but for some reason it wouldn’t stay on my ears and I ended up losing it! Couldn't even represent on my way back home.,0
5,Came within reasonable time. Unpacked and assembled without any problems what so ever.  Let it set in sunlight for couple days to charge lights as instructed. Third day went our after dark and turned on lights and was very pleased. I did not realize that there was an additional light around the pole at the top. That was a nice surprise and made me happy about the purchase. Will definitely check with Flame & Shade on future needs.,1
5,got my son this set for winter! super cute and cozy!,1
1,The material was not as expected. You definitely get what you pay for but for me it was a  it underwhelming and I ended up returning it. Keep in mind it only has one layer of material and it has a weird texture to it. The color [tan] looked muddy and dull.,0
5,"I actually got this because I got a new QALO tag, but the ring included was so pathetic that our Mini Schnauzer tore it up during play.<br /><br />This turned out to be the answer! Fits the QALO tag perfectly, has held up to being chewed, knocked around and scratched, and is SO easy to get on and off compared to regular rings. I just placed an order for another one so that I can use it for more things!",1
5,"Pretty, and lasts long.",1
5,This vest is far more than I expected! The Harley patch on the back is beautiful. Wonderful quality!<br />I’m so happy with my gorgeous vest!,1
5,It was so cute!,1
5,Much needed,1
3,Will not stay up in my shoes!!!,0
1,Shipping was FAST ordered Friday got my package Monday but dress runs huge I hate it don't recommend to buy,0
5,Beautiful quality! Light weight and nice detail! Great for the price!!,1
5,"The belt was shipped quickly, and with standard USPS delivery was at my door in less than a week.  The leather is thick and in great condition.  The belt is very well made.  Not made for skinny guys, it is large and I will have to cut some new holes, which will be tricky on such thick leather and with the duel buckle fasteners..  Overall a great looking, quality belt.",1
3,The joggers were slightly too big length wise for me but that’s pretty normal as I’m 5 ft exactly. My only problem is after the first wear the material started to clump up from my thighs rubbing against each other.,0
2,"Sending back. I got a pair of crawlers on Etsy a couple years ago and it was perfect. Had no issues with them falling or looking crooked. Unfortunately, this pair I just received won't hold in place. Feels flimsy too.",0
3,Would be a 5 star but one of the snap buttons fell off rather soon.,0
5,"Looks like a skull but is not. It just has holes but very sexy, could be a little longer, cause i wanted to wear with leggings. I ordered an xl and wanted the off the shoulder look, but if your smaller i would order a size larger so that you get that look like the model",1
1,Very pretty but the red is all chipped,0
4,was dusty when it came. but wiped it down with a dry cloth and it was fine,1
5,very nice,1
5,"This thing is horrible. See the girl in the photo? Ya, well if you have her shape you WILL not fit.<br /> If you are 12 and your mom lets you dress a bit risque.....its for you.",1
5,Love em! Great socks,1
5,"I got these for my daughter, who recently got her ears pierced. They are so cute and nice quality.",1
5,these leggings fit and feel great I am 5&#34;6 and170lb they are length was great .The shipping was fast also VERY GLAD I PURCHASE THESE,1
5,Love the look!  Comfortable and light weight!,1
1,Cute style but way too small. Even ordered a size larger... Chinese size chart incorrect.  Returned.,0
1,Too small,0
1,Cheap quality. I should have returned it,0
3,It was a gift. The person receiving was happy.,0
1,"Terrible quality shirt.. not sure what these other reviews are talking about, because the shirt quality and make is awful. Sew lines/seams are not straight, where it’s sewn at the buttons are loose and felt like the buttons were going to fall off when unbuttoned. Fabric quality is also super stiff and low quality. Absolutely will not be buying anymore from this seller. Disappointed. Returning for refund immediately!",0
3,"Cute sweater, but definitely size up if you want the sweater to look like picture of the model wearing it. The sleeves are not that long, more like 3/4 sleeve.",0
2,Break easy,0
2,"Very comfortable.  Only one problem,  the right slipper was obviously used because their was a stain and scuff on the toe.  Returned for a refund.",0
1,"Always love the look of this dress so I ordered it! Surprised by the sizing, most of all. It fits funny in the waist, almost small but tolerable, and despite my large bust the top is huge and has no support, straps or elastic. Disappointed by the size proportioning!!",0
4,Me gusto mucho se ve muy lindo ya en tu muñeca,1
3,I am 5’3 and 117lbs.  I ordered the x-small bc they said it was comparable to a size 4. The waist way a tad tight but I assume after wearing for little bit would loosen up. Quality of the fabric was awesome. Very well made.  BUT they were So long.  They were about 4 inches past my ankle so they went all the way to the arch of my foot.,0
5,Perfect watch band makes my watch stand out so much,1
1,"Cute for a photo but the “buttons” are glued on. One of them came off. Considering it’s specially meant for babies, this became a toxic choking hazard. Could have been stitched on instead to make it safer.",0
5,My wife loves it. Warm and cozy. Doesn’t run big like other review said. My wife is 5’3 120 DD cup and a small fits perfect,1
5,My husband has lymphedema and has been in and out of therapy for the last two or three years.  The therapists ordered compression socks for him but those didn't fit well.  We tried several other brands and Zeta was the best choice of them all.,1
3,I returned the boots. Sorry,0
5,Very pretty,1
5,Love this dress- prefect for Church or work. I want one in every color!,1
2,"This fit fine but was by no means high waisted.  It came just above my hips, provided zero coverage for the tummy.",0
5,This blouse is one of the most prettiest blouses I have ever bought...I would highly recommend purchasing<br />blouse as it goes with everything...You won't regret it..!.,1
1,The pink on my set was not finished. To explain my item was not fully painted several spots where some of the paint had ran to collect and for a sharp point on the nose section that stabs me when worn. This are very cheaply made and are not worth the purchase.,0
1,You can hold these pants up and see right through them. Do not waste your money.,0
3,"[[VIDEOID:62576d267c27de53b2214e418ce8430c]] When I first opened the package I was a little taken back at how poor the fabric quality is. Maybe after the first wash it will soften up. The lining on the inside is white which makes it appear cheap as well, since the main color is black. The tie in the front has the same pattern on both sides so when you tie it it doesn’t show the white lining, which is a huge plus. I purchased the black w/skull & crossbones  size Medium for my flight on Halloween to Hawaii. If you plan to use this top for a specific Holiday then I would say sure. However 25 bucks is a bit steep.<br />For Reference: I’m 34B, 27in waist, 5’10, slim build.",0
4,"The collar doesn't seem to want to stay down which is why I gave it four stars. But the fit is actually perfect.  I'm 5'8&#34; and 215lbs and ordered the XL. I was worried it wouldn't fit well but it does.  The material is nice, much better than expected considering the price. It's blue and a soft t-shirt type of material.",1
2,"The idea is good but the fact that the stay is around your thigh it actually doesnt stay throughout the day.  The band will gradually ride up your leg until it's in your crotch.  Stick with the ones that attach to your socks.  Also one of the fasteners came broke, but I fixed it.  Just way too uncomfortable.",0
5,"Great quality, does not slip off. Beautiful addition to any outfit.",1
2,"These capris are huge, I could have worn a small in them? Nice material though. Sent them back.",0
5,Beautiful,1
1,"If I could give this no stars I would. I ordered this same clutch on ebay in red, black and light blue. Horrible, horrible clutches. I threw them away. I would be embarrassed to use them. Seriously, do not buy them.",0
1,See above.,0
1,I wish their was a separate review area for those receiving a knock-off product. I received a bag labeled Lovevook and is quite different than the one shown in the photos.,0
4,Light weight material. Love the three quarter sleeves. Print seems a little light but still good. If you want it baggy I recommend ordering a size up. Arrived two weeks early. And it’s just a fun shirt to wear.,1
1,Mad- i loved this but when it came in there was no clasp so i couldn't ever wear it...,0
4,"This bra is so soft, and so comfortable. I am not sure what took me so long to give this a try. Fits as expected, true to size. My advice on this product is to order more than 1!",1
3,It's pretty and all but they get stuck on my clothing easily. I've had them for about a week and one piece came off.,0
5,"Love it! Small but ample, it's a light bag so it doesn't hurt your shoulder.",1
5,Just right for me and who doesn't like you read that much,1
5,My 17 yr old son looks great in this shirt.,1
5,Roomy and super cute!,1
5,this is a good product and performed as expected.,1
5,Definitely winter sweats. Very comfortable though and fit well.,1
5,Fits well and looks adorable on my granddaughter,1
3,"The elastic broke on the first day of use with two out of the three that came in the package. I still used them and they did the trick, but I wished I could tighten them.",0
1,This product gets no stars from me! Zero! Poor quality and it did not fit. Don't buy it!,0
5,keeps bags from spilling on the car floor or in the car seat.  Very useful!,1
5,Very pretty.  Great design.,1
1,Could not get phone in was too small,0
4,My daughter goes to gymnastics in a place where they also sell leotards. This one is much nicer and unique and cost half of what they are charging there.  I'll be looking for more from this seller.,1
5,Homeyee is the best! This dress fit like a charm :),1
5,"Ordered two sizes up based on product reviews (ordered an XL, normally wear M). XL fit fine!",1
5,"Kinda orange, but still very nice. Looks great with a black and stainless watch!",1
3,"It’s silky soft, but it feels kinda cheap (obviously though, i wasn’t expecting anything fantastic for the price). My biggest issue is that it will not stay closed no matter how much you overlap it or how tight you tie it, the second you move your arms your chest is out lol",0
4,These are adequate for a disposable glove. I wish I had gotten the next size up. usually use a large in most latex gloves - I really need an XL for these.,1
4,Great,1
5,Awesome band for reasonable price,1
5,Really nice shirt! The material is not cheap and the green color is the same as in the photo. I ordered a medium and I'm 5 foot and 120 lbs. It fits well (maybe a little large) but I don't mind. It's a little static prone but it's still a great shirt for work!,1
5,It looks really nice on.,1
4,Cute little addition to my bracelet. Nothing super duper special to look at but it's exactly as it looks in the pic. I'm pleased :),1
2,weak velcro,0
1,Purchased to wear to Gatlinburg for New Years  which turned out to be way to hot when we got there for anything warm so I just now got to wear it yesterday and today and when hanging it back up I noticed the zipper is already broken and comes apart without unzipping. Unfortunate the month return window shows closed but I’ll be reaching out because anything that only holds up for one wear isn’t worth purchasing. Fit is as expected and great if you like your stuff to tear up after wearing out one time,0
1,This jacket is far to small and very cheap looking and material wise.  It looks nice in the photo but when you see it in person it is very cheap. The gold zippers look like they have been spray painted :(,0
4,Love it!,1
5,It's beautiful.,1
1,Not good quality. Velcro is weak. The nose fell off day 1. Do not recommend.,0
5,Light weight and very comfortable. Thought I would have an issue being too hot - not the case as this is perfect. A tad sheer so not for walking around in front of the family. Purchase a second one !!,1
5,Muy linda,1
5,Really great quality,1
3,"I bought the white one, and it's sheer. Usually, it's not the case with the colored versions. Since I dislike wearing slips, I'll be returning it. Otherwise, the fit is as expected.",0
5,"We bought them to use as roller coaster sun glasses at an amusement park.<br /><br />My son loves them and they are durable, comfortable, and keep the sun and wind out of his eyes!",1
5,Sexy and classy !,1
3,Good,0
5,Great bike pants!,1
3,"I liked the cap, but it came with a defect.  Although, I cannot complain, the seller was on top of it to help me with my return.",0
1,"Extremely small, not happy with my purchase",0
1,Very beautiful and very dainty but also very weak and breakable. The metal bends so easily that the head snapped off the first time I wore it. :(,0
5,One of my favorite necklaces!,1
1,"Very poor box container, very bad quality of bracelet. I had to find a box and buy a better bracelet to improve the presentation of the item. I'm not happy with the wat it was delivered",0
2,"This shirt is not only smaller than a standard sized, it is shorter than advertised, the fit is off & the colors are not crisp as shown.",0
3,"The dress is nice and it looks even better when you put it on. The reason giving 3 stars is : after trying on the dress I decided to wash it , the dress faded a little but didn’t care , I got my dress ready after ironing and to my surprise when I put it in the zipper won’t come up, my husband try helping and nothing so I take it out and try to zip and that is when the zipper broke.. I’m so frustrated and disappointed, and I can’t return it..So my advise , try the zipper a couple of times before cutting the tags cause it may not go up",0
2,These gloves are very small and tight so if you have smaller hands it will be fine for you!,0
5,I do recommend it. My little girl loves it! The only one with the Orchid flower.,1
1,"EXTREMLY SMALL!!! Got a large, came looking like a xsmall/small",0
5,Quality material and it looks really nice! Love it!,1
1,No way can this thing be classified as a plus size. I'm a size 14 with a large bust and this thing is maybe better classified as a medium/large. Very disappointed,0
5,Loved it!!!,1
2,"The material of the hat was everything I expected and exactly what I paid for, but the size! There's no stretch or give to it AT ALL and there is no way my 7 month old was getting his head in this hat! It's really small, may be good for a newborn or an infant, but not much bigger at all.",0
1,"Not as pictured, has only 1 hole to accept the umbrella.  ours needs 2.  also, this pole is round in shape.  be careful in selecting this shipper, you have to pay shipping to return this item",0
5,Sexy dress lot of compliments. I bought a large. I'm 5'8 about 163,1
1,Garbage don't buy,0
3,my boy is 11m old - 18m old size was too small,0
2,The quality of the lining inside is good.. keeps the kid warm.. but the zip is very bad.. takes atleast 10 attempts before you can zip it up..for a product which is supposed to keep you warm.. an easy slide zip is a must..would not recommend this product.,0
1,Did not work. I say the review from ladies with larger boobs as myself (DD) that stated it worked so I decided to give it a try. But it definitely did not work nor stick properly. DONT BUY,0
3,"Good quality and great looking, but was a little snug to be an xlarge.",0
1,"The shop is a lack of respect in sending a wretched purse in an extremely big box that a laptop might fit .. it could not believe it when the above mentioned packing came to Venezuela, still I am thinking if they are normal persons what they did this! And in addition they refilled with paper the box as if it was a fragile article! The truth that it looks like a joke of evil I like ... I paid 250 grs for a box that goes to the garbage vs an article of 136 grs .. the sending to Venezuela charges for weight and waste money in a thing that does not cost a sorrow, I paid for a box, bony for garbage!",0
3,"I really liked these pants, but the fabric is see-through. I should have known, and what was I expecting with the apricot (cream) color? I thought about exchanging for a darker pair, but I'm afraid they will be too gauzy.",0
3,"I got myself a job that requires constant timing, before breaking the bank for something flashy I decided to do some research and find something budget friendly. I came across multiple sources this was the watch for something simple. The features are simple and I love it. My only complaint is that for the life of me I cant figure out how to keep the time stable? every other day its off and I cant figure out why. Other than that solid watch.",0
5,"Nice, sturdy fabric that doesn't show through. I'm 5'6.5&#34;, 160lbs and a size 10, 34F bra, 30in waist, 38 hips. The large is almost too big, but I haven't washed it and am banking on it shrinking a bit in the dryer. I'm going to order it in more colors!",1
5,This fits really well and was easy to put on. I was worried that the sticky material would be uncomfortable or make it difficult to move in but it was actually really comfortable. It's a very nice option under strapless or thin strapped dresses or shirts. I recommend this bra!,1
2,Awkward fit and somewhat open in the back so cant wear a bra,0
3,"The watch is OK.  I have a Casio Pathfinder that I love, and figured I would buy a Pro Trek as a back up.  The ProTrek is bulkier which is fine, i'd prefer it to be sleeker, but I can deal with it.  What was really disappointing the the cheap band that comes with it.  At the end of the band there is a raised area that prevents you from removing it from your wrist.  I was 5 seconds away from getting scissors to cut it off since band was such a pain to get off.  I really had to apply alot of pressure to remove it, and I dont think I will keep the watch as its such a pain to remove.  The rest of the features are similar to the Pathfinder and are ok.  I prefer the time in the center in bigger size which makes it easy to read.  The 'backlight' is not the true backlight that I had on the pathfinder, its more of a side light.  Not what I was expecting.  Overall I was disappointed with this purchase.",0
1,I did not receive the shirt pictured. The shirt I received was more of an open cardigan. You cannot button it. Very disappointed,0
4,Cute and not expensive,1
5,Buen material y muy bonitas.,1
5,Love these shoes. Extremely comfortable and stylish,1
5,"I looked at these earrings several times over a few month period. I loved them but couldn't justify spending the money on jewelry for myself. It was only after they became temporarily unavailable did I realize how much I really wanted the earrings. When they became available, I purchased them right away and have not been at all diappointed. Classic look, quality craftsmanship, beautiful stones.",1
5,Beautiful,1
4,"These are fairly long earrings with thick silver and decent detailing. The eye of Horus is very detailed but the lotus could use a bit more definition. Overall, good earrings for any fan of Ancient Egypt.",1
3,"My wife likes the style of these tennis shorts but was disappointed in the size. She compared it with her other athletic gear and these were about a full size smaller than as marked. A large size here was slightly smaller than her many other medium shorts. They also are a little long so she plans on using these more for casual wear than for athletic wear.<br /><br />Otherwise they are cute, well-styled, and function well for casual wear when she is out and about during the day.",0
5,Really cute. Well made.,1
5,Great product.,1
5,Had them delivered to my daughter in another state. She says they are perfect! She loves the perfect fit and colors!,1
4,I Love The Design Of The Overalls But I Wish That The Material Were Thick Jean Like Other Then Being Paper Thin. I Ordered A Size Bigger And It Fits Perfect Around My Hips But A Bit Too Baggy. For Any Tips I Would Recommend Wearing A Thick Shirt Under These Or A Jacket If Chilly Out. But Its Perfect For Warm Weather. 80/100,1
3,Quality isn’t that great,0
1,"One star is overly generous. Cheap plastic connectors do not work. Fitbit comes loose when you try to stretch the band to put it on your wrist. I own several similar bands from other manufacturers, and have never encountered this problem before.  I made the mistake of ordering this band TWICE, thinking I had just been unlucky the first time. Nope. Same problem the second time around. Unless you want to drop your Fitbit Luxe on the street, DO NOT BUY TGIS PRODUCT!",0
5,"The product came a lot sooner than was expected, no hassles! It was definitely worth the price I paid for it!",1
1,Images on pendant are horrible especially the Capricorn and Aries. Will not order again,0
1,Super disappointed!! This is not what is pictured at all!,0
5,I love these! I have a relatively large face (being 1.78m tall it makes sense) so I was worried they'd be a bit small but they fit perfectly and are super comfortable. :),1
1,Llego muy tarde. Pero a mi hijo le gusto,0
4,"Las compre hace dos años,  y siguen en perfecto estado.",1
3,"I only gave this 3 stars because I ordered it May 29th and didn't get it until July!  Too long for me.  But, that being said, it is cute and feels quality made.  I got several compliments on it the day I wore it. It feels sturdy like it will hold up in the laundry.  It does run small though.  I got an XL, which is usually pretty roomy on me and it is more snug than I would like.  It's not tight by any means, but definitely doesn't feel like an XL.",0
4,Good studs but don’t expect to get all the colors pictured. Mine came with a few duplicates of the same color. Kinda disappointed.,1
3,I exchanged my patterned wrap dress from this seller for this dress thinking it’d be that same lightweight material. It is in NO WAY light weight not same sizing as the other dresses,0
4,"Love these and took them with me to Mexico. Very cute, but not stretchy at the waist. I recommend buying up a size or two on this one.",1
2,very beautiful and well made however too tight on my 2 year old. Hoping to get a 3T but not for an additional $30!!,0
1,"They are impossible to wear, as there is no clasp for the Post.",0
3,its fragil but is amazing,0
5,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. She genuinely likes it, and I’ve seen her wear it on more then one occasion.",1
4,Great quality. Bought it a month ago and have been wearing it since.  I don’t even take it off when I workout or shower and it doesn’t get in the way.  Definitely recommend.,1
5,It ROCs,1
2,"My hat size is 8 3/4&#34; and the large was too big for me, which is unusual. Also very stiff, and too much 'rise' meaning too high off my head.",0
1,These are NOT high waisted- not even close.  The fit around my calves/ankles is wonky and loose and they sag while working out and bunch up.  Worst leggings I’ve gotten in years.,0
1,Way to small and didnt fit.,0
1,"my necklace arrive broken :(<br />just go to the 99 cent store for the same type of product, somewhat disapointed, but is it really worth returning??",0
1,"Not the correct color...not dark grey!!! I can still work with the glasses though, they are nice but not the color I was looking for.",0
1,To big for little kids. Better for teens.,0
5,Very pretty- it's almost delicate looking with it has good weight to it. I love it and I got it fast.,1
5,"The sweater is absolutely beautiful! I ordered my normal size and it was small. Fortunately. It fit my sister, so she has it and loves it. The quality is excellent and the color is rich and vibrant.",1
2,We ordered the blue shark ones and they are not cotton. Stiff and polyester feeling material.  We have the green dinosaur ones and LOVE them!  These are definitely different.  I’m returning them.,0
5,Me encantó ¡,1
3,to  small  but the material is good I will give it to my daughter,0
1,The green is a great colour but you see everything brown when looking through them,0
5,So pretty and durable!,1
5,"The one that I got has the most perfect autumn colors, it's beautiful and very soft. The size is also good and it isn't too small. It's nice and warm and I really like it! As other reviews have mentioned, it can drop a lot of lint (especially when up against a coarser fabric, like a heavy knit sweater) but I don't think that's really a big deal. Overall I'm very pleased.<br />It did have a factory smell when I first took it out of the packaging, but after hanging it up for a day and letting it air out, the smell was gone.",1
3,Yes loved it,0
3,smaller then expect most pieces were broken.,0
3,"Quality is very bad, feels more like plastic than anything else. I understand it was a cheap but it looks way better in photo than in real life. Its good for a costume though!",0
5,"Comfortable, looks like you’d expect a fjallraven jacket to look, nice hood. Is not wind proof, which is another way to say it’s super breathable. Seems to be snow proof, haven’t worn it in the rain. I like it a lot for backcountry /touring.",1
3,"I am returning them because the strap on one of the shoes is too large and can't be adjusted.  I like the shoe and the color, everything else was fine.",0
2,Did not send belt. Had to return,0
1,My pants did not come how it look in the photo I would like my refund back. This is a terrible piece of merch.,0
2,"Loved the style, as compared to other compression socks.  However, they do not stay up and both pairs of the polka-dot design developed holes after a few months of wear.",0
1,I bought them for my hubby but they are super short and no contention for the equipment,0
2,I am done buying from China.  The delivery time is long and the quality is short.<br />The center stone is small and has no sparkle.  The 'crystals' that surround it look like glass.<br />The chain is not substantial.  There is a reason jewelry is cheap. It's not even worth the low price.,0
5,Very well made and comfortable.,1
5,Love this dress.,1
3,"I received 2 of these cute little bracelets. One with 4 shells and 1 with 6. The 4 shell bracelet won’t go over my hand even though it says it extends to 13”. It has the same specs as the 6 shell on the sales page, but in real life it’s much smaller. It’s a cheap little item and doesn’t look like it would last long, but I bet a 12 year old would Love it. It comes in a pretty velvet pouch and would make a perfect stocking stuffer.",0
5,Perfect,1
5,"Very nice quality, and  look great  in person.  The size is good. Better than I expected.  I wear them everyday. These are the first silver earrings I have liked in years.  I would buy again.",1
5,Usually a large but the medium fit perfectly! I am 5’2 & it was long on me. So cute though! Great for my wine tasting birthday celebration 💛,1
5,"I now own several pair of Dudama sunglasses for a variety of looks and purposes and I've found them all to be of good quality, solid build, and durable. I really like these glasses and the fit superb, especially given the very reasonable price.  I have a fairly large head but these fit great.  The nose bridge is anti-slip and the temples snugly fit the sides of my head.  The wrap around is perfect and there is no distortion of my vision while wearing these.<br /><br />I like the look.  It is definitely a racy sophisticated look that goes well with a wide variety of styles.  I'd wear these, but so would my sons, and given my 25 yr old son's reaction when trying them on, I may have to make a phone call if they go missing  :) .  They come in a black bag that feels like a good quality lens cleaning cloth, but the package also includes a small cleaning cloth as well.<br /><br />The lenses tend to look quite gray on the product listing, but I've found these to be more of a blue.  While it's blocking out the harmful rays, it does not leave you with diminished vision and I could see everything quite clearly.  They aren't as dark as they look and so you can wear these well into the evening.  I wore these into direct sunlight without a bit if problem with artifacts [refractive elements] in the plastic lenses that often plague less expensive [and sometimes even very expensive] sunglasses.<br /><br />These glasses aren't going to break the bank but they are decent quality and I have no problem recommending them to anyone.  I received a free copy for evaluation purposes and an honest and fair review.",1
5,Good quality,1
2,"I'm typically a modern day US 8, I ordered a large and it fit how I wanted it to fit- figure hugging, lots of cleavage and flattering on the waist. I planned to wear it with a blazer to class up the cleave at 39, however heading for the door the first day my husband said wow, the red under the boobs is interesting! It was my bra.... where the chest portion of the top meets the bottom- I have curves but there are not sharp pokey objects on me to rip seams and I hadn't even washed it yet!! If you know how to sew this shirt is for you- if not maybe avoid it and find something higher quality. Thankfully he saw me and I didn't venture into the world with under boob bra exposed.",0
1,Love is shirt but came with tons of pulls and runs,0
5,"Such a cute dress! It's just as pictured. The dress fit as expected and is very flattering. My only complaint is the buttons will have to be stitched more securely and the button holes may have to be stitched around, they have gotten very stringy/thready(?) after buttoning/unbuttoning the dress twice.",1
2,I should have returned it. But I am 36B and this does absolutely nothing for my cleavage. I just go braless.,0
2,The pearl keep falling apart,0
2,thought they were a decent shoe at a low cost but the are what you should expect at that price. Falling apart after a couple months and the rubber soles are almost worn away. Cheap crappy shoe for a low price,0
5,"I have a shaved....but large head. I figured the bigger size would fit best. Because theband has some stretch, Iit wound up fitting bigger than I expected. I'm going to order the black cap but in the smaller size, and hope it fits comfortably.",1
1,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. It's like a shiny, stretchy swimsuit material and looks odd and cheap as a dress. It does fit as expected but I returned it.",0
1,"I bought this for the Electric Daisy Carnival in NY and half way into the second dj set, a hole was made in the back. All i had inside was my car keys, cash, chap stick and my phone. Do not spend your money on this fanny pack. I almost lost my car keys with this!",0
3,"What I liked is the size of the tag. What I did not like was on 1,  I ordered one side with capital letters for the name and lower case on the other side…..received both sides as capital letters.  A bit disappointed but the workmanship was good and the other tag was perfect.",0
5,I like the shirt awesome Nike product,1
4,"I like the sweater but its a little short but not horribly so, the fit around is good. Very soft, not as warm as lambs wool.",1
1,dead battery,0
4,I really like it. I have been wearing it since I first got it.,1
5,"As expected, fit my pair of aviators from fossil that i lost the bag for. Good quality.",1
4,"I like them. Do they have any sort of tummy hold? No. If you need tummy hold this would not count as tummy hold. I am between a L and XL and I went XL so they fit comfortable on the looser side, but in turn they aren’t see through, a L on my booty would have been very see through.",1
5,This was the real deal ! High quality materials,1
5,"Wonderful helper!  I don't know how I fastened a bracelet before ordering this.  Each time I use it, it seems to be easier to use.",1
3,"I returned it because the length was too long and I don't like it when my bottom cuffs drag on the ground. Just a warning that the material feels like a swim suit. I felt that wearing it around during the summer would make me too warm, since the material isn't as breathable. I'll probably look for the same style somewhere else.",0
2,Look nice but were super uncomfortable on the base of the foot,0
1,This fit like an XS.,0
4,The color is great. The dress wrinkles easily though.,1
5,Feels great and looks great. Overall I am happy with the product.,1
5,I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I hope she likes it. I think it will fit her okay,1
5,"Looked surprisingly good. Comes in in a fancy box. All of the above, makes it a really good gift!",1

5,Excelente,1
2,Very poor quality.,0

3,The shoes are ok but the size es too large.,0
3,I purposely bought these for the navy blue mask to match my daughters sports uniform and it did not come with blue as advertised. It came with 3 black and one gray.,0
5,Excellent shapwear and more flexible and comfortable than spanx,1
5,Great product,1
2,"It was unravelling when I tried it on. And it's not as robust, meaning full and Long, as pictured.",0
5,nice and cute,1
3,"Very attractive, holds most of my jewelry, but the wire is very thin and will not take much for the leaves to break off.",0
5,Fit to perfection,1
5,I am very satisfied with these shades!,1
5,I get so many compliments on these shoes. They are very comfortable too.,1
4,"The elastic is a little loose, and the actual buttons are lower than I like. The shorts are pretty great though.",1
5,"I love it, it's so comfortable.",1
1,can't even fit in the top :( runs too small,0
1,Doesn’t specify this specific one size large is for a toddler,0
1,"Let me start off by saying I own eight watches of varying levels of cost, from entry level to luxury pieces, and I've purchased quite a few watchbands, either as replacements or as an accessory when I don't want to wear one of my steel watches on the bracelet.<br /><br />I typically buy deBeer straps as I find their quality to be exceptional for the money, but I've seen a lot of positive feedback on Hirsch, so I decided to give this one a try.  Maybe it's because this is one of their more entry level straps (they have premium alligator and croc bands that are several hundred dollars), but I found the quality to be very poor.<br /><br />Let's start with the most glaring flaw, the pin buckle.  It's one of the cheapest feeling I've ever seen.  It's a tinny and flimsy thing, so much so that it barely felt like actual metal.  I've purchased silicone watch bands from places like Barton at half the cost of this band with a pin buckle that would put this band to shame.<br /><br />The band itself looks attractive enough at a glance, but the tactile feel of it is one of incredible cheapness.  The bottom of the strap feels like cardboard, and the top feels rough and scratchy to the touch.  It's a stitched band rather than bonded, which I prefer, but there's precious little bolstering added.<br /><br />I recently purchased a genuine crocodile strap from deBeer for about the same cost, and the pin buckle and construction were leagues better than this.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend at all, especially if planning on pairing it with a higher quality timepiece.  Maybe their upper end straps are better made, it's certainly possible, but the quality of this one (or lack thereof) would have me thinking twice about ordering another one.",0
2,"too small to get in ear.  wanted a small ring that I could sleep in, but can't get in so they are not for adults.",0
3,"I liked the top to this swimsuit it fit perfect, the bottoms were a little bit tight but if I lose like 10 lbs it will prob work just fine so I'm going to keep it. I thought about ordering the XL just to have bigger bottoms and I'd keep the top from the large but hmm 😒 the top seems like it could almost be too big in the back I'm a 34 DD, but if I went down a size I know it would be too tight and the bottoms wouldn't work at all.",0
3,"The material is good however, fits small and flattens my chest.",0
4,I got so many compliments on this dress. Slip underneath could be a little longer,1
1,This dress is CRAP! Made like crap & looks worse! Lace had brown spots ALL over BOTH dresses I bought! WOW!,0
1,Nothing like advertisement,0
2,"One important positive is that this item was packaged and mailed very quickly during a holiday period. Much appreciated! The scarf is disappointing. The material looks and feels 'cheap' and the designs/logos are not crisp or sharp. It is fleece, but it is not a good quality.",0
3,They're okay but I would probably buy a better quality product next time,0
4,"It looks like it does in the picture. My only complaint is that the clasp is super low quality. It works, but you have to manually close it because it's so cheap haha. I guess you get what you pay for. I debated between three and four stars for this, but since it's so inexpensive, and the clasp does technically work (with a little help) I figured I'd go ahead and give it four stars. After all it IS a super sweet necklace for relatively cheap.",1
5,I love the variety of earrings included in this set of boho earrings! So cute! They don’t irritate my sensitive ears either! Love them!,1
1,Poorly sized,0
2,The frames are not as large as the picture shows. The frame is small...so if he you have a big head/face these glasses are not going to look right. They are for little head/face people. The picture is somewhat misleading.,0
3,Smaller than expected but nice colors & materials,0
1,Bad quality,0
5,"this little fan was a tremendous help during a recent trip through Europe this summer, during the worst heatwave in 30 years.<br /><br />Walking all day and finding a cool/shady spot was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. This fan is small enough I could throw in my purse or backpack and use as needed, which was pretty much all the time. I fully charged before it's first use and it lasts about 5 hours from a single charge.",1
2,Very cheap! Not a fan,0
5,"Use these during the day, and my HD driving glasses at night.",1
3,"This watch band is super adorable and stretches really nicely (which is sort of a must with how stiff the clasp is and how hard it is to open). I never ran into any issues with the pins popping out, but I did get a rash from where the metal clasp touches my skin. The only thing I've had reactions to is nickel so I can only assume there's some in the steel. Real shame, it's a perfect band otherwise.",0
3,Shirt was adorable. However- I ordered two sizes larger and it still did not fit,0
5,fit her just fine,1
5,Really nice product! You really get your money's worth!,1
1,I bought this wallet after i threw out my old one away. So i went online and got this one because the price was good and seemed like a good wallet. After i started using this wallet all my credit cards started to break. Wouldn't recommend it.,0
3,Really cute! Need one size smaller.,0
5,Beautiful,1
5,"Great looking watch, fairly heavy but if you know Invicta you already know and like a good heavy piece. No replacing batteries is a plus for me.",1
5,Good Quality,1
2,"This blouse was SO staticky I couldn’t even wear it! I tried everything that always works for tough static cling and could NOT keep the blouse from clinging to me, sticking to itself, shocking me, and making scary static sounds when I tried to peel it off me. I’ll be returning for a refund. I’m disappointed because it was cute, but the fabric was so chintzy, it is practically a shock hazard to wear it. It was also bigger in the chest/body than expected, shorter in the torso (I have a normal length torso and could barely tuck in this shirt and it was way too wide and boxy to leave untucked at all - it definitely would not stay tucked in with the slightest movement), and the sleeves were way too short. I have long arms and am used to sleeves being a bit short, but these were WAY too short. They were just barely 3/4-length, which isn’t an attractive length sleeve for this shirt style. The warning that it is see-through was accurate, but expected for this style of shirt. A camisole underneath looked fine. The shirt is definitely shaped more like a box than a tailored shirt. I’m 5’4” and around 110 pounds and ordered a small - it was too short in the torso, too wide/big in the body (chest/waist/back), too big in the shoulders, perfect at the neck, and the sleeves were about 3” too short.",0
2,Ok,0
5,Perfect fit.,1
4,"Clothing for different sporting teams can often be dull, plain, & almost too masculine at times but I loved that I could still support one of my favs but still look girly.  Very comfy!!",1
1,piece of garbage,0
5,The dress is perfect for a cocktail occasion and receive lots of compliments,1
3,The leggings fit true to size and make my legs look slender however they are a bit thinner than I like. Guess that could be a good thing as warmer weather sets in but I do like other leggings much better than these.,0
3,Material not AS EXPECTED. I am returning it.,0
3,"Wife liked it, all that matters",0
3,Tarnished within a week,0
3,Didn't stay in foot when running. No way to tighten fit.,0
5,Very nice for stadium and other public events where security requires a clear bag. It's roomy but not awkward to carry.  I just used mine to see the Blue Angels in San Diego.,1
3,Was good for the price. Writing is a little fuzzy.,0
1,When you all describe the gloves been mini you were not kidding. I had to get a magnifying glasses to see them.,0
2,Definitely not xxl  I’d say lucky you could call them a large. I got xxl from hospital and they cover my ankle. These  hardly cover my heel. Poor quality they are very thin. Would not recommend,0
1,Awkward fit & very baggy. I bought a small and it was still huge.,0
5,The colors are even more brilliant than in the pictures.  My daughter loves these!,1
1,large fits like medium,0
5,Beautiful Wallet  I love it,1
1,fit oddly big at bust and tight at hips but lovely fabric...,0
5,Bought this as part of a saloon girl costume for Halloween this year and it was perfect! The deep purple was absolutely gorgeous.,1
2,the mask is so big I had to sew the sides to get it to fit properly not to mention it is paper thin! Complete waste of money!,0
3,"I’m a bit larger busted right now (nursing Mama) and couldn’t get the buttons to lay comfortably. The dress was pulling apart in the chest area even though the rest of the fit was good. It would be better if you are smaller busted in my opinion. Also, plan to do some serious ironing or steaming. It came out of the bag looking awful. It was hard to even get an idea of the style when trying it on because of the deep wrinkles.",0
4,Lots of compliments - beautiful color.,1
2,"This item should be $5, not $15. They look like a craft project that someone made out of felt, super glue and a head band.",0
5,"They’re very cute. I like the blue little beads, I took them to school and received some compliments !",1
1,"At first I thought I didn't screw the thread in correctly , when it happened to the second and third one within a day I realized the thread is too small to fit the bar and it falls off",0
5,These fit a little bigger than I expected. They’re great leggings. The pockets are both big enough for a phone and things don’t fall out. I like them a lot and plan to order a second pair.,1
5,"This product from Bling Jewelry was nice because it was a brighter silver color than other stainless steel necklaces I have seen, and seems to be good quality. The necklace also came in a nice velvet-like pouch",1
5,I've gotten so many compliments on these. I love them! I purchased a case for it so it doesn't scratch.,1
1,not true to size,0
2,Loved them but after only wearing once one of the screws came out,0
2,This is a super cute shirt and very good quaility but extremely way to big. I can nor even wear it and I bought 2 of them.,0
5,Looks good<br />Very comfortable,1
1,The description says 1 size fits all.  Trust me.... it’s a small.  My 13 year old barely fits it.  If you weigh about 125-135lbs it’s perfect for you.,0
1,"I really wanted this bra but its just like all other strapless bras no support as claimed, bugles at the sides and the strap. It also came with the cups all folder in and couldnt get them flatened out. The card i used is no longer valid and i cant contact anyone to say this. The only refunds are get a new one or the card used. Just refunding to amazon account would be nice. Now im stuck with a non functional bra i will never enjoy. I do not recommend this product. :-(",0
4,Cute purse for kids. Only thing was the edging started coming off at the end of our 5 day vacation.,1
3,"A few pieces have fallen off. Still looks good, though.",0

5,Very durable & easy to change out.,1

3,Works ok at times but seems to loose connections at most inopportune moments ..,0
5,my son loved them fit perfectly,1
5,Awesome product. I use it for many quilting tasks. I especially like how it helps with &#34;finger&#34; pressing.,1
5,After reading reviews I ordered a size up. Fit perfectly. I really like it.,1
2,"So I got these for my daughter who loves yoga and work out pants.  When she saw the pic she was looking forward to trying them out.  She is about 5 ft 6 inches tall, 125 lbs and usually wears a SMALL in shorts.  I ordered her a MeDIUM because its China and everything they sell runs very very small.  Needless to say, they fit her but she did not like the high waisted fit or the gathering of the material in her buttocks area.  She found them unflattering and will not wear them again.<br /><br />To each is own but if you are picky then I would pass on this one..",0
1,"Cute patterns and thickly lined. They even threw in a cute head band. Unfortunately, after 2 washes, it started fraying, stitches starts to come out, and pilling. So not worth the money. I would not recommend.",0
2,It's a really cool idea my friends laughed a lot and it definitely provided smiles however it came with a tear and there his eye was hanging down. After a little tape it was not a big deal but still kind of pricey for that type of quality,0
5,This Dress is beautiful and got many compliments. I would definitely buy other colors.,1
3,"Love the look of these earrings, but my pair had one major flaw. The piece (hook and loop) where the 2 half’s of the earring met was very weak and the eventually snapped from the weight. Very upset as these were my go to statement piece :(",0
3,"I ordered XL and normally medium to size 16 fits perfectly. The XL was too small.  Wish it did fit...it's very cute. Oh well, returning it.",0
5,Good to work out in. The fabric is thin,1
3,Do you have a small lady head? This night be a good fit for you. If you have a normal sized man head? Too tight. The pocket for filter sticks open and filter creeps out. Ear loops are to small and too close to front so pulls on your ears. Would be good for child who wants to look like a ninja n,0
5,Love it! Great quality!,1

2,itchy,0

2,Way too small. I ordered a 3x and I wear a 14 :(,0
1,"OMG. In spite of one customer detailed bad review of this bag, i went ahead and bought this bag. What a mistake. Bought this around Christmas 2015, now 2 months later i am looking to buy another gym bag. Everything the review  mentioned about the shoe compartment and the thin nylon, so true. Mine was all tore up a month later. The handle has broken off already, the front pocket zipper no longer work. The material is falling apart at different spots. I only use this 4 times a week to go from my car to the the gym. No heavy duty at all, no long walk carrying the bag. I live in Florida, we drive everywhere. This bag is a big pile of mess. As soon as you put one item in there, the bag looks so much bigger than it is. I hate carrying this bag in to the gym. I need something smaller, more chic, just a better durable bag. I knew it was cheap so i expect to at least use it for 6 months or so. Not so lucky. Don't buy this bag.",0
1,Way too small. I'm smaller on the bottom and ordered 1 size up to play it safe and it was still small.,0
5,This product met all of my expectations from the looks to the delivery. I would definitely order again.,1
1,These are not good leggings.,0
1,Very cheaply made.  Chains broke when we opened the package.  You get what you pay for!  Don’t waste your money!,0
4,It was cute,1
4,"Cute - similar material to husband's jersey. However, i took a star away because it's a little bigger than i imagined. It would be nice if there was a sizing guide on the description. I'd say 9-12 months maybe?",1
1,"Ordered a size 14. Package arrived w/inner bag opened inside the box, labeled 12/13. No sizing tag on actual product. Thin fabric. Not a fluffy robe",0
1,never bought this,0
1,"size is way off, and quality very poor",0
5,This is the BEST skirt I have bought in YEARS! I will be purchasing another as soon as possible. I wear a small that small is a tad bit roomy but I will get another small...who wants a tight skirt?,1
1,These are ok. Looks like some slacks were cut off and then side pockets were added. No issues with stitching or zipper. The material feels thinner and lighter than my other cargos which I'm beginning to like. The belt is confusing to use and nothing special. I would never buy it separately. The main thing is the color. I ordered the gray and it is much lighter and dare I think they sent me a khaki pair but they are not quite khaki color. Don't know but I do know they are not the same as pictured.<br /><br />Update: After a wash they look a little better less like a pair of slacks that were cut and had pockets sewn on the sides. Also figured out the belt. For the money I'm bumping it up 1 star.<br /><br />Update: Seems if you buy another pair you can only write a review for the entire brand and not individual colors. I like these shorts I bought 3 different colors. But the khaki colored pair run small. When I received them I thought they would fit like the previous pairs so I just threw them in the wash so I could wear them. They run small. I want to exchange them if I can but i don't think they will after wash and wear. Too bad i liked these it's just the khaki one ran small.,0
5,"Really nice, well made. Since it's a 'skinny' cut you may do best if you size it up a level compared to normal.",1
5,"Good quality, fair price.  Gets lots of comments.  A great item to organize and take on the go for creative-minded Star Wars fans.",1
4,Looks like the picture. Great for nursing momma's.,1
4,Only 4 stars becuse you cant take the chain off without cutting it. So I can fit my larger chain.<br />The one it comes with is really cool with Magnetic Hasp. I hate to cut it but I'll break it anyways if I wear it. 🤷‍♀️ Love the Charm though!,1
5,There is plenty space to pack everything you could use for a weekend get away. Love the style color and design,1
2,Returned.  Pattern was faded and looked inexpensive.,0
1,"I can’t fit the earring in my ear hole; It’s huge and hurts trying to force them in. I wish they were thinner, they look good (like they would be perfect with everything).",0
5,Love it,1
4,Got a 3xxxl but noway it is try it on fell like a large in kids size but it looks nice,1
5,Literally the best bag I havr ever owned. It fits my 10.5 inch ipad (8th gen)  Honedtly dont really write reviews. And well. This one deservres it.,1
2,"First of all, these are not a black lens with a gradient effect...The lens is purple when you are out in the sun which i cannot stand! I bought these as a gift for my BF and they fit him fine, but I just wish the lens was black and not a purple color.",0
5,Great fit and easy to use.  Very pretty design also.,1
5,"Was a gift for my boyfriends little sister who loves Billie Eilish. She wears it all of the time. She loves it! I think it’s a cheaper material, not real silver. But that’s obviously why the price is so good.",1
5,"I loved these boots and would have kept them if they weren’t too narrow for my feet. I was so disappointed because they were perfect.<br />They had a great sole to keep you from slipping around in muddy situations. If your foot is narrow to medium, I highly recommend!",1
1,[[VIDEOID:6ddc91fd9725fd662bce40b42a82c6e6]] The way they fit and feel on my feet. They feel like you're wearing boxes on your feet.,0
1,Terrible material,0
2,I was surprised with the order I hadn’t gone past putting it in the cart but since I needed them I decided to try them once you get them on beside the lack of arch support they r pretty comfortable but kinda stiff and the no need to tie laces is great but they don’t skip in very easily. I’m hoping they break in soon and I git insole inserts,0
5,These hoops are thin but not so thin that you feel they'll break at the slightest pull.<br />I've been looking for a long time; purchased a pair from QVC that were so flimsy I returned them and exchanged them for a pair that were too thick.<br />Returned those too!!<br />These are just what I was looking for. Perfect for every day use!!,1
1,Band were to small try getting new one but did not get any responses...,0
5,Can't wait to wear this to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!!!,1
5,Great compression sock.  Use them daily.,1
1,"Battery was bad, waste of money, couldn’t return",0
1,There are nice thights but the size comes too small … you have to size up 2 sizes an xlarge seems like a medium,0
1,This is the farthest thing from a beach towel or any other kind of towel. I'm very disappointed. I can only describe it as a sarong. It's almost see through. It's a very cute print and that's all I can say for it.,0
1,Was not like the picture,0
5,Does not show and does not slip off,1
5,"This was literally my favorite purchase of the year! Great sweatshirt and excellent quality! If you love The Golden Girls and quote Means Girls all the time, this is perfect for you!",1
1,Cheap. Of course you get what you pay for. Will not buy again. Fell apart the first day.,0
1,"Too narrow, couldn't give them away.",0
1,"I have no idea what this is supposed to be, but it was crap. It looks nothing like the picture. I couldn't get my big toe in a dress that was supposedly a 3XL. It's not even a size 3. Then, since this crap obviously came from China, there were no return instructions. AMAZON needs to take this off of its site.",0
5,Love the fit and design!,1
5,Very cute dress. I’m 5’4” and it is a bit short. It’s nice with flats.. I wish they made this dress knee length! I’d buy them all. I’m 40 so the length is debatable :-),1
3,I used the glove when I first got them and they had a good grip. After a few uses the grip went away so I would not suggest you buy this.,0
4,Comfortable socks for camping and hiking!<br /><br />I found that these socks are excellent for long hikes or camping. They provide excellent padding in all the places where I typically develop blisters.  Whether it’s around the toes or ankle that you tend to rub when on long hikes these socks have you covered. They reinforced all of this critical areas providing added padding and strength.<br /><br />These socks are a tad warmer blend than my normal hiking soles but definitely not as warm as my winter hiking socks. I would advise these for spring or fall.<br /><br />A word of caution that is common with all socks in this style is if they happen to get wet they required more time than I<br />typical to dry.<br /><br />After fully testing this product I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it or purchase it next time I need this type of item.,1
5,I get so many compliments on this necklace. I work as a bartender and wear it all the time and it hasn't tarnished or broke considering the kind of stuff I may get on me while bartending and all of the sweating and moving around I do.,1
1,Although I ordered the size base on my height and weight the belt loops were at the base of my ribs and the pockets were not at my sides but overlapping in the front. I returned this robe immediately marked as defective.,0
5,My daughter absolutely loves this necklace. It matches all her Minnie clothing. She gets a lot of compliments,1
5,"I was completely surprised at the quality of this dress. I purchased another floral print and fell in love with it. The dress is comfortable, very cute and flattering, nice material, easy to wash and care for. The only thing that would make this dress better, is if it had pockets. This dress is great for so many occasions, if you want it go ahead and buy it.",1
5,good quality stuff,1
5,"This is my second order of these socks, so I must like them. After having 4 stress fractures I have pain in my feet. I found these socks helped with the pain and the swelling. I am now retired and not on my feet 8 hours a day but the socks still feel good.",1
3,"I had no intention of trying these goggles when I did, but I just couldn't wait for my vacation to test them and see how they performed.  I don't want to bring defective goggles on vacation, right?  My boy did not want to leave the pool after his swimming lesson, so we hung back and waited until their open swim session.  I had two different goggles to try out, so I immediately put these on.  I love that you can undo the back, especially as mine tend to snag and take a hair or two along for the ride.  Ouch.  I wanted the strap under my hair and that's really hard to do when you have to pull the strap over your head.  I snapped it in place and tried to make the proper adjustments.  You can't do it while the goggles are on (or at least I couldn't), so I had to take them off, try to adjust, and then put them back on to find it still needed more adjusting.  I found it hard to adjust the straps.  I got so used to my son's goggles (push a button and then pull the band to tighten or loosen).  These aren't that way and I struggled with the band.  I finally got it to where I thought I needed it.  There are no instructions or guide that comes with the goggles.  It's just the goggles, ear plugs, and a nose plug in a mesh bag.  I think they slipped some because they kept the water out in the beginning (I was very cautious for my first try) and then I noticed I was getting some water inside.  I readjusted the goggles on my face and it seemed to hold longer. I had rings around my eyes from having the goggles on for 20 minutes, so maybe I need to find that perfect fit still.<br /><br />I read one review that mentions being afraid the little clip in the back would suddenly unsnap and water could rush in.  I gotta say I also felt that way.  It's a thin plastic button that sorta slips into a little ring thing and then snaps.  I wear contacts and don't know that I would trust it to hold for a long period of time.  However I can't fault the goggles and am taking no star(s) away for this clip because it is intact and has held when worn. My rating is based on my personal experience with it and the difficulty I experienced adjusting it.  The UV protection is great and the goggles look good.  The mesh bag is kind of strange because every other pair of goggles I've purchased had a hard case.  This bag can be used to collect seashells or something, but I will have to find another travel case for the goggles.  I'll also work on getting the goggles adjusted right.<br /><br />Note: I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",0
5,"I'm 5'8 and I was looking for so long for a heel that was the perfect height. These heels are great priced and the heel doesn't make me look too tall. Overall great shoe, very true to size.",1
2,The decorative paint on the temples (arms) is a cheap sticker that quickly wears and peals off the metal.,0
2,They don't work well at all.,0
3,Didn't fit to size,0
3,"Way too small for what I needed it for. I needed it for work and was hoping it had more room to store paperwork, folders, crafts etc but it barely fits the essentials. This would be a good weekend bag perhaps, just to store the basics.",0
3,I bought this for my best friend se was so happy it made her cry I thought it was a little pricey but I can't complain it was worth it with how happy it made her,0
5,Stretchy and cute graphics. I’m a medium and about 130 pounds. Fit nicely.,1
2,"These are really good for sublimation. I liked how bright the ink shows up, the feel of the shirt is good. I ordered xl & they fit more like a large but they worked great for the shirts that I needed to make.",0
1,Very thin and cheap material.  Looks nice but that is about it.,0
3,Nothing special,0
5,I bought this piece for my daughter bday dinner and words can't Express how pretty this set looks...the picture does it no justice,1
1,"I received these less than a month ago. I do all my laundry in cold water, on permanent press, and hang to dry. The seams are already ripping apart -- not just loose stitches, but 1&#34;+ holes in the armpits, and not just on one shirt but at least a couple of them. I have older Hanes t-shirts that have held up better -- they are ruining their brand with cheap quality shirts like these!",0
2,Really cute dress but incredibly oversized (which I knew and wanted).  Even the small would have been way to oversized for me.  Also very thin material and see through.,0
5,My granddaughter love minnie mouse and I purchased these for her for a variety and it was  a very good price for three of the minnie mouse shirts.  I think the quality is good and the fit was as expected.. I did buy a size larger for her only because she is in between sizing right now and I wanted her to have them longer theyre so cute.  She absolutely loves them.,1
5,Love how these look! Dupe for rayband for sure and the quality is great!!!,1
1,So pretty and came packaged nicely but broke after 5 hours of normal wear.,0
5,"Well made, delivered on time and great value for the price. Thanks",1
3,I should have followed the size chart.  I went up a size because I was nervous that it would run small but it runs pretty true to size.  I like the color.  Deep plunging V so I plan on a cami underneath.,0
1,The fabric for the skirt does not stretch. If you have hips do not buy the skirts. I would not buy this again had I known the fabric wouldn't stretch.,0
3,The color is orange orange,0
5,"I liked both of the robes I purchased, but the shorter one was a better choice for (short) me.  The materials have a nice hand, and the decorations on each were refined.  I would recommend them.",1
5,Beautiful bracelet - very heavy and well made.,1
4,Very satisfied great quality and amazing price I just picked a size to big but overall it's great,1
5,Good,1
5,Better than expected,1
3,"I thought I had found my FAVORITE undies!!! But, on my second order, quality issues after having used them , lets say 2 months (like 5 times each) they rip from the perineum area... I have purchased Obviously, and wore them like 4 times more and they are still perfevt, can't say the same for David Archy...",0
1,Just think they look cheap but considering the price  not too bad,0
4,Way bigger than I was expecting (although I know it’s supposed to be oversized). Nothing a little bit of fashion tape won’t fix. Otherwise I’m in love.,1
5,Keeps my women friends in place 😀,1
3,Too late to return,0
4,"A bit cheap looking, but it was perfect for the woman's march! Now, I wear it to bed!",1
2,"This video would be a great workout if the combinations weren't so fast and complicated. I've been kickboxing for 2 years, and there is no chance I could follow this. I'm usually pretty stubborn, and have to finish what I start, but I got too frustrated with this video and actually quit half way through. I'm disappointed...",0
5,Warm. Sturdy pockets and seams. Color is light gray.,1
3,I’ve bought this dress more than once and the fit is inconsistent.,0
3,Its the best purchase in my life... I love it! I really love it. i can to recommend this item.,0
1,By far the cheapest POS conceivable. My first one lasted 3 months before burning out. My second one only 2 months. Never again!,0
5,"Love this bathing suit, very unique & fit great!",1
1,"The box arrived bent and crushed.  Usually Amazon sends a picture of the item on my porch when they drop it off; I guess this time they were too ashamed to.  No directions for assembly were included, the umbrella pole  doesn't fit the stand. I haven't finished trying to assemble it, but it looks like it will be to short.",0
2,"Fabric is nice but the quality is eh. Alot of the stitching is loose on the buttons and around the hems. It looks nice but just from one gentle wash I am already going to have to sew buttons back on. Also, I ordered a small and my top runs a little on the big size and the bottoms run small. I could probably wear an XS top and a M bottom. The sizing is awkward. I wouldn't repurchase these.",0
5,"Great fit, comfy material, 5'5&#34; 135lbs ordered a medium, just about the knee, thick material below waist so it's not see threw, light enough for a hot summer day. Highly recommend.",1
2,"They feel good, and they fit okay.  They were a bit too big in the waist, and I have to frequently pull them up. I've washed them three times, and the seams are already falling apart.  I've had to sew up one seem on the right thigh that's already come undone, and the same seam on the left side looks like it's about had it with life. The waist is already falling apart.",0
1,The size is most definitely not accurate. I bought a large and it was more like a 2 or 3 xl. It’s huge! So I went back and ordered a small and it is more like a xlg. Still way too big. Ridiculous!,0
5,Good quality.,1
5,The person I bought this for loved this watch! Very classy and fit perfectly.,1
5,Many compliments  very well made.,1
5,"Lenses were a perfect fit! Instead of replacing $300 sunglasses, I replaced $30 lenses! Great idea!",1
4,"Good fit,  cute",1
5,I am very happy with the bracelet!!! It was a gift for my son and he loves it.,1
3,"Nice color and fabric, although it is a little thing. Definitely fits small, I would order a size up. Going to return mine due to sizing.",0
1,Was disappointed on how much smaller this was in person. The pictures are very deceiving . I do not recommend this if you are looking for a big bag .,0
2,"Doesn't lay right,  never even wore it and got ride of it.",0
1,Printed patch; not embroidered,0
5,No issues with them on.,1
4,"Beautiful look, fit, and price!",1
5,very warm for going out in the snow we get in Nebraska.,1
1,Way to small given the sizing. Can't even get it up on my feet.,0
1,"I purchased this to wear on Veterans Day to show support for our military, past, and present.  When I tried to pin it on, the clasp would not catch, tried again, still would not catch correctly and the petal top was so heavy it just drooped.  On the third try, it just fell apart and dropped to the floor. This is truly a very poorly made item and sad to know that such poor workmanship is made supposedly to honor such great Americans.  I tried to post a pic but it would not work",0
1,"The glasses came in an envelope not a box not a case, so they traveled across the US being beaten and roughed up. They don’t have the siLver LOCS logo on the sides of the glasses frame. These are totally not worth buying and amazons shipping regulations need to change as well. Not impressed.",0
5,Loved it,1
5,"I bought these tights because it is impossible to find skin toned thermal fleece lined tights for black women, and was hoping I could get away with this looking like pantyhose over my skin. I bought the grey, the black (pictured) and the coffee. I can just barely get away with it, but if I were any darker it probably wouldn't work. They aren't the thickest pair of fleece tights I have (I get cold very easily), but they're reasonably warm.",1
5,"This is exactly what I was looking for.. Light, flowing and comfortable... Love it!",1
5,The shirt is very nice quality. I purchased it as a gift and my niece loved it.,1
4,would have given 5 stars but instead of 2 key chains one was a necklace & just had to re order 1 only & pay again<br /> I did not contact seller though,1
5,These Earrings are so expensive looking.  They are a comfortable fit.  Top quality for the price.,1
1,"I used this strap for one day. I attached it to my wallet and wore it as a wrist strap on two errands, and by the end, the grommet that held the whole thing together had broken. I got what I paid for, and it wasn’t even worth the hassle of returning.",0
3,so these were pretty good for the price .. great quality .. nice case and everything you would expect from DG ... on thing my client complained about was that they were a tad too big for her face ... but other than that .. they were pretty nice ..,0
3,"Super soft and comfy. I have wide, swollen feet due to pregnancy and my usual size still fit perfect. I actually wore these to my baby shower.<br /><br />Rated 3 stars because more than once while I'm walking, the front folds over and I trip over them.",0
1,Cant believe you thought 500 grams of gold was 200$ in the first place,0
1,Junk,0
5,These pants are fabulous. The material is high quality and I always get compliments when I wear them!,1
2,The fit is good and it looks good from afar but it's a really cheap material. Light and flimsy. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
2,Fits smaller than the size shows.,0
5,All good nice fit and wear,1
2,It’s see through. Would make for a perfect tie dye project dress.,0
5,This for incredibly well and was way better sewn than I expected is a sturdy but lighter material.,1
3,There ok they could be a little more sturdy I’ll be using them for my kids shared birthday part (Mickey/Minnie) all kids will get a pair,0
4,Hat was a little stiff but overall a great fit and look!,1
5,This skirt is a great wrap around for the beach. Very comfortable and fits as expected,1
5,very cute,1
1,No. No. No. This was entirely too small. The top has zero support and you could see my nipples through the mesh inserts on the top. The bottom fit well I guess but it was just awkward. The mesh parts just look strange.,0
5,Very nice looking very elegant but a little tight on the waist I would prefer a little loose .,1
3,Very nice and little things out  top. But nice style,0
2,"After about 4 months of use on alternate days, the elastic at the waist is completely gone.",0
1,"broke within 2 days of having it, save your money.",0
1,too small,0
5,GF loved it!,1
3,It looks great and is vey quiet BUT my watch is over an hour off after eight hours on the winder. So I'm not going to recommend anyone to buy one.,0
3,Too wide in the waist. Very thin.,0
3,"Cheap, as expected. The front hangs low and kind of makes it look like a maternity shirt.",0
4,My four year old daughter LOVES these shoes.  She is very picky about how shoes feel on her feet and instantly declared that these were comfortable. She normally wears a 10/10.5 and had to go a size up to an 11.5.  She has gotten so many compliments in public about how cute her shoes are.  The only reason that I took a star off is because the shoes keep getting untied any my daughter doesn't know how to tie her shoes yet.  I have double knotted them and they still manage to become untied.  I'm thinking of either sewing the tie/bow in place or using fabric glue.,1
5,"What can I say about a jeweler's loupe. It magnifies as expected.<br /><br />Then, again, it is very solidly made.  Actually, for the price, I expected something cheap.  That's what I was paying for.  Cheap ...<br /><br />Yet, it is very well made, and well worth considerably more than the price paid.  A rare gem (no pun intended) in this age.",1
5,"Not irritating, and the dangling part stays on pretty good! They did fall off after a few months from getting hooked on my jeans or belt but that was my fault :)",1
1,This looked like something you would get out of a gumball machine.,0
2,Not large. Way too small,0
1,"It wasn't the right material, I didn't like how cheap it looked. I returned it.",0
3,"I bought this after the stock band broke on my charge 4.  It is nice quality, and fit well on to the unit.<br /><br />But I had a hard time getting it to fit well.  If I got it tight enough for the sleep tracking to work, I'd wake up with a sore wrist and a deep red trench where the band was.  If I loosened it so my wrist wouldn't hurt, I'd wake up through the night whenever it would slip around into an awkward angle.  I'm a big guy, so when I needed to take it off, I had to actually decouple on of the ends, because there wasn't enough slack in the band to let me slip it off my wrist.<br /><br />I liked the style and the construction of this band, it just wasn't what I needed from a band.",0
3,Dress was ok but fit extremely small.,0
5,"I bought these for my daughter for Homecoming, it’s her birthstone color. They are STUNNING!",1
5,"So cute, my son loved them!",1
5,"This is a beautiful watch and comes packaged like a designer watch in a gift bag in nice box on a pillow.  It is sleek, simple and elegant.  It comes with the tool to take out links so, I had my husband take a couple out for me.  Now it fits perfectly and can be worn with a casual outfit or dressed up.  I really like the Fold-over-clasp-with-hidden-double-push-button.  It is easy to put on and take off with one hand.  It is easy to set the time and the date.  Stainless steel so it will last and not irritate your skin.  Beautiful watch and a great value.<br />Sample provided for testing and review.",1
2,"The look and style of this boot is beautiful however, it has its flaws. Boots run a bit small. I wear a 7 and purchased a 7. They were too snug even with thin socks. I’d suggest going a size up but since there are no half sizes, you run the risk of the being too big. Also, if you’re looking for comfort, these aren’t the way to go. They are very clunky even with the sleek design and they don’t feel very stable when walking. I tried them at gone hoping I could live with the flaws but for the price , I decided to return then and try a different brand.",0
4,"I thought this was super cute - great quality for the price.  Unfortunately, I returned it because it was a bit shorter than I wanted.  I would recommend it though.",1
5,It’s super cute and fits perfectly with these red shoes with pearls that I bought. Love it!,1
3,Too big didn’t feel like I was getting the necessary quality of the mask,0
3,"I normally wear a size 3X. I first ordered this sweater in size 3X, it was huge. I sent it back and tried a size 1X. It was still too big. I then tried a size Large and it fit, but I felt it looked like a maternity top on me, so I sent it back. It had nice soft material. It was pretty and good quality.<br />This sweater comes from a company called Roaman's. I realized after I bought this sweater that I had bought a coat from this same company before and had the same problem, where I bought a size 3X and ended up with a size Large. I didn't check their size chart when I bought it.",0
3,I like the style.,0
5,Beautiful watch😘,1
3,Very mediocre and cheap looking.  Not horrible for the price.  But not anything I would wear or gift.  There was nothing wrong with it and it looks like the pics.,0
3,"I’m pleased with the fit of the dress, however there is a snag in the fabric about thigh high... not very visible but I can feel it. I’m afraid it could turn into a problem down then road... should I return?",0
5,El zapato es perfecto,1
3,"Very cute, but this runs quite large. It was baggy and did not fit at all like the same size, same brand in other styles of jumpsuit. One would expect consistency.",0
5,"Comfortable, lightweight. Love em!",1
5,Perfect for lounging and being lazy,1
3,This shirt is small for the size stated.  I had to give it away.,0
5,Love the yoga socks excellent grip on my yoga mat.,1
5,"Highly recommend these pants, they are buttery soft, have a good amount of compression all over and gives me a slimming figure. Also squat proof! Will be buying in the other colors!  I work in a warehouse and have to constantly squat and I have never had a pair of undergarments show",1
2,I am an XL so I ordered an XL.  It did not fit. I passed it to my 11 yr old daughter that wears a Large in girl size. I ain't going to lie it was a cute shirt.,0
1,Request to return because top was too small never heard back from seller so I now have a top that’s too small that I can’t wear or return,0
5,Very good product. Will purchase again when needed.,1
5,I got this hoodie for my grandson and he loves it.,1
5,Awesome cuff links! Well made. I have not had any chipping/flaking in the design.,1
5,Very cute piece. Looks like you would have spent more.,1
3,"The necklace did not come with the Tree of Life charm as advertised. I have asked them to send it. Otherwise, the beads themselves are nice.",0
5,"I will be getting more, but in the next bigger size.",1
5,"This is easily one of my favorite samples I have been sent from Ann Arbor. Along with it fitting how I want a shirt to fit, I enjoy watching people read the shirt and try to figure out the play on words. You can wear it out without feeling scummy for having an inappropriate shirt on.<br />I recently had a chance to review several different sample t-shirts from Ann Arbor T-Shirt Co. Each shirt is a 100% cotton blend and has a soft and comfortable feel. I like a thicker t-shirt as a preference and usually the softer t-shirts do not offer the durable thick feel I look for. This blend for each of these shirts has found a nice balance in soft and thick. The shirts fit snug around the neck and shoulders and relax as it tapers down the arms. The tail of the shirt also tapers a small amount and creates a more fitted feel without getting tight. The screen printing is very pliable and held up to a first wash very well! That first wash also did not shrink any of the shirts in question.<br />Again, I did receive these samples at a discount (Not Free) in exchange for my opinion. I was not asked to provide a positive review! If this helps hit the Yes button, please.",1
1,Too small.,0
1,I wear a size 7 so I ordered a half size up since the size 8 has been sold out for a long time and these shoes are TINY and narrow and there is no give to them at all. I was going to return them but the return date was they had to receive them back on the 29th well I didn’t even get them till the 29th so yeah thanks for the crappy experience!,0
1,"1. Comfort: poor, potentially needs time to stretch and adjust, yet based on design it might not work as will not stay as needed.<br />2. Sound: awful, like the cheap headphones given out by airlines 15 years ago without the over the head band.<br />3. controls are not trivial when wearing the hat.<br />4. Idea - great, yet idea by itself is not a product. Needs work.<br />Every physical part needs improvement, price way overrated, greed is the only thing that is exercised successfully. Will try the hat again since return is by end of January. Will give it another chance before potential return.<br />Great idea, very disappointing execution.",0
1,Muy mala cálida al mes estaba roto,0
5,"Really fast shipping! The calf sleeve seems to be high quality and the fit and compression, for me, is perfect. Exactly what I was looking for and I like the way it looks.",1

5,"This is perfect! Fit just as expected, comfortable  and soft!",1
3,"Very small,more for a female or child",0
5,Very cute monokini! Material is thick and comfortable. I didn't have to worry about anything falling out of place. It fits as expected. I ordered a Large but this made my body look great. The front covered my belly well and I thought it made me look slim. I always get compliments when I wear it!,1
1,They do not stay up on ear.,0
2,For what it cost it should have been metal.  Cheap plastic,0
5,Cute and light.,1
2,"The quality was wonderful...but it was several sizes smaller than it was marked as being, so i had to return it.",0
2,"Very cute socks, but the size is way off!  These are suitable for children's feet, not adult-sized feet.  The product should say Children's not say Women's in it's name.",0
4,Fit as expected.,1
4,"I love these types if shirts for working out. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but they're a good fit and very comfortable",1
2,So disappointed on this one. As soon as I opened the package it smelled like chemicals. I was afraid to try it on. Once I got passed the smell I could not get the shorts pass my thighs. Truly mislabeled.,0
5,Great glasses,1
5,"I love my new everyday watch!  It is easy to read and because it is black and stylish, it matches everything in my wardrobe.",1
3,It fell apart.,0
5,The product is of good quality and durable. I like the size it’s not to big or small.,1
1,"cheap, poor quality",0
4,This stretches enough to adjust to anyone's neck. My only problem is that the pendant fell off after a week of wearing.,1
5,"Love it! Perfect length, fabric is comfy and not see through at all!",1
5,"Just the snap I needed to secure a two way radio microphone cord to my webbing radio strap. The swivel is a tight fit to the base but swivels easily, the spring clip is easily opened with one hand, everything you'd expect from Ykk.",1
5,Great product! As good as I expected,1
5,"This is perfect for layering and warmer weather. Material is a little thin, but not see through.<br /><br />The dress is short, hits me on the same part of my thigh as shown in the picture. I'm 5'5 38DDD 185 lbs. The pockets don't add too much bulk to the hips.<br />I paid around $17, I think that is a little high, but that is a lot cheaper than similar dressed at places like Urban Outfitters and American Eagle",1
5,"Nice material, not too thin not too thick.  I'm short so it's a bit on the long side for me. But nothing a little fold cant fix.",1
1,Only for A/B cup girls,0

2,Ordered for my little girl for my wedding (flower girl) looks very cheap :( the tutu separates and bunches up and  you can easily see the slip underneath,0
3,Well my daughter got this for Christmas and was super excited because it's pretty. She fell asleep with it in her nose and when she woke up it was broken.,0
2,You might want to get a size bigger than what you normally are because they run small,0
3,A little to big and some where heavy,0
4,I am 5'6&#34; tall. All my weight is in the middle. Very nice fit however the cups in the chest are ridiculous. They are about the size if a silver dollar. I took them out and replaced them,1
1,This sports bra is very stiff and makes a strange 1950s boob shape. It's not good quality. I don't recommend.,0
5,The little embroidered designs all over these jeans are super cute. They are comfortable and fit well. I love that they have no buttons or zippers. Makes them easy for my daughter to deal with at school.,1
5,"I absolutely loved this dress…it runs small and would be more flattering on a smaller person.  There is some stretch, the color, the length we’re all perfect.  The material was very comfortable, the dress just runs on the smaller side.",1

4,Good quality.,1
5,"Perfect to feel dressed to run to car, take trash to dumpster, grab mail. Just a tad short for me and I am 5""3"" but senior so dont like my knees showing.  If it was longer, I would wear it anywhere.  Love that it has pockets too.  Probably going to order a few more.",1

1,Broke immediately upon attempting to wear. Very thin and cheap material. Do not waste your money.,0
5,Good product,1
3,The shirt isn't a woman's cut and is quite itchy even after washing and drying. The purple color isn't quite as expected and the size runs large.,0

5,My favorite ring. Fits well and matches my watch.,1
5,It has become my fav. Workout shoe!,1
3,Its cute on. Quality isn't the greatest but not bad for little ones and not bad for the price,0
5,Super comfy and casual. People ask me though if I went to Harvard and I just explain I majored in dumb questions. Harvard tri County 😂,1
3,"I have to admit the buckle on this belt is nice. Very good finish. The size is true as well. Where I have an issue is with the ""Italian leather"" advertising, but nothing on the belt or the box says anything about Italy.<br /><br />I've used leather belts all up and down the line... from Gucci (used), Coach, all the way down to Dickies and no-names. This leather is above average. It's not some fine craft or anything. It's stamped leather and kind of stiff with just an okay finish. I would not normally be so harsh, but to trumpet Italian leather and send this, it's deserved.",0
3,Small fitting. Does not fit 20y/o sister well. Looks nice but fitting a problem.,0
1,DID NOT LIKE AT ALL..,0

5,perfect,1
5,I recently got a spin bike and lord have mercy these shorts are a god send. There is nothing comfortable about a spin bike seat and after a good 30 - 45 minutes you'd rather be dead. The shorts make my tush feel great! They are super stretchy and the padding on the inside is very thick. It's thick but doesn't really stick out from the pants. It doesn't look like you're wearing a diaper because it really is isolated to the crotch area.,1
1,"I was VERY disappointed with this scarf.  It does not look at all like the example featured in photo on Amazon.  Photo shows a light blue scarf with cute little sheep design print.  Scarf I received, today, is a very dark blue and the sheep imprint doesn't even look like sheep!  Because of the dark blue fabric, the black face and legs of the sheep don't even show up -- so it just looks like a bunch of white puffy clouds on the scarf!  I'm going to see if I can easily get a refund and will send it back.  But since it shipped all the way from China... I have my doubts about the process being very quick or easy.",0
5,Good quality hat.,1
3,"Im a little disappointed in this. I was super excited for its arrival. I got this to replace a very similar coat that had lost its zipper.<br /><br />Cons: it appears that what looks like front pockets with a snap to ensure its closure is actually a huge fake...with nothing to snap to (pictured), there is a small side pocket there but sadly theres no closure for it at all. Im actually majorly bummed about that. As a mom of 3 I constantly have things I need to put in pockets and it would've been nice to have that peace of mind that they actually stayed in the darn pocket.<br /><br />Pros: the faux fur around the hood is not obnoxiously thick to the point that you feel like you can't see (pictured). The color (navy blue) is exactly as pictured. Its not faded or darker in coloration.<br /><br />Other observations I noticed but dont recall reading in the description are...the faux fur lining on the inside is just around the chest area, it doesnt continue on inside the jacket sleeves (pictured). The faux fur is SUPER SOFT. I was worried it might come out and stick to my clothes but I havent had that issue. The jacket itself seems like a nice in between...it doesnt seem too thick for fall weather but its not so thin that it wouldnt hold warmth in winter. I also havent felt like I needed to rip it off while driving because I get overheated or because its so bulky I feel like the state puff marshmellow man trying to drive. It DOES NOT have a draw string around the hooded area but it DOES have one around the waist.",0
1,It ripped on second wear.,0
3,Really small jewelry,0
3,"These are cute, but the size is strange for me. I'm usually a small in shorts like this (any size up would have been way too baggy), but the elastic on the waist is way too tight for me. Bummer because they are super cute!",0
5,The fit is great. Very comfortable.,1
2,Was a kids medium. Needed a lady medium,0
5,I love this dress. It is comfortable and flattering. Nice for work and good quality.,1
5,"A bit overpriced but no regrets, giving it five stars for looks, feel, and fit.  Too fancy to be a prayer cap, but I didn't want a kufi, anyway.",1
4,It last.,1
4,What I got was a solid black dress. This dress fits well and looks nice. My husband commented on how good it looked on me. I guess all the weight I have been losing is paying off. I will have something nice to wear when we go out.,1
2,Water can get inside,0
1,Pretty earrings but very large. They would look pretty on my Christmas tree. I sent them back.,0
1,"This is about as stretchy as an underarmor shirt. Next to zero compression, absolutely useless.",0
5,In love!!! Cute. Girly. Spacious!! Perfect size and super comfortable to wear. Didn’t care too much for the “purse” strap but you can easily take it off.,1
1,Not for everyday use... broke after a week.,0
4,Its nice and exactly as pictured. My only problem is lenght. It should be a little longer. For adult woman it will be too tight. other than that its good choice and price.,1
4,Great bag just not for me,1
2,Material is crappy i got what i paid for,0
5,Super cute fits nicely,1
2,The material was very thin and you could see my underwear. I returned the dress for a refund.,0
4,"Wife loves this bra. Very comfortable, fits correctly. Very high quality. Comfortable all day long.",1
3,"The fit is as expected, but the fabric is thinner than expected. I knew that it was a light fabric, but it’s see-through and very revealing. I bought these thinking—from the photo—that they could be worn for work, but they will be around the house only pants.",0
3,Not real excited about it,0
5,These gloves are thick and comfortable (like wearing a quilt for your hands). These held up in 15 degree weather with 40mph winds. The waterproofing is only on the palm of the glove which is fine and it works great. The touch screen on this tricky and really works best if youre just trying to scroll. 9.5/10 and i would recommend these,1
3,Nice skirt. But I need a bigger size and this skirt is very short. Will need to wear thighs/leggings underneath this skirt. And I HATE the return options. They need more options to choose from. For those who's unable to drop off a return package. Smh...,0
3,Lunch box doesn’t stay on backpack well.,0
5,I like everything about this bracelet.  It matches my garnet ring perfectly.,1
5,I love this I get compliments all the time!,1
2,Thought they were good glasses for the price until the frame broke within the first week.  Returned.,0
1,Wore bracelet a half dozen times and silver wearing off. Not worth $19.99.,0
1,"I like the colors, but I wear a 2x ordered a 3x and it still doesn't fit right. The reviews stated it ran small but geez I should have ordered a 4x ..hmm",0
5,I bought this for work so I didn't have to pull out my phone to check the time every time I passed out meds for work. It is comfortable and super cute!!,1
4,Nice dress for the price. It's definitely more on the casual side. Comfortable and can be flattering.,1
5,Love these earrings,1
3,"They smell terrible out of the package - DO NOT WASH WITH ANY OTHER LAUNDRY.  I ended up washing the socks 3 times with vinegar and laundry soap, just to get the horrible chemical smell out of the socks.",0
5,Works great for pulling my boots off,1
5,"I use it every other week to maintain my husband hat,",1
3,"I have a few issues with this shirt which may not be issues for other buyers.<br /><br />If you want this shirt to stop at your hip, and you are over 5’4”, it will not do this in front. Your stomach will be exposed unless you pair it with high-waisted pants. It is longer in back, but it will not cover your bottom.<br /><br />The cut-outs are nice, but are only fray-checked with a glue, so this shirt is unlikely to survive multiple washings...the fabric is very thin, so great for hot weather, but also slightly see-through.<br /><br />All in all, decent for the price and very cute, just cut for a much shorter body than mine (5’8” for reference).",0
1,"I wrote a review before but it obviously didn't get published. I give ZERO stars for delivery (it took over a month) and quality. It is 2 very thin layers. I was going to use for Christmas pictures, thankfully it did not arrive in time as it wouldn't have worked anyway because it is so thin and cheaply made. Look elsewhere.",0
5,"Versatile, flattering, comfortable, well-made dress. Dress it up or down. I bought the floral pattern in every color.",1
5,"Good quality vest. Nice material and it fit my husband nicely. The adjuster in the back is a bit wonky, it works though.",1
5,Perfect dress!,1
5,"My friend had to get this for her husband, his fav line of best Xmas movie ever!  Merry Christmas everyone!",1
4,Really nice,1
4,"Runs small. Order the next size up. Other than that, it's very cute.",1
5,Very cute dress and quality is also good,1
2,"Enormous and no shape. Bought another dress from this brand that was adorable, but sent this one back.",0
4,"My daughter loved these. They were easy to put on for me, but my husband has small fingers and it was hard for him to help our daughter. We didn’t think we would get much wear from them, but surprisingly enough she’s worn them maybe twice a week with no issues.",1
4,"Would have give 5 stars if the piece that removes links did not twist and break. Luckily, I had some random tools at home to rectify this and was able to remove and reconnect links as needed.",1
1,Sizing is way too small,0
5,Feel very comfortable got 38 a little tight but after I wear them a while they should stretch if you want something different then these are it great for the summer very happy!,1
3,"These are like not so great padded underwear. The sizing is strange. The material is strange. They are just a little weird. Maybe that's because they are unisex and men and women are just not built the same, especially THERE. You know what I mean?.<br /><br />Anyway, my husband is making them work, but I'm sure he'll be looking for another pair, as these are just a little too generic.",0
3,"Small was too tight and medium was too loose. Hard to get a good fit because the fit is not adjustable. Returned and got the Switchback cap instead, which I like much better.",0
5,"Love it! Perfect fit, loose, airy. Great for workouts in this summer heat!",1
1,"Terrible material, super cheap",0
5,Very realistic and compliments my other real gold  jewelries.,1
2,The pants are not made for men muscular men over 5”8.,0
5,Very sturdy and nice looking.,1
5,These shoes look great in person I can’t wait to wear them I got black and now I have ordered red The red ones will be great for the holidays Love Love Love😍,1
5,"Love these! They fit great, feel great, and aren't cheap looking! I ordered a size medium. I'm 5'5 155lbs.",1
5,Holds everything together very nicely. Makes organization in a backpack very easy and saves me time fumbling around looking for what I need,1
3,"Updating this review after one week of wearing.  Still love the look, but the plain ones will not stay closed.  They just will not click closed and I am very frustrated.  I may have to return them.  But, I love the ones with the stones.<br /><br />Just received them yesterday so I don't know how they will hold up, but they look great and I love how they hug the ear and are small and delicate looking, not big and chunky.",0
3,"I bought two Bondi bands. I was excited after reading  some of the reviews. However, after receiving it I was disappointed by the quality: thin,  light, flimsy. Material feels cheap for the price.",0
5,"I ordered these ADOME Women’s Bandeau Bikini sets of 2 pieces and she says she does like the light blue color, the 2- way wear design and the styling of the adjustable slender and removable shoulder straps, and the padded cups. Our daughter says that these sets of swimsuits fit her pretty well and she says that they are comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off as needed. She says she has been wearing them for swimming, and lounging around the pool for the past 2 weeks and she says so far, so good, as the bra holds quite well and does not slip and the she likes that the bra does not come with wire and she likes the high cut leg openings of the underwear.<br />Our daughter says that she likes that these bikini swimsuit sets’ fabric texture is soft and smooth and gentle on her skin. They appear to be great value for bucks, considering the quality and the price point. I would recommend them.",1
2,"It's too big. I wear size 12-14 in women size. Ordered cl, it's too big.",0
5,"My 21 month old twin boys love elmo, they have elmo games, elmo toys, elmo chairs, elmo dishes, elmo toothbrushes and now an elmo room! We went to BRU to pick out a ""big boy BED"", but they refused to have their cool stock car beds without Elmo too! They were running all over the store with those elmo sheets (almost took them too, but good thing I realized!!) Their room was a sports theme origionally so Elmo fit right in. We too found the comforter to be a bit hard and scratchy at first, but after we washed it, it was fine. We got the pillow case pictured with both of ours (maybe some people just get duds?) and after washing it COLD both times (not warm as the directions said) with those color catchers, the whole set turned out soft, durable and bright! ***To those of you who recieve the red pillow case, do NOT wash it with the rest of the bedding, as it seems most of the washing problems are for the red pillow case users*** It fits perfectly on their crib mattresses and it looks so nice with the sports theme and their red/blue stock car beds! My boys are eager to sleep in their rooms because elmo is there too, and to all you other parents of Elmo fanatics, I know this bedding set will make all the difference!",1
1,cannot seem to hook it by myself always have to have someome help me the latch is not easy.,0
1,"The large doesnt fit and the colour is not what i expected ,... there was an issue with the zipper as well.",0
3,They look really great but are a bit uncomfortable.,0
2,It is too clingy to be an A line dress. It also runs small. Fabric feels like plastic. It doesn't breath. Really disappointed.,0
5,Better than the original lenses.  I love them and highly recommend.,1
5,excellent,1
5,"Got so many compliments on this skirt. Looks amazing! I think it's made big, but I would still order your actual size. It leaves room for comfort.",1
2,"a little too small, not true to size",0
3,"A little snug and there's no give in the crotch, so there are already seams giving way from bending and squatting.",0
5,Fit great. Coloring was so pretty. I even ordered another one in a different color.,1
1,Anytime you try clean the lens they pop out. When taking them off the lens pop out. I only have one lens after wearing once.  Not worth the price at all.,0
2,"Im 6,3 200pd long torso and this tank was just about showing belly, i order a 2x could not believe  it was that small.material felt good tho.sending back.i like my shirts 2or3 inches below  belt line.",0
5,Beautiful bracelet - love the donation to different charities that Alex & Ani sponsors on several bracelets this one is Make-A-Wish,1
1,Way too small. I don't like it at all. It barely has any weight.,0
5,Good product just what I was inspecting,1
1,I read the reviews and should have listened.  This hat was in a warehouse in china for way too long.  It smelled so bad of must and  mold that after an hour the room smelled of mold.  Additionally it is a cone head hat!  After washing and line drying It barely fits my two year old neice.  I also bought another one from the same company that I will be adding this same review to.,0
5,"Thanks, just what I needed.",1
2,They left my package outside while it was raining first off but the shoe box and shoes were dry I guess. Then I come to open then and they're bigger than my whole arm. But the looked nice,0
2,Very cheap quality but they look nice,0
3,Beautiful but runs very small!,0
3,Nice slippers but too small :(,0
5,Love these Excellent sunglasses 🕶,1
3,"Probably too thin to wear for bike shorts, but great for under things.",0
5,This hat has nice material the embroidering is really nice and it fits well.,1
5,Real deal. Got it authenticated by Nordstrom.,1
1,"The material is like paper thin. The bottoms could be used as panties but I think when wet they will be completely see through. The top is not anything more than a ruffle to hang on your body. Nothing about it will adhere to you to keep it in place if swimming.<br /><br />The small would fit a woman size small.<br /><br />this may be better suited for ""play"" on an adult. But definitely not anything for a kid and most definitely not swimwear. Returning this and hoping for a refund.",0
1,Basically plastic. Cute in concept. Not to be worn on actual human hands.,0
5,Was very excited to here my sister wants one also.Fashionable and sterling silver.Great choice.,1
5,Fits as expected<br />Arrived on time,1
5,Prettier in real life than in the picture!,1
4,"I think this dress is cute for a younger age, not for me. The pleated stitching  is not comfortable, but okay to wear around the house. I did like the color and quality. Good price and fast service.",1
3,Beautiful jacket but for a large it fits like a medium,0
1,I️received a package with nothing in it. I️ didn’t want to put one star but I️ had to rate the product.,0
1,They swear they're giving you the US human woman sizes that we're used to...I assumed this was made in China  but thought if I followed their size chart it'd still work..bc it says exactly that..<br />But I ordered a 42C & even if it would have fit my apparently gigantic rib cage (which it did NOT) it wouldn't have mattered b/c the supppsedly size C cups were NOT C's!! Maybe A's...not sure what the hell they're thinking advertising this in my plus size woman's bra searches...but they need to be stopped or they need a SERIOUS conversion chart lesson!!!,0
2,The shirt is a very thin cotton and it runs at least 2 sizes smaller than the size.,0
3,It was amazon fault it was the person her calf was too big.LOL,0
2,Extremely short,0
3,Dress is cute.,0
4,"Finally, a flannel nightgown that’s not paper thin. A little big but that’s great for a nightgown.",1
5,Love it,1
1,I can't speak for others but the shirt I received print was horrible almost like a kid did it I had 3 pair of shoes that was clear on the shirt the rest of them had missing parts all over and super faded shirt I received was definitely not worth 6he money,0
5,"I'm one that generally leaves the house so quickly, I tend to forget my wallet, keys, mask, or phone. With so many items, I wanted something that wasn't going to add to much bulk to my pants or limit my purchase of cargo pants. I turned to this as I've had similar ones in past travels. The best way to describe this would be a fanny pack to comes up to your chest when swung around. It's very well thoughout, you can open the compartments without the worry about items falling out from the sides like other bags. There's a niuce lanyard to attach your keys so even when needed, you can pull them out and quickly find them by the bright red lace attached. There's two compartment in the bag, both of which have little sections to hold items like a parking pass, or other cards you may need readily accessible. I went for a 2 mile walk to test it out and found to to be a very well designed bag. Little discomfort as you'd expect from a sling especially if you're like me and carries a water bottle with them. If your a daily commuter and want something you can pack items on the go, I strongly suggest you give this bag a try",1
3,Beautiful design but the stems on back are very short. I'm afraid to wear them. Don't want to lose one.,0
5,Work great for 5 year old,1
4,"it's so cute, but runs small, you should definitely get a size bigger, the material is thin.",1
1,"And the criss-cross lines that are shown as cold shoulder, the strings were included, I guess for me to sew on the shirt  Ridiculous and so cheap.",0
1,The straps are literally like 10” too long. It’s useless without being re-sewn,0
2,Started to tarnish quickly but with the price I really should complain,0
1,i bought this product to dress up like miss frizzle from the series the magic school bus. after recieving i realized it was two sizes too small and was unable to make the garmet work for the occassion. However i was impressed with the material it was made from and the design was nice.,0
5,"I bought several to for gift giving, great quality!",1
5,"I purchased two of these bow ties for the ring bearers in my wedding. It was way cheaper to buy these than to rent some. These ties are a nice, quality satin, and look much more expensive than they are. I was very pleased when these arrived. I think that they look even nicer than pictured, and I did not expect such a quality product. YAY for happy surprises.",1
5,"I love this bracelet is very pretty and pics dont make justice, spiritual or not, is delicate and shines pretty well!!",1
1,"Caming diferent color and  duty with  black  spots  and smell  wired, I don't  like  it",0
5,A bit tooo long,1
3,"Too small, too cheap. Very disappointed",0
3,"Very thin pants, not at all for cold weather...",0
1,"It says Ray on the label, but it is some nasty synthetic material that felt very hot on my body. I am very disappointed, and I wish they would not lie about what a product is made out of. I don’t know what the polkadot ones are like, this was for the blue flower one it is very pretty, just a nasty material.",0
5,"Bought it in the taupe and the blue and LOVE both.  I'm 5'2 136 lbs and I did have to have it hemmed but it was so worth it!  Love the pockets, too!",1
1,This item is falsely pictured . The cape is not long all the way to mid calf as pictured on the model. I am 5’2 and it’s a mini cape not at all what I wanted . It is only back length,0
5,Love this dress!,1
1,"Wanted to like this was hesitant<br />Cheap not flattering, poor material .  For price .. definitely can do better would return if I knew after 2 washes on very gentle & followed instructions was already falling apart sincerely wanted this to work",0
4,It was amazing but the chain looks kind of  cheap and it's sort of heavy,1
4,"Love the bag, but I gave it 4 stars because I didn’t like the velcro closure and it was a little too small.",1
1,Cheap looking cheap quality 🙁,0
2,Too small.,0
3,Not as large as I thought,0
5,Love these jeans. The rips aren't as intense as the picture shows which is fine. I immediately tossed them in the washer and dryer because they looked as if they may be a little big. The tummy and butt area are quite roomy still. So I ordered another pair and sized down and those were a bit more snug without drying. Over all. The slight difference in sizing isn't a big deal. They suite the purpose as to what I bought them for. Love these jeans anyway. They aren't too heavy of a denim and just over all a great pair of jeans for the price. Quick ship is always a plus also. One little con is the fact that they have a smell to them. I'm hoping that fades out  the more I wash them.,1
2,Sizing is a bit off and the hem was torn upon opening package.,0
5,"It’s a nice wallet, it’s a little blocky and stuff but hopefully as it gets broken it that will lessen.",1
5,Great summer shirt,1
5,I love this necklace and the company that makes them as well. This one is my favorite. I highly recommend LKS Originals Jewelry and all their great products. I will be buying more of these awesome pendant necklaces soon!,1
5,Love these shorts! They are so comfortable and hold my tummy in. I love the pockets too!,1
5,"they're great! I got them a lot sooner than expected, and they fit so comfy. love them!",1
3,Kinda cheap looking on the metal parts up close and not as colorful as I hoped. I have small/ medium wrists and these are too big even tightened all the way up. I’ll probably wear them as anklets.,0
1,"These are very cheap quality, they came broken with one of the white stones missing. Save yourself the time of having to return them, listen to the reviews & don’t buy em! I wish I listened to the reviews",0
5,The fit was perfect and they were very soft and comfortable. They also washed well.,1
5,needed a simple but elegant bag for a black tie wedding.  this is perfect,1
1,Absolutely terrible . The teeth are not where they are usually are. They pull the tie even when you place it normally. Price dictates the cheap . Just go to josabank and pay the 20 dollars each,0
3,I found the straps to be uncomfortable,0
5,"Wish I had a picture of us wearing our peace necklaces. I buy them for my really close friends that remind us of our unity, love, and hippy days. The symbol is friendship. I need to buy two more because my friends love them. Great gifts of friendship!",1
5,"Liked the glasses but they looked too small for my 4 year old's head.  They were not too tight around her head/ears, but did not look wide enough on her face.",1
5,I seriously never write reviews but I had to do one for these cute boots! I got them for my son and they are very true to size. They got him perfect and the fuzzy lining goes all the way though. I bought him some from carters that were more expensive and they are horrible and thin and not warm at all.<br /><br />These ones are awesome ! They are warm and just so cute. I'm very happy !,1
5,The product was as the description.,1
5,Amazing my mom has cancer an is.always cold. She has thanked me so much for this an wears it everyday!!,1
2,"I can manage no arch support, but the stated size 7 is too small for my size 7 foot. A little narrow too. Have returned the sandals.",0
3,"I buy lots of 82 Days skirts and use them as dresses (I am short). I was hoping I could do that with this skirt as well. Sadly, the fit and material were lacking and it was shorter than anticipated. Would make a cute skirt on a not curvy girl. Not for me.",0
2,Can't set the time keeps flashing,0
5,These heart-shaped glasses are adorable!  They fit perfectly and got here fast.  The price is the best.  Thank you - I love them!,1
1,"It Came broken, don’t even bother",0
2,no lumunance,0
5,EVERYONE LOVES THIS RING.,1
5,nice,1
3,Very thin material . Also needs more depth.,0
5,Fits well and looks exactly like the picture.,1
2,"The arms are smaller than normal, I have many smart wool vests that fit perfectly. This is very tight in the arms",0
2,"They came in a package but didn't fit the same at all. They came quickly I just wish they fit. Ones too small and ones too big. But the gray pair is at least comfy, that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of one.",0
1,"I bought these thinking they would be better quality than the other brands. This time I should have chosen quantity over quality. While cute, they barely stick to my daughters ears. If she had her way, the whole pack would have been gone after one day.",0
3,Aspecto económico en la tela,0
5,"I looked at a lot of shoulder rigs, and I think for anything like this price, this is the most flexible.  I need to shoot below eye level (about chest level) and this lets me do that without a hitch.  Also, if you have the rod that supports the camera set to a fairly low height, you can use it as a 2nd hand hold (I put the main hand hold at a 30 degree angle and it gives me a very solid grip).<br /><br />The whole thing feels both sold and light weight.  I'd buy it again.",1
1,Beautiful piece but not one size fits all.,0
5,My wife loved,1
1,Item is smaller than typical,0
5,it wasn’t for me. it’ a xmas gift.  will have to wait till after xmas.  i’m sure he will love it,1
5,Best yoga pants I’ve ever found.,1
1,Didn't find it,0
2,The sizing of this dress is bad. I always buy a size small and this one fits like a XS.,0
5,Great!,1
4,"I would say these fit more into the tights category than in the leggings category. They are a bit thin, so they will work fine for wearing under a dress or skirt, but I wouldn't wear them as pants.",1
4,I mistakenly thought the two parts of the bone could be place on necklace,1
4,These are fun!,1
5,I got nothing but compliments all day.  Very beautiful!,1
3,Bag is very thin. No zipper closure to sure itmes inside. One zipper to hold money.,0
5,So comfortable. And great quality!!,1
5,"Great, especially for the price and fast shipping. Thanks!",1
5,I love all my orders,1
5,Great! They have held up very well!,1
3,First order came broken but exchanged product and second was fine. Product as described.,0
5,"This was a good buy.  Very steady, it was what I wanted.",1
2,"Like that it's metal,  but the product is to high for my husband  to get under  him not good  for bed bound  person. Needs  to little  lower and  wider  would  be perfect. Right  now only using  for a back up. Little  disappointed!! Didn't  see where  it came in different  sizes?",0
4,"Girlfriend Review:<br />These are really cute! Love the key ring type, the colors and the sun and moon shapes. Not too big of an addition to my keys and gave the other one to my sister. One of the stones stones were slightly crooked with viable glue.",1
4,Very comfortable.,1
4,I was rather impressed by how fast this wig came! Wasn't expecting it until July but it came in June. It is a little scanty in the back but a little bit of styling takes care of that. I also like that it has the adjustable strap!,1
3,An overly expensive product for being plastic or poly or whatever they’re made of.,0
5,These earrings are gorgeous and I love them.  Wear them all the time.,1
4,Love these slippers my feet look like 🍕 pizza. Needs better padding on the bottom. #pizzafeet,1
2,Awkward fit. Never ended wearing.,0
2,You cannot grab an actual thorn on a rose branch like your photo indicates. It does penetrate through the glove. I feel the price is too much because of that.,0
1,The screw falls out all the time and I have gone through all of them in less then a week. Wouldnt recomend them.,0
4,Love the color and size.  Will be especially good for traveling.,1
2,It fits but it is not a zip up. It is a regular hoodie,0
2,"Not impressed,  did not fit. Cute,  maybe for a little girl who wants a charm bracelet.",0
5,Runs a little big but I love the fit. The color is actually camoflauge which I love. Plan to order several other colors,1
5,I’m pretty picky about jackets. But I love this one. The patches on it look amazing. And it fits great and keeps me pretty warm,1
3,"These are exactly what I need/ordered, but it did not come with the instructions to order the photos. If I could receive them, that would be appreciated. Definitely 5 stars if the instructions are included",0
1,Came out of the bag broken.,0
3,Tight fit but it is a slim for. Sleeves length just right!,0
5,Perfect,1
1,Very poor quality. Fell apart in about  months. I would highly suggest you keep looking for a better quality pair of boxer shorts.,0
5,The edges of the scarf are not as soft as the interior. The size is rather large but its ok. I will make it work. The color and tone is beautiful. The gradient ombre effect with a bit of shimmer is what makes this piece so dreamy,1
3,Elastic,0
1,The clasps don't connect correctly when putting in the ear. Disappointed,0
5,Love the color,1
5,Super cute for when you’re dressing up but still want to wear your watch,1
2,"Not reversible like advertised, very odd shape, way to short in back.",0
3,"I like the colorfulness, but the proportion between flowers and chain is off, the flowers are on the heavy side, makes the chain very thin and flimsy.",0
5,I love America and I love this flag!  It is very well made! I was not disappointed.,1
5,Beautifully crafted,1
2,The material is very light and see through and it didn't survive a single wash.,0
3,Love the ring buuut the wooden inner came off when in1st put it on..its wasn't glued well.. and it is brittle so I tossed it.. I just wear the ring on a different finger than I anticipated.,0
5,"This top is made of a fabric that is reveling, and it's short enough that it barely covers what's under it. My girl looks Good, Good, Good with it on!",1
5,"Was great especially for the price fit a little larger than expected. I exchanged for a medium and all was well. Wish I would have gotten pics but definitely got lots of compliments from the hubs. I wore this for date night at the beach with a high slick ponytail, sleek heels and large hoops. Will probably purchase the other color.",1
1,They're super long!! :((,0
3,It's beautiful although it's a little long and so it wraps more than I would have liked. It also is either a little loose over very tight. Don't think I'd buy again.,0
5,Super cute and they arrived very quickly.  They are a team gift for playoffs.  Would definitely recommend!,1
3,I bought this necklace for prom. It is very cute and  dainty  But comes undone very easily. Not only that but and hour into wearing it broke. Maybe I just got a default chain.,0
3,"Beanie light is very poor, actually worthless  to use, Bluetooth speakers work very well however are very bulky and hurt ears, beanie material quality is ok",0
5,Shoe is way to big for the size. Husband wears a 12 but they fit way too big! My son who wears a 14 got them!! Fit him perfectly!! He loves them!!!,1
5,"It's long, I'm short.  Other than that - PERFECT.  It was a hit, got a lot of compliments.",1
3,"For the money it's great, but as an everyday writer it's heavy and writes like a nail. I have had no problems with the pen's performance. My Lamy Safari is a better pen for everyday use , of course it cost more but not that much. .",0
5,Cute hat!!,1
5,"Love this bag, bought it to take with me whenever baby and I are out.",1
1,Sooooo small,0
5,Purchased 2 pairs of these. One for a 8yo and one for a 3yo. Both fit perfectly. Well made and look extremely comfortable.,1
1,To small cheap material,0
3,"the color was as expected, i normally get a size S but i read reviews and showed to size up so i did . i have a bit of glute and the leggings did not go up. not really a stretchy material but then again it’s not as expensive so you get what you pay",0
1,"Halloween pop up store quality... very cringey... so disappointed...<br />The clasp would pop open often, it fit properly, just a sloppy clasp.<br />Wasn’t even worth returning, i threw it in the trash with a sigh of embarrassment.",0
3,Too big I ordered a size large and I wear a size 10 dress it was way too big please order size down,0
3,"I guess this is what I ordered. But the sequence are larger than they appear in the picture. And as another review mentioned the sequence are scratchy and that would have made me uncomfortable. So I returned it. However, the dress was cute. And it fit. Just not as comfortable as I would have hoped. So again, I returned it.",0
2,"Difficult to insert and does not hold securely on my small lobe;  that was one of the reasons purchased, the size.  Will keep, too troublesome to return and not a bank breaker.",0
5,"Great suimsuit, very cute. Bought 10/12 size for my 8yo (she is built more like a 9 yo), so I would order 1 size bigger",1
5,I am in love with this dress! I usually wear a 2x for the girls and decided to go up 2 sizes based on the reviews.  I got a 4x and it fit perfectly!  I’m EXCITED to wear it on Halloween!  Go up a couple of sizes and you won’t be disappointed!,1
4,I like it. Fits well.,1
3,"Cute simple pair of earrings. They’re a little cheap.  Good for every day use, but not really formal wear.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- rose gold is pretty. And so is the opal<br />- it’s simple, can wear it daily<br /><br />Cons:<br />- it’s cheap.  The description sets the expectation though (don’t wear while spraying hair spray or taking a shower, etc.)<br />- opal isn’t too sparkly",0
2,Low quality of material; seems “rough” especially for a kid. Bought it for the cat pattern but unfortunately I would not recommend or purchase again.,0
1,My wife absolutely loved the earrings. Unfortunately after a couple of months the sliding clip hasbroken on one of them.,0
5,They feel cushy on my feet and I think they will be great for up coming hiking trip.,1
5,But I tried these on at a brick and mortar and they look good.  I ordered two more for around the house.  Oh…and I love the progressive lens.,1
1,Irritates Gums of teeth. Not recommend For adults recommend like for 10year old kids,0
1,The quality of seams is crappy and I had to fix a pleat myself so it didnt look retarded.,0
4,"Very comfortable as loungewear or yoga wear, but not suitable to high impact activities.",1
5,Love these! I'm going to buy at least half a dozen more!,1
3,great color,0
1,No way to put a chain on this wallet.,0
3,I would definitely not refer to this bag as &#34;extra large&#34; - but its super cute for just carrying my things...much to the dismay of my boyfriend,0
1,Son muy demasiado anchos sinceramente no son de mi agrado no los recomiendo,0
5,"Perfect fit, perfect weight, and just the right amount of pretty.",1
4,"These are cozy but I would have preferred them to be a bit looser. I am 5’3” and about 140 lbs. usually I wear a Medium but I bought a Large after reading reviews. So glad I did because these fit perfectly, but I actually wish they were a bit looser since I mainly bought these to throw on over my swim suit after my daughter’s swim lessons.  I should have ordered a XL.",1
1,The didnt work at all was wanting to see if they were guarenteed.,0
5,"Absolutely gorgeous show-stopping hat.  My head is big, so it's a bit of a tight fit.  It weighs practically nothing, but holds up well.  Really beautiful.",1
5,Love,1
1,Made my arm break out in bumps and hives after 24 hours,0
5,"This bag is adorable! Yes, like many reviews noted, the zippers are cheap, and the one on the coin purse broke the first time I tried to zip it, but the bag is so cute I don't care -- plus, I wasn't looking for a zippered tote to begin with so I can live without them working on this bag. I was looking for a cat-print tote that didn't scream &#34;crazy cat lady&#34; (not that that's a bad thing!) and the pattern on this is perfect. The bag is a little smaller than I expected, but it can still fit my lunch bag and a couple of books, or a change of clothes for a day at the pool, so it's fine for me.",1
5,Good seller A++++,1
2,Not a good fit and runs small.  Material is not flattering to the cut.  Cut of waist is off.,0
5,I love this bag. Perfect size to carry a lunch to work with a book and bottle of water.,1
5,Better than expected.,1
1,The material is synthetic and not 100% Cotton.,0
2,"The watchface and leather strap colors go very nicely together, but the watch feels poorly made. The time adjustment dial is located so low on the face that it digs into your wrist constantly.",0
5,Nice dress for the price.  Quality product without price.  Good for work clothes on a budget.,1
1,Material is substandard cheap felt much like that used for a child's crafting project,0
5,Thank you,1
5,great purchase!,1
3,Kind of loose around stomach areas,0
1,"After one wear, cold hand wash and hang to dry the writing and graphic starting pealing off...<br />Don't wastes your money!!!",0
2,The backs on these are absolute garbage. One wouldn't snap on at all to begin with and the rest fall off with the slightest pressure,0
2,"these slippers are total crap, they are falling apart out of the box. craftsmanship on these took a backseat to marketing and look. VERY POORLY MADE",0
1,I got the xl size<br />Way to small and I followed their  size chart,0
5,Very cute and wearable by either child or adult.,1
5,I love the fit of this dress and the length just below the knee. Material is comfortable and it is sewn well. I bought two of different patterns.,1
1,"Disappointed,  Piece is too small and the diamonds look like pastel",0
5,Loved this item.,1
5,"Not warm, all white inside, but it's good for everyday use to school. My son is 9 and this is a sz small. Over all it's fine. He's happy so momma's happy",1
5,This denim jacket is soooo cute! I love it! I ordered a medium and it's a little tight in the arms. (I have slightly bigger arms for my frame). But other than that it's great!,1
5,"I’m usually a medium but I decided to size up after reading other reviews. This thong/cheeky bodysuit is soft, stretchy & has two clips at the crotch. I purchased to wear in the bedroom paired with some thigh highs & let’s just say it was a huge hit! 😉",1
1,"This coat failed on all counts. It came with Chinese only writing on the tags... There was no filling, fiberfill, down, whatever it was to stay warm. I ordered an XL... The tag said it was an XXL... But it clearly was about the size of a medium. So incredibly disappointing.",0
1,It just didn't fit and this is the size that I regularly buy.,0
5,Super cute and absolutely fabulous! Perfect accessory for my mom & sis outfits,1
5,Fit a little big but the material is very good. And it looks same has in pic,1
5,Very pretty and my aunt loves them :),1
1,Piece of junk.  Arrived in pieces.  It should been 1/4 of a star.,0
2,"They don't stay close!!, whats the point to nice looking earrings and they are nice looking but they don't stay close...",0
5,Liked the tee but it was too small. Will reorder in a larger size.,1
5,Finally. Fingerless gloves even fir the thumb! So easy to use and gave access to all your fingers.,1
5,I ordered these for working out and they are amazing! I run and do weights in these. They are squat proof and the pockets are great. One holds my keys and the other my phone for runs/walks.,1
1,Doest off it was not the same dress as shown..<br />This dress waa completely different with many straps and an open stomach with boob pads to cover up.. strings were all broken off. I tried to fix it but I had to throw it away..  I was not happy one bit.. with getting a dress that was broke very loose and not the item I had ordered..,0
3,Need to exchange from 32 to 34<br />Good quality,0
5,Some inexpensive earings that look great and don't hurt my ears.,1
5,Great shirt,1
5,The quality of these pocket squares is outstanding. I will be purchasing more in the future.,1
3,This slipper just wasn't right for me.  It was tight and there wasn't much cushion.  It felt more like a shoe.,0
5,Beautiful real nice shirt,1
5,Just beautiful. I w'd buy these again.,1
3,I ordered my usual size and it was way too big.  I have had the same issues when ordering from Kohl’s.  Been wearing Gloria Vanderbilt for 20+ years…. Now the sizes are very off…,0
1,I like the item but it is not even close to the color shown so now i have to find one the right color,0
1,These are so super cute and the color are vibrant but sadly they are see through. So they look good with a long shirt or under a dress but to wear them with a regular shirt... people will see your butt crack. Super soft though!,0
3,First off this is sent vacuum packed. That's a good thing for sardines but a terrible thing for sweaters. There are deep horizontal creases and lots of them. Idk if they will come out with washing or not. The fit is skin tight. Like a body con dress. The model in the pic must be wearing 3 sizes bigger than her usual. This will be great if you want a form fitting sweater dress. It feels heavy. It just doesn't match the picture or description.,0
2,"Great idea, poor execution. Size and proportions are an issue.",0
1,"Amazon should pull this off there site , waste of money! Read the reviews !!!!!",0
5,This rating was chosen because this item met and exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it for any one needend a low cost and effective jewerly cleaner.,1
5,I’m 5’6 and weigh 135. I ordered a medium and it fits just right. Very comfortable.,1
3,"Love Nike, but these tops are VERY thin!  If you want a thin top, this would work fine.  It is see through if you get red or white.",0
4,Nice for the price !!!,1
5,Packaged to cause some minor flattening of the flower petals but it recovered fairly well.,1
2,Horrible looks like it was cut on the bottom,0
3,"Really like it, but it runs small",0
4,I ordered the larger of the two options s and its not really that roomy. The color is nice.,1
5,Beautiful great quality. All my friends want a pair of their own now.,1
5,"I thought it was an amazing jacket--well worth the money, beautifully constructed.  I bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift, however, and he thought it was &#34;too complicated&#34; and a bit too small, so I returned it.",1
5,Light weight dress and comfortable. I received a lot of compliments with this dress on,1
3,looks nice but it doesn't work,0
4,"I read reviews and looked at the sizing chart to determine which size to get for our daughter. I went with Small. I ordered 3 different colors and got 3 different lengths!  I even checked my order again to make sure I didn’t accidentally order a different size. These are all small. The purple fit the best and I’d love to have more because they are great, but now I have no clue what size to actually order!",1
2,"Very cute and great size but, after I showered, it changed color.",0
1,Love the style but....was super lightweight and just cheap. They feel stretched out. Hard to just slide to your head cuz they are so wide they fall off. Is one of those “get what you pay for” things. Will wear til they break which will probably be soon.,0
5,It’s really good But smaller for me,1
1,I want to love this and enjoy wearing it! However I have washed this set 8x or more. Soaked them used all different kinds of detergents on them. Shoot the first time washing them I put them in with my darks and now my other clothes smell. It’s like a horrible chemical smell like I have never smelled before!!! I didn’t realize how bad the smell of these actually were until I left my home and came back! The whole place smelled of this horrible chemical Oder I thought I was going to have to contact the fire department! It was just this set of lounge wear. Wow I hope no one else has this experience. They are a lovely set that I would love to wear but I’m going to have to throw them away! It’s so disappointing! I feel like they are true to size tho.,0
3,Cheap. Fabric is not fleece and is very thin.,0
1,Rips along seam,0
3,"i like it looks good but it keeps falling off my ear, still very cute though. i have to keep adjusting them, there are better ear cuffs out there.",0
5,"I just bought these last week and wore them to my first hot vinyasa class last night.  I am very happy with them.  I'm about 5'7"", waist 35 or so, and the large fits pefectly.  Yeah I know I'm a little overweight, but I wear it pretty well.<br /><br />Anyway the shorts were delivered when promised, in good condition.  Fit is close but not too snug.  I'm not one of these weirdos that likes to wear boxer briefs in class, but my regular gym shorts were too floppy, loose, and long.  These are just the right fit.  I also liked the inner liner, I felt cooler and freer than in my regular gym shorts and quick dry underwear underneath.  The fabric is also nice, quick-drying and it gave me great ""grip"" for my tree pose, but I didn't notice any unwanted friction during class.<br /><br />Only downside so far is no pockets, as other reviewers have stated.  I found myself reaching for pockets that weren't there.  But if you are a serious yogi, it's probably a fair trade, because there were no pockets to get in the way of my movements.<br /><br />Bottom line, really happy with these shorts.  I'll wear them to a few more classes and if I'm still happy i'll probably buy another pair.  My only caveat is that I can't speak to long term durability, since I've only worn them once.  Otherwise very happy.",1
3,As a female the plastic nosepad area was big and distracting in my vision.,0
1,"It is cute, but the quality of the recording is very, very grainy and low-quality. I guess you get what you pay for, but was expecting something a little better - my bad. My 19-year-old with Down syndrome loves Frozen, so I took a chance. It quit charging and coming on in late February, so it is now a piece of plastic, Chinese-made landfill. Won't buy again. Don't waste your money.",0
2,too small,0
2,"Very deep V and stiff neck, too large",0
1,Bought these and on the first day they stretched out so much.,0
5,"I absolutely adore this scarf! It was much bigger than I anticipated, but it's super comfy and looks great on. Definitely would recommend to anyone who likes this style.",1
5,Fits well over my face.,1
4,My son loves these shoes,1
5,fits over elastic leg wrap and is easy to pur on...non slip,1
3,There was white paint flecked onto the front of most of these that I had to scratch off with my finger nail.,0
5,"I love the quality and design of the socks, but they run a little smaller than I expected.  I loved them so much, I gave them to a friend and I'm ordering more in a larger size for me!  I ordered a medium and I wear a shoe size of 8 and a half to a 9.  I'm now going to order a large.  All of my other socks I've ordered from other brands have all been medium and they fit great.  I hate taking the time to return items so since they were a reasonable price, I gave them as a gift to a good friend with smaller feet; she absolutely loves them!!!",1
5,Love all Calida products,1
5,Love the way the Watch band looks and how easy it is to put on.,1
5,"Not much to say aside from I love this medallion. It has a habit of rotating to its backside, but I still love it",1
1,"Runs super small, the fabric is thin, and I would never recommend these socks!",0
3,Esta bonito lo único que son demasiado pequeños y no se ve nada de lo que tiene escrito,0
2,TARDIS broke off right away. I glued it back on so I could still wear them for my wedding. But that’s what I get for buying a cheap product,0
3,"This is an okay top for the price, unfortunately I had to return it because it was too small. The product photos make it seem as though there is some kind of stretch to the material but there is not at all. I couldn’t even get it on, so make sure you are taking that into consideration when buying. Otherwise it is a cute simple top, good length and material.",0
4,"I get so many compliments on this dress!!! Love it!!! However, it’s not very cool and doesn’t breathe well",1
5,Love it. Ordering me another color now,1
3,Definitely wind proof! Worked well until the zipper broke after the first wear,0
3,"I really want to like these, I really do. However, I am size 12 but a pretty big booty and these do not work well at all! The waist does not come high enough and slides down like crazy. Also if you have a booty like me then it does not make it look flattering at all.",0
5,These are the cutest little shoes. My daughter loves them! They’re comfortable and soft.,1
1,"Pants were to small, very stiff and were not what was advertised.",0
5,Darker red than the photos show but very flattering,1
1,Cute shirt but terrible quality. Super thin material and snags very very easily.,0
5,These are to enjoy during Christmas while playing many a Board Game with the family! The glasses make us &#34;look smarter&#34; :)  and we take lots of pics with these fun glasses!,1
5,"This dress fits so beautifully. Buy your size if you're a curvy girl. The material is thick but not too heavy. Honestly, just buy it.",1
2,"It's pretty, but doesn't lay nicely.  Wanted to flip over, definitely get what you pay for.",0
2,Size chart is way off. Ordered small (5'2/115 larger bust) and it is huge. No option for XS. Nice fabric but returning.,0
4,"This Racol Cosplay Wig seems to be good quality for what it is.  The hair is long and thick enough to hang down your back. At first glance, it appears thicker than it is.  When wearing this wig as a fashion piece, you might want to  wear a hat since the scalp shows through on the top. Enjoy!",1
5,Great glove liners. Works great with my gloves!,1
1,The skirt I had purchased. It was cheap quality material. And also It's too bad because I was wanting to use that too. For the springtime If you did Rousseau my order and not give me my refund. I would like a small one.,0
2,"One of the shirts (the black one) was very loose on the sides right underneath the arms. It seem stretched out, you can not wear it like that.",0
3,Its too large for my face,0
1,Too big and didn’t look so great,0
4,"My Ophthalmologist has told me on several occasions that I should 'try the amber filter' glasses for migraines and computer screens and things. I couldn't see paying a few hundred 'to try it' and find that it didn't help that much, so I got these.  I've been surprised that they were decent on a partially cloudy morning to use outside (like sun glasses when i left mine behind one day).  I usually need black/blue lenses for sunlight since I have light sensitivity.<br /><br />The primary concern when trying to read is these rest lower on the cheek so I'm always having to pull them up or adjust the bifocal position to use them for reading.  I put some moleskin on the edge to help lift them and it has made some difference but I think i'll put more maybe on the bridge of the nose this time because it's still hard to see that far down and you can't use bifocals for computer reading at all since that requires looking FORWARD.  (I can't use them that way unless i tilt my head back or just hold the glasses which defeats the purpose for being able to read the screen AND type.  I'm not using them to look at the keyboard I don't need them for that.)<br /><br />The filter does seem good with those bright lights which are sort of irritating like the SPOTS you see on book shelves etc. Even my darker glasses didn't help as much with those.<br /><br />One of my Dr's was like 'well I can see your eyes now and that's nice'!  So all in all for the price and the chance to 'try' the amber filter, a pretty good deal. I'd suggest they find a way to  keep the position of them higher on the face tho so anyone can use them for reading that's not JUST in your lap.  I tend to hold my phone, books and crochet etc higher up than that and extending your neck to adjust isn't a good idea either.",1
1,"The paracord weave or whatever you call it is very loose, the flint isn't even secured to the clip and comes out when you try to use it has a thermometer, which is great but, the Fahrenheit numbers are underneath the middle black circle and is hard to read. You have to tilt it and look at it at an angle to read the Fahrenheit numbers. Very disappointed.",0
3,"Tight on arms, had to alter but perfect length and fitting everywhere else",0
5,Love it 😍,1
5,BracletS are adorable.  I love them,1
1,Odered the shirt with tikis on it and thats not what i received. Messed up my gift to a friend on his 75th Birthday.,0
5,Soooo cute and very sparkly!!!  Love them,1
5,Love this bag! So roomy and well made,1
3,Great for the price. The tint is darker than the picture which was disappointing.,0
1,"Purchased for an interview.  Wore it once and 1 of the links broke where the ""V"" forms",0
3,"While these are dainty and beautiful, they came with white pearls. Not black. Had they been as advertised, they would be 5 stars.",0
3,Nice looking bracelet but the description says it's 8&#34; and it's not.,0
4,"Fit as expected, maybe slightly larger (they're cut for American bodies: so the fit was generous/acurate.) I bought the white pants in large, the fabric is lightweight cotton knit (lightweight sweatpants) -not dressy in any way (maybe the black can be dressed up- but not the white- too lightweight). I bought them for yoga/lounging around/sleeping in & I love them! 100% cotton is perfect for hot nights with the a/c on, the wide elastic waist band is very comfortable, has a self-tie if you need them tighter. Lg has a length that was perfect for me: 30&#34; inseam, @ 145 lbs they were not tight, & the crotch fit as it should & the waistband sat at my waist (not hip huggers).",1
5,"Very nice fabric,soft and nice going to order more colors.",1
3,Came very wrinkled. Not sure if it can be thrown into the dryer. I normally wear size 0 or xs in clothes and this was a bit large on me. Length was okay (I'm 5'4).,0
4,"This fits way to small, size up! Otherwise quality is fine for the price!",1
3,Was made in Taiwan and I don't think it was made with cared.,0
2,"Love these but their sizing is way off, had to return",0
5,For work,1
2,Misleqding. No boy outfit only girls,0
5,"perfect in every way, fast delivery, great packaging.. my highest recommendations,.. Thank you.",1
1,"really horrible of bad quality, I’m really mad",0
5,I purchased these as a gift for someone and was told they work well. They have been happy with them. The beanie fits well and the sound is good. Need to get one for myself!,1
5,Nice details and finish.,1
1,"The band worked at first but the clasp is not as good as the band I got before it.  The band clasps snagged my shirt cuffs.  The band itself was defective and the ""stainless steel""  links became undone with sharp bits of metal sticking out from it.  They cut my fingers and wrist and snagged a good  pinpoint cotton shirt.  The band also is not as shiny as the last stainless band I bought.  Maybe there is a lot of lead in the band because it tarnishes and looks like lead.  Even though the picture appears to be shiny, this band is darker or more dull than the picture.  It keeps the fitbit on my wrist and it doesnt slide around.  Dont buy this one",0
2,We were playing with options for bridesmaid dresses and this particular one was uncomfortable and fit very awkward. Sent back and went with something more versatile.,0
5,My husband picked this out for our 9-year-old niece. She loved it; her mom sent us a video of her using it with some friends. The glow-in-the-dark pen seems to work on the shirt as if it's a lightboard--the pen marks were definitely illuminated. She drew a little happy face and it glowed on her shirt. Made a great gift.,1
4,"I got this bathing suit for my wife. She’s never owned a “cheeky” style before, but she said this one was a good in between and helped her feel covered enough to not be too self-conscious. She got the small since she has a short torso. The medium likely would have been too big, but the issue she had was fitting the tight waist band above her hips. The black waist band doesn’t stretch very much, so keep that in mind when ordering. Overall, the quality is pretty good and it is a flattering one piece. Although she does not recommend it for too much swimming or activity since the top is very open and you can easily slip out.",1
5,"small and cute! its so adorable! it looks exactly like in the picture, def worth the price",1
5,Super nice for the price. Pop up allows the necklace to be showcased. Will buy again.,1
3,I love this purse. I love how it looks and I love the color but after having it for a little over a week the inside zipper popped right off. I was able to get it back on after a little bit of finagling using some tweezers but now the ends of the zipper are exposed and I have to be careful not to open it or close it all the way.,0
1,The product did not fit properly. There is too much material between the rods. The fabric keeper pockets are not deep enough. The slightest breeze blows the umbrella panels off the rods. I should have gone to Home Depot.,0
5,"I needed a 40B strapless and was hesitant to order this since I didn’t like the ones I tried on in store or had ordered. I was pleasantly surprised that this was comfortable and I used a clasp extender to make it more so. I just don’t like a tight back, especially with any back bulge showing in certain dresses.  I’ve tried it on several times and the bra stays up, has some silicone to help with that, cups are a nice shape, and I feel confident in the bra. And I can use it again with the transparent or black straps. Happy with my purchase!",1
5,Fits great! Love it,1
2,I used them one time andvthe hinge broke on one of the Lens. It’s also hard to put makeup on because the lens folds down and it’s in the way.,0
5,This is one of my fav tops,1
5,I absolutely love this dress!! It fit perfectly and the fact it has pockets is fabulous!!! Will buy more!,1
3,"My dad passed away and he was creamated , so I ordered these for all of my nieces, so a total of 8. 1 arrived broken, and two of them already broke. So they are cute but not made to last.",0
2,"Not satisfied,  not true to size.. might wanna go a size up or two",0
5,The piercings came as pictured. Feels sturdy and good quality and doesn't randomly come undone.,1
1,To small,0
2,Love product.. but broke the first week.,0
2,The quality is very poor ... in my case le lower part of the glasses doesn't really work .,0
5,"I loved how it fits, it’s confortable and soft fabric. I bought the nude and can go with anything!",1
3,It's very thin you can almost see thru it,0
1,"Ordered the clear lense, received an ugly mirrored dark tinted lense. Will not work, now have to deal with the hassle of returns and replacement.",0
3,Fragile.,0
4,"is a little thin, but great for the gym.",1
3,"Edited Review:  I changed my star level on these because after having them just less than a year they are already beginning to get a hole near the seam.  Before this I loved these but I am a little disappointed that they are already starting to get holes in them.  I am not sure if I just got a poorly sewn pair or if they would all do this.<br /><br />Original Review: They fit true to size.  I usually am a women's 8 or 9 and fit perfectly into the medium.  Also, for me they are a really nice length.  I am about 5'5&#34; and might have short legs because often capri pants look more like high waters on me, they often come too far down my legs.  This pair stops just a few inches below my knees. They are made of very comfortable material.  They are a comfortable fit, tight as yoga pants should be but not too tight to make them uncomfortable.  I have worn them both to do yoga and to just relax around the house and they are perfect for both!  They didn't slip down while doing yoga which is important for me as this has been a problem with other pants worn for yoga.  The only thing I don't love about them is that sometimes the line from my underwear shows a little bit (however I think this is usually the case with cozy tighter fitting clothes) and it wasn't a huge deal for me.  After washing them a few times I have noticed that the area where my thighs rub together the material is starting to pill (when it forms small balls on the material) a little bit.  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a writing review, however, this is my honest review.",0
5,I love love love the necklace!!’ I wish it had matching earrings. It is very nicely made and it is beautiful.,1
1,Drit cheap,0
3,Letters on front were white rather than gold and needed to be a size larger.,0
1,"Not true to size, made in China.  I find that most garments made in China is not true to size for the average Plus Size American woman.😬",0
5,"It's perfect, I'm so in love with it. I am 5'3 137 and have a booty. I ordered a L",1
5,This is a nice little set of piercing jewelry for the price. Everything came accounted for and the jewelry is very colorful and nice looking. Its good quality for puercings and to prevent infection. I overall highly recommend,1
4,"Smart woollies are the best!  So warm, comfortable.  Used it in Vermont in subzero weather under my sweater & I was toasty.  Plus not bulky!  Gave one to my old Vermonter Mom & she has been wearing it.  A bit pricey, but worth it.",1
5,"Soft, has pockets and is just the right length. I’m an elementary teacher and found this dress perfect! It is comfortable, easy to wash-hang to dry.  I ordered a print and I love it. I ordered XL and found it to be exactly as I had hoped.",1
3,I’ve ordered two sets. The first set was perfect. The second set was not the same black as the first. Instead the are more of a shiny stainless black. These are being used to Realestate signs so I’d really like them to match. I will have to make sure I don’t use the two different ones in the same yard sign. Functionally speaking they’re great so far.,0
1,"Buyer beware.  I'm pretty sure the one I received was a cheap China knock off.  At first I didn't realize it was a fake.  It didn't fit right - short and wide.  Cheap material and printing of the logo.  I thought it just must be a cheap item.  Then I saw someone else wearing one a few months later.  Theirs was excellent quality, and looked like what is shown here in the picture.  I wish I would have realized it sooner.  I would have definitely gotten a refund.  Now it's too late.  Check your seller before purchasing.",0
5,Very pleased with this purchase. I would definitely do business with this vendor again.,1
2,The sizing is all over the place with these. I ordered a 6 since my son currently measures at a 5.5. They arrived and were so large that they flopped around and just looked huge on him. Returned them for a smaller size and that size wouldn’t even go on his foot. Returned those and chose to buy locally and pay more for a different brand that are size 6 and fit perfectly.,0
5,"Such an adorable outfit!! My son just turned 5 years old & the 6 fit him perfectly. For the price, the quality is great.",1
2,"The dress is absolutely adorable but the sizing is not good.  If you are at all petite, it will be way too long.  Even with pretty high wedges there was still about 2 inches hanging on the ground.  Also several others have commented on the sleeves.  They are very tight.  Super disappointed.  I don't generally return things but this one I did.",0
1,"Broke almost immediately. I love everything about this watch aesthetically, but it has never worked right. Moves too slow.",0
5,Love the belts what a great value.,1
1,El anillo se empezó a descolorar una parte era platiada y la otra amarilla muy poca calidad del material,0
2,"This item arrived quickly but it just didn't work the way I'd hoped it would. My husband said it actually seemed to make my snoring worse. So, the search continues.",0
2,Design is good but fabric is horrible. I’ve been wearing it about 3-4months now it already worn out :(,0
3,"If you're a C36, this will not fit you. If you're probably B34-B36 , the fit for it might be just right. It didn't work out for me but it worked out for someone else that I know so it's okay.",0
3,The is nice but it has already begun to loose the shine on the ring bottom. I guess you can't wear it everyday.,0
5,My daughters favorite saying shared between her and her Nana who has since passed. A cute piece of jewelry but for her one with a lot of sentimental value.,1
5,as described,1
5,"Very comfortable costume, very roomy large.",1
3,"I’ve recently lost weight so I’m between sizes. After looking at measurements and reading reviews I decided to go with a large, however I should have stuck with a medium. It fits, but it offers no support for those that have a larger bust that intend on doing running or high intense cardio. It’s fine for weight lifting or walking, just don’t plan on going for a good run unless you want the girls flopping in the wind.",0
1,"These great shoelaces did not arrive, even though the site says that they did. What now?",0
2,"I bought these for my niece and nephew and a little over a month, bot of the zippers broke. :/ This is highly disappointing, because they both loved the jackets. Other than that, they were great, but I am highly disappointed that they didn't even last the season.<br />I can't even find a way to contact the manufacturer to get them repaired.",0
5,Love anything grinch. Very cute!,1
2,Color is gorgeous but can’t find a bra to wear that does not show. Gaps at the bust and too low in the back for a regular bra.,0
2,"The patch is so large, it makes the hat comically tall. The clasp is the cheap press in a hole plastic kind. The hat and patch are well made. Just poorly matched with the size of the patch. Would look fine if you were 7 foot tall. Holding the emblem in such high regard, I may be overly criticle. But was greatly disappointed.",0
5,"Just as described, going to use for photos !!",1
5,Good quality great price!,1
2,Good for a cheap costume.  Runs very very small.  I normally wear an extra large.  Their extra large I cannot get the vest even close to buttoning.  Will just wear a shirt under it.  The belt won’t fit either.,0
5, ,1
3,Green is very dark. Not as fitted as I would have liked. Shoulders were pretty wide. I'm 5' 7&#34; 135lb and I tried a medium.  Material was wrinkled but I didn't try steaming it.,0
3,Head bands are too tight.,0
3,Its cute but it run small and I am a medium. But there isn't a lined so everyone will be able to see your pubic hairs and nipples,0
1,This sweater does not look anything like the picture.  The color is wonky and doesn’t lay anything like the picture.  Really disappointed.,0
2,"Way too small, not for the curvy!",0
5,A gift for a friend,1
5,Thank you! Good job!,1
5,it is an amazing product i ordered two because i liked it so much. It came super quick,1
4,It will see lots of usage skiing.  Waterproofness was not heavily tested yet.  One criticism is that it looks like a Pillsbury glove except in black.,1
5,Lovely necklace.  Given as a gift and the recipient loved it.,1
4,Fits as expected. Cool and comfortable. Washes easily and dries quickly.,1
1,The bracelet fell apart as soon as I put it on. Tiny beads went everywhere. Not well made.,0
5,"I love this dress a lot! I'm 5'3 and weight about 140lbs. I bought a size S. I have somewhat chubby arms and wide hips, but this size was great... Except I wish the waist was at least 1 cm narrower, and it is very long, nothing high heeled shoes can't solve though.. but everything else is perfect. The most surprising thing was the fabric, it looks and feels good quality. 10/10 would recommend.",1
3,Would have liked it a little bit larger.,0
3,It was not as great as I expected because the ends were not flat. It was a gift for a man in hospice so I kept it. Feel it is overpriced but hopefully he will enjoy it. I pressed it but should have been flawless for that price. The Seams didn’t lay flat,0
1,"So bad. Don't do. I think the other reviews agree I just had looked at so many PJs for my picky daughter I purchased these without reading or rememberinv what everyone said. The Santa was weird looking and the colors were off, crappy fabric, and the pants are cmical, again colors off looks like 80s McDonald's and they're that garbage silky material that somehow feels like sandpaper more than silk.",0
3,"Looks very cheap- bumps in the metal. Quite heavy, but chain is very secure.",0
2,Did not look anything like the pants in the photo when i received them😔 very dissappointed,0
5,"I bought this for my wife who loves the healing properties of stones. So, when I gave her the bracelet in the bag it came in along with the card, she was incredibly excited! I selected the bracelet with the cat's eye and the overall bracelet was done beautifully. The bracelet was also a perfect fit, not too tight and not too loose. My only wish is that the card could actually fit in the bag so that the card does not precede the bracelet.",1
3,"quedo corto de tiro, solo para mujeres pequeñas",0
2,"When the slippers first arrived, I loved them! So cute! So comfy!<br />But then I wore them. They developed holes within a month, and they stretched out. So now I have holey slippers that don't stay on my feet.",0
2,"Really like it, but the tree charm fell off after a few days.",0
1,Followed theor chart to size. Definitely not the same size scale. I ordered a size bigger than what it recommended for my regular size and what showed up looked like it was 5 sizes to small. Definitely not sized for regular size marketing,0
2,Although I'm not the first to mention this they sent me the wrong one.i ordered a grey cat purse.they sent me a brown cat purse.i dont care for the brown one.plus the zipper pull was broke off so disappointed other than the zipper they seem made well at least.,0
2,"I was surprised when I got the wrist keychain.  The rings were in a separate bag, therefore…I went and got the teenager Nextdoor to put the wrings on.",0
4,Beautiful looks like it is a painting delicate and very pretty,1
4,"These leggings are super comfortable, but fortunately I read some of the reviews and was informed about my purchase.  I read that they run slightly small and I would agree.  They MIGHT be considered a 1X, but I ordered a 1X/2X and they fit more like a small 1X.  Just be aware of your actual size and that you might want to order larger if possible, but they are definitely worth it!",1
3,This runs a little small in the bust. Wish it had some stretch to it.,0
5,I love the material and the design. The fit is perfect and can’t wait to wear it at the beach,1
2,"HUGE! I have other Adar scrubs and these don’t compare. These are the lowest quality. I suppose for the price, that’s what you get; cheap material. No stretch. Scratchy. My other Adar scrubs are IDENTICAL to Dickies scrubs so I was expecting these to be similar to the Dickies Unisex scrubs; they are not. These are plain with no shape. I do like the color I purchased.",0
3,"This dress was too long for me. I'm 5'4"" and I would have to wear heels or wedges in order to walk. I also thought the blue looked more like a navy but when I got it, the blue was more of a bright royal blue.",0
1,Bad,0
1,I ordered my usual size and it was hilariously small. Couldn’t get it past my chest. I would say size up 2-3 sizes but they don’t go past an XL.,0
5,As described.,1
5,"Love these use them to protect my sneakers from dust, dirt,  smoke stains etc. I want more I already bought 3 packs. They are just what I needed",1
3,This is toooo small and the lace isn't attractive.,0
5,fit good. Good quality,1
3,Awkward fit,0
2,Grace karin clothes are expensive and very poor quality according to the price. Does not look what its in the picture.,0
3,"I think they are super cute to wear out, lots of compliments but they are a bit uncomfortable to wear after a while of use. Kinda not worth it but definitely a nice look.",0
5,"I’m about 5’10” more or less and these shirts definitely are so much better than expected. They arrived quick, look and feel amazing! Can’t wait to fully grow into these shirts!",1
3,Did not look like the picture - returned.,0
5,Looks like a genuine Baraccuta.  I still can't believe they can get it to me including overseas postage for $35.00!,1
1,"Disappointed. The size small to fit and infant baby. But furthermore, the feathers all started falling apart as soon as we event attempted to try on.",0
2,"Would be cute but it is way too small. I am 5'6&#34; 145 lbs. I normally wear a med/large so I ordered a large at first, ended up ordering a XXL later and it still didn't fit! The torso is way too short. The metal embellishment at the top of the breast cup where the red is didn't even come up to my breasts, both suits were like this. It's a shame because it would have been cute had it been long enough.",0
5,Works as advertised.  Good quality.  Better price than walmart.,1
3,Kinda hard to put in but super cute,0
2,This product runs at least two sizes larger than advertised!,0
3,"belt seemed cheap, as though it won't last long.",0
4,My daughter love it,1
3,Loved them but they are cheap and fragile. Broke within 2 months.,0
4,A tad too big. I ordered large and fit loosely.,1
3,"Arrived vacuum packed. NOT fluffy, very thin and cheap. Colors are no where near vibrate, as listing photo depicts, and it definitely runs small. I imagine stitching falling apart simply putting your arms in it, let alone running it through washer. This is something you'd buy at five below. Disappointed ☹️",0
5,"Oh my goodness !! I love this little cutie pie dress! The fabric is a good weight , it’s soft , it fits well. I adore it and ordered another while wearing this one. This. Is. A. Must. Have !!!!",1
3,I Did not read the description correctly and didn't realize it was a buckled bracelet. Its good if you want something like that but I wish I had seen that.,0
4,"This metal band is good looking and is easy to put on/take-off (once I got used to the double butterfly clasp. I had to use my watch tools to remove several links to get the fit just right, so keep that in mind. My only complaint is the black powder coating seems to rub off easily on areas that are exposed to rubbing. This is most noticeable on the clasp since the underside of my wrist rests on my desk most of the day and just moving my arm around has caused it to stuff a bit.",1
2,Bad quallity,0
5,I recieved my item!!  thank you,1
5,Classy and elegant,1
2,Fits good the glasses will not stay up when riding I would order one without glasses,0
5,Love it.  I already have the ballcap for the warmer months but needed something now that winter is approaching in Chicago.  So far it has done a good job of keeping my head and ears warm,1
3,"The color is very nice, size smaller than average medium, leather is pretty stiff.",0
4,"These are great!  I wish they were available in other colors, I'd have a whole set.",1
5,It has great tucking.  love it.  They are so cute.,1
5,I used a label template to create the insert for these keychains.  They made great gifts.  Each one is individually packaged so it is REALLY fun to open every.single.one.  But it makes the receiver feel like they got a professionally made item so all in all - great product!,1
3,"Ordered my usual size, but ring was too tight.<br />Returned ring.",0
1,It's thicker than the backing.,0
1,"First time worn, the seam completely unraveled on the right side leaving a gaping hole. I would not recommend them.",0
2,I just received my order today and this are tiny I mean tiny.  Like for kids bracelet not happy.  Nothing like the pictures at all.,0
5,liked the charm very much,1
4,"Very flattering cut, nice light weight cotton jersey but the shoulder opening is extremely wide. Luckily I have very broad shoulders for a woman but it still slips a little, so be aware.",1
5,Ordered for my daughters 80 work out costume and it’s so cute! Very happy,1
1,"Faker!! Warning complete junk, the red peeling off just got it. Brought to pandora & it’s a fake! I’m very angry, will file an A-Z.. Buyer beware!! Horrible replica.",0
3,I wanted to use this with a sweater for really cold weather and the jacket sleeves aren't full enough.  I can only use it when the weather is warmer.,0
5,It fits under my chin and stay in place. The nose clip is adjustable and my glasses don’t become foggy. I handwash and let air dry. There was no shrinkage.,1
5,"My 9yo loves these, wears them constantly.",1
5,Very pretty. I am now looking for matching earrings.,1
3,A litle big,0
3,"christmas present, not yet given",0
3,The fingers are too long and the glove part is too narrow.,0
1,As soon as I grabbed the package I didn’t even have to open I could tell it was way to big. I opened it anyway in hopes I was wrong but I was right they where no where near the size the should have been. They are getting returned,0
1,"Was so excited for this suit, i thought the royal blue with red flowers would be vibrant and have a retro look to it. What arrived was navy blue with yellowish tint on all of the flowers. It looks like an old grandmother's couch compared to the cute pattern online. I also purchased a red one that looks much more like a coral orange. It also had no gap as pictured in the chest area. Be ready for inconsistencies in color, pattern and style if you purchase.",0
2,"This was an absolutely horrific bathing suit experience. At first glance, the stitching already looked like it was ready to go at any moment. The top runs EXTREMELY small, however the bottoms weren't bad. My 36DD's practically laughed at the flimsy top. If you have any curves, there is no way to stop this suit from looking overly provocative... if you can even get into the thing. I still love the shape of the bikini and I was able to find one by Esther Williams that I absolutely adore and received endless compliments on. Great idea, but poor execution. I'll pass.",0
5,"Love these adorable leg warmers! They are actually off white, not pure white and have a different off white shade lace at the top. The are plenty long to go up over the knee (I'm 5'10&#34;) or can scrunch down. The buttons are wood and all the stitching/ginishing is high quality. They just fit over my 16 inch calves without overly stretching (fabric around buttons would pullopen if stretched more). They stayed up well over my leggings and held their shape through the day. Nice weight knit and good quality materials. I will order in other colors!",1
5,Loved this dress.  I get lots of compliments,1
5,This shirt is amazing. The print. The color. The size. It’s EVERYTHING!  I have big boobs so I normally get large. And this one was a large and fits great,1
5,Bought for my 11yo son. So it did fit a bit bigger on him. Nice material and lightweight but warm (for him anyways) and he loved it so cant complain,1
3,I was pretty shocked when I saw the grosgain ribbon ties.  I'm just hoping they will hold up.  The pictures in the ad showed what  looked like really strong rope like ties.  My package was wrapped twice and the product had some grease stains on it so I'm thinking it was a return and wrapped the second time for re-sale.,0
1,What the hell?! It’s just a sheet of cloth. I want My $$ back and I’ll mail it back to you.,0
3,"GOOD PRODUCT, BAD FIT, MADE FOR TINY ARMS...",0
3,Pretty well-fitting dress except that I didn’t particularly like the gold toned hardware.,0
5,"Love my dress! This is the 3rd one I have purchased. Great comfort, material is comfy too...I would definitely recommend. I plan to purchase another one. Style and comfort!",1
3,Easy to wash; some came ripped; and one of mine broke while putting behind my hair. I would say they have a couple uses to them but you never know when they’re rip which is annoying. Prob won’t buy again with so many other masks out.,0
5,This jacket sleeves are very long on me. This jacket is very thin and does not feel or look like fleece material. This jacket is cute and good for fall weather. Reference 5’2 160lbs,1
5,"I had taken an old pair of kit gloves and they worked great, until they started unraveling. I couldn't stitch the finger holes correctly and they weren't right. Found exactly what I needed on Amazon.",1
1,Fragile. Cheap build cheap appearance.,0
1,You get what you pay for.  Returned.  Looks like cheap plastic.,0
5,Very Nice For Price,1
5,This wrap is comfortable and great looking for a super price. Really like the color taupe - goes with a lot!,1
2,Not the quality I was hoping for. The material looks different in the photo as do the sleeves.<br />It’s ok. It’s a blouse you can throw on to run an errand I suppose. It isn’t anything you’d wear somewhere of importance. I was going to wear it to take my daughters class on their field trip however my daughters said if I wore it they wouldn’t talk to me again. I wore something else and my twins fought over me rather than ignoring me. I wear a small medium and ordered a large. It fit how I would want it to. It is short wasted however.,0
3,"Sleeves are snug, but overall not bad. I don't hand wash and haven't had any issues with beads falling off yet!",0
5,My new favorite bandage dress brand. They actually created shape to the breasts so they fit and are ridiculously flattened like most bandage dresses! Felt so sexy in this dress.,1
5,I love the colors they all look really vibrant after several washes and the fabric on here is very comfortable.,1
1,The pants are super warm and comfortable. But straight out of the bag the were torn already. Which is a shame because I really wanted to keep them.<br /><br />But for $75.00 this shouldn't happen. It feels glued and not stitched. Dog water product for extravagant prices.,0
3,They suck ripped when I put them on<br />I trashed three pair in two hours,0
5,Loved the fit of this. It hugs your waist and then flares out. The material is as expected for the price. The pattern is super cute. I always get compliments when I wear it.,1
2,I like the feel of the fabric but the color was off.  More gray than green floral print.  Also it is very short.,0
2,Cheap quality,0
4,"Nice gaiter.  My only disappointment was the ear holes didn’t match where my ears are on the side of my head and I would say I have a normal size / shape head.  Made my ears pull forward which is uncomfortable.  However, if you don’t utilize the ear holes for their intentions you have a handy dandy vent on the sides which does let a little cool air in during this hot humid weather we have in the South.",1
3,nice,0
3,Esta lindo pero con una vez que se lo puso mi hija se descosió,0
5,"nice watch , nice size",1
5,Excellent,1
2,not as long a photo shows.,0
1,"I had to return the watchband. It was a tiny fraction wider than the lugs of my Moto 360 G 2nd generation 46mm smart watch. Even though the listing says it fits the 2nd gen Moto 360 watch, it just wouldnt go in. The 22mm watch band was the tiniest fraction wider than the watch.",0
4,"The fabric is a little on the thin side but it is not sheer. It’s soft, comfy and a little oversized. It’s also nice and long which is great but it can get a little bit wrinkly. I washed it on delicate and hung it to dry to help alleviate this. You also have to take the time to re-fold the sleeves. Overall it’s a nice shirt and looks good on.",1
2,"It’s a cute pattern, but it’s smaller than I expected and therefore not as modest as I would have liked. I thought the shorts would also be a little longer than they are. I am returning this item because it didn’t meet my expectations.",0
5,"Bought for my son, Keith..nice thick hat, will be great for WNY winters. Quality made worth the $$.",1
5,I tried it on brass and silver and it did the job.,1
4,The material is of good quality. Makes me feel closer to the lord when praying. would buy again if needed.,1
5,Cute and fun way to spruce up a pair of white crocs. I absolutely love these charms 😍!!! I will definitely order again.,1
5,Love these boots there just what I’ve been looking for they are true to size. These go great with any outfit very comfortable and stylish.,1
3,Seems okay.  I don't see the &#34;high quality cow leather&#34; mentioned in the description.  The buckle is plastic so it won't set off alarms st the airport.,0
4,I ordered it for yard work.,1
2,"I love these pants.  Nice material, comfortable, everything I want in a pair of pants for camping.  Except the belt.  Whoever designed this belt should be fired immediately and I'm not kidding about that.  It's total garbage, it's an S-hook that is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UNHOOK.  When I'm camping and I've had a couple of drinks, it's a multi-minute process trying to fumble around and get the belt unhooked.  So you think, okay no problem I'll pull out the belt and use a normal, non-garbage one.  IT'S SEWN IN.  They took the absolute worst feature of the pants, something commonly replaceable, and decided to make it permanent for some insane reason.<br /><br />It's such a bad belt that I basically can't wear these pants any longer.  They sit at home in the closet.",0
2,"Nice but made me look big, to flowie",0
5,stylish but allowed at football games and concerts. great size - fits lots of stuff!,1
5,Very excellent,1
5,"Awesome headband! I've had a lot of headbands that claim they are no slip, but this one actually is! I can wear it running and it doesn't go anywhere!",1
4,"My husband loves this robe!  Soft, cozy, and attractive.  the robe had a slight chemical odor, probably from the dye used, and had to be laundered after the first wearing.  Other than that, it is a lovely robe.",1
3,Fun and entertaining. The pics are very pixelated and it’s very difficult to see through the masks but LOTS of FUN!,0
5,Love this ring great fit . I have  a  metal  allergy  and i can wear this jjust fine. So happy. Great color,1
5,You definitely need to be ok with a plunging neckline to wear this as is. It is very cute and the straps in the back are adjustable.,1
1,This shoe came broken. One of the brown straps was broken and hanging on one side. Very cheaply made!!!,0
4,supercute for my daugfhters upcoming dance class,1
5,"big to big, small to small. Yet the three in the middle are awesome sizes for me. I like how they are made, and they look very nice",1
5,"Great earrings, perfect size!",1
2,cheap... materials.,0
5,I really like these. My septum has only been pierced three months and these are the first new rings I've put in but I took the advice of another reviewer on here and I lightly sanded the end and it snaps together and apart easily now. Using needle nose pliers to get a good grip doesn't hurt either if you don't want to bother sanding the end so it snaps better. I also tried barely stretching  one a tiny bit apart (with small pliers)  and afterwards it snapped  easily with that adjustment as well. These are SOOOO worth the money. My local hipster piercer wanted $80 for his cheapest clicker nose ring. pfffft.,1
5,Tons of compliments.,1
1,"These blade style earrings are so small and barely noticable. I was under the impression that they would at least stand out a bit more than they do. 1 star, would NOT reccomend",0
3,"Runs small, thin T-shirt material. Looks nice",0
2,"Makes you look like a box. No fit to waist as all, make u look 3 sizes bigger. Comfy and well made but no fit at all very strait sides.",0
2,"The appearance was a little cheap, the construction and workmanship were not that great, its worth it to spend a few more dollars and get a better quality product",0
5,I love this shirt so much.  I wear it all the time!,1
2,The silver is pretty but the Ruby is not real..it looks cloudy so it looks to obvious that it is fake. But I love the design.,0
4,Ties are a little short in length,1
5,Follow the size chart carefully and you should be good. Nice quality... Can't wait to wear it?,1
4,"Affordable, comfortable, soft, thin, yet feminine t-shirts. I recommend ordering a size up. Runs a little small and it does shrink a little after washing cold/drying-- I usually wear medium but ordered large, and it was a perfect loose fit. I did return one color (royal blue) because it was darker and not as vibrant as pictured but I'll be ordering more colors in the future.",1
5,Beatifull wacth ;),1
5,Bought these to wear to our annual fire department banquet. Great price.,1
5,"I've owned this shirt for a couple of years, it's held up great",1
4,"I enjoy the variety of styles, you can wear this as. You can wear as a dress, I'm approx. 5'3. Wear also with leggings, jeans, etc. The color combination's are nice. I would suggest, to improve this item, by, adding lycra, or material that allows the piece to stretch. Even though the fit, fits as expected, the stretch, allows for a longer lasting, and most quality purchase.",1
3,Way toon small my husband has an athletic build and thick legs and these wouldn't even go up his thighs,0
5,Great colors and material,1
1,Can see right through it,0
5,A mi Hijo le encanto.. la Tela es suavesita!!.. el tirando del lobo es genial. Muy conforme con la compra.,1
5,Nice gift,1
3,I read the reviews and ordered a size up just to be safe! Still a little too small on me. But it is very cute and seems very well made! Ill<br />Probably give away as a present!,0
5,Great pj's!!,1
3,"Not in love with this biker short. Fabric is soft but does not feel very good quality.<br /><br />For reference, I ordered size M and I am usually size 4.<br /><br />What I did not like:<br />- The elastic band is too thin and it is not too comfortable.<br />- Even though size seems correctly, the short just don't fit well. A little 'loose"" on the front, but I am sure if I size down, it will be too tight.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />- Color<br />- Length",0
5,This necklace was perfect in every way. I will treasure it for a long time.,1
3,Order a size down and note that the straps are not adjustable. Very little support but with the right size holds you in but doesnt support. The back strap has only two tightening holes but they are not far enough apart to really change the fit. Material is soft.,0
5,Nice color coded band make it easy to find the correct flash drive they are connected to.,1
3,Beautiful.  Way big for average wrist.,0
5,"Very cute, fit as expected...I actually ordered a size up for my 18 month twin girls. They're currently a 6, but ordered a 7 so they have a little room. Fits just fine and seem like they'll last...we shall see lol!",1
5,The feel,1
4,"This is a little short, but super cute with leggings!",1
3,These are good for leaving around the house. I often forget where I leave my reading glasses so these are cheap enough to leave everywhere I may need to see some smaller writing. Not really good for the car as they are not tough enough for that environment nor really great for the office as the lens are not sharp enough you would want to rely upon all day. Lens are a little soft so be careful or they will scratch and they seem to pick up every smudge possible. But for the price these things are acceptable.,0
1,"When I opened my package, the this item was for a small person, not a 2x tall large.  I'm disappointed cause now I have to pay and mail it back :(",0
5,Love this shirt. Great for sun protection and so flattering. Love the pattern and color.,1
2,[[VIDEOID:ef84107921246244565452f863e65539]] These would’ve been great if they didn’t come ripped. I was planning on using them to keep my dogs from scratching. I can’t do that now that they are already ripped,0
3,"Beware as it runs about four sizes too small. I'm likely going to return it this week and it's sad because the print is very pretty even for me--and I don't much like prints at all. I should and will try to take a pic before returning it so you can see that it's not that transparent. I wore it naked to try it on (TMI) and though I'm fair I think that even a medium skinned person wouldn't find it too obnoxious or see-through. It is, basically a freaking rectangle sewn once on each side. That part of the stitching is poor. But whoever sewed the seams on the neckline and the sleeves is a freaking seam master. Really fine stitching there. I just think it's overall too small.",0
4,it's worth no more than the asking price,1
3,"I have sensitive ears, so I needed to find simple studs that I can wear daily. These are great because they come with several pairs. However, one pair is pretty large, so definitely not for daily wear. I cannot see myself wearing that those large studs because they are quite heavy.",0
1,Was 1-2 sizes too small,0
5,"Before I ordered this item, I read reviews like I do before I buy anything.  There USED to be 4 reviews, one of which said they fit small and to order one size up.  Thanks to that review, the size I got fit fine, snug but not tight.  They are very comfortable and convenient.  UPDATE:  These are so comfortable I ordered three more pair. Without getting graphic, with me being a ""natural"" man, these separate things ending the uncomfortable and painful stray hair from getting caught under a fold of skin. Would recommend for any man, especially other ""natural"" men.",1
4,Wish they were warmer. But not bad. Like the Velcro so baby doesn't get them off!,1
1,"I ordered this necklace and turned out to be disappointed. It was too stiff, heavy, and wide...made it so uncomfortable to wear around my neck. I contacted for a return and was told that there would be a charge for a shipping fee and restocking fee.",0
1,I didn't like it..the bill was too long for my face and the inside lining peeked out when I would put it on. I tried to make it work but sadly I returned it. The color was more taupe than cream. That was another hit.,0
5,Looks cool feels good ..Going to get more from the seller,1
4,"When I got this band I was super excited, I'm obsessed with sunflowers, I wore it for a bout a week or maybe a little longer and the bracket holding the insert part for the watch fell off. I WAS able to repair it but now I only wear this band on ""special"" occasions.",1
4,Lighter weight then my Goldtoe socks I usually purchase at another store. The socks are $7-9 dollars cheaper so hopefully the socks will last long enough to be worth it. If so I'll get more... If not I'll pay the $ and go back to original.,1
4,It's comfortable and stylish. It feels like good leather.,1
5,Super comfy and cute!,1
2,"Beautiful fabric, beautiful skirt, but even with the sizing chart, incredibly small and uncomfortable. It will look beautiful hanging in my closet.",0
1,"I was sent t-shirts, and not tank tops. My daughter was very disappointed",0
5,My new favourite earrings!,1
2,"Hi all. I don't make very many negative reviews.  But this is beyond upsetting. I brought these last week. And this is one week of qeari g to school. This company does not color their foam.the sad thi g about these shoes is that they fit well, they look and feel well on my child. As well as reasonably price. I had to buy these in stead of our nomal higher end brand due to no one had size 13 anywhere. I would not recommending this brand . Sadly...",0
5,Beautiful and fit well,1
5,Grandson loved it.,1
4,Love them very comfortable,1
2,"I would rate this a perfect 5 stars. But I only received the top and not the bottoms, I contacted amazon and I was told I would have to return the top and get a credit the order I bought. But I only wanted the bottoms sent to me without doing all of that. Needless to say please be aware of this!!!!  The product is a nice",0
2,"Skirt patterns are done with glitter, which will get all over the house. I returned it as soon as I saw the glitter. There are many versions out there that don't have this issue.",0
4,Super cute.. looks just like the picture,1
1,"I'm a size 7 womens and wear size 38 or 39 in cycling shoes. I ordered the size S and couldn't get them over my shoe at all. I would probably size up to size M or L. I'm a small person, 5 ft 2 and 120 lb so the size S will probably work for a child or someone with reallly tiny feet.",0
2,"If you want to add only a very few items to your NapaWalli Wallet this is a good bargain. Once you put items in they are very difficult to remove (even the Drivers License window) and although I appreciate the security that the items are tight, they seem too tight. If I would have invested more than the price point, I would have returned it for another model with a better design.",0
5,"I've had this for a couple of years and it still works great. A few threads have come loose, but that happens with everything.",1
1,"You have to hold your head in just the right position to see clearly. The focus point is incredibly small. And this is not just up and down, its side-to-side as well.",0
1,Looks cheap. Disappointed :(,0
1,"These shirts are made very small, I went a size up and got a Large and they were made for a child.",0
5,"I started wearing Birkenstock sandals to help provide high arch support. In doing so, I was able to clear up a years' long battle with plantar fasciitis. When I found Birkenstock made inserts that would give me the same support, I was happy as could be - not that I don't like my sandals, but there are times when shoes are much more appropriate. These inserts provide that same support to any shoe. Now, my main decision for buying shoes outside of the fashion is to make sure I can put these inserts in them.",1
5,The color is rich and unique. Great quality for the price. Especially velvet ... can’t top it unless you want to pay hundreds by a designer. If you’re in a velvet mood — grab a few. Got tons of compliments,1
3,Fit well but too thin. Great if you’re wearing in place of sweater. Only good as outerwear in warmer weather,0
2,very cheap thin fabric,0
1,Bottom ridiculous so so so small never fit any size US 4/6 even the large one not made for US or Europeen body's,0
3,"The bottoms fit fine, but the top was too big around my rib cage, although fit well for my boobs... no way to adjust.  i like the shorts enough to keep it and either wear with a solid top or try to take in the band ...  pattern is cute. Def seems like it will only last one summer, but the price redlects that and I wasn't expecting much more :)",0
4,"These were great luggage tags! My only concern was where to write the information needed incase my luggage was lost. When I wrote it on the front and back, it smeared. That's the only downfall.",1
5,I love great deal,1
5,True to size! Rich color! I’m 5’3 and 140lbs. I ordered a medium. Super cozy inside.,1
5,The shirt is lightweight and comfortable...,1
1,"MALA calidad! viene demasiado grande y la tela es super delgada, si no fuera por el collar no vale la pena, el collar es bonito pero se rompe facilmente",0
5,Nice thick warm sock. Love that they come in so many colors.,1
4,Feels and fits perfectly.,1
1,Product was not the right color,0
1,Poor quality,0
1,Returned unsatisfied with quality of craftsmanship and vinyl band.<br />What a time wasted!!!,0
1,"First one had the nubes breaking within a month of purchase<br />I contacted their customer support and sent a replacement right away<br />Replacement is also pretty worn out after 4 months of in house use<br />All in all, I just didn’t like the quality at all and how overpriced it is. Not worth the price at all and I won’t recommend it",0
2,"Does not stay up,falls off right away.the decor is also a little lopsided and the felt hat is creased.",0
3,"Pricey, need thicker gauge. But, ok ... and they stay put, if you latch them properly. Be prepared for a mild to moderate adventure at first.",0
5,A friend of mine got this dress for a wedding...I thought it was so cute I had to order it too! Love the classic style and fit of this dress. It is so easy to wear and is made well. The lace portion has 'rubber' - like in a strapless bra - along the top to keep it in place..you could dance your butt off in this. It sits a bit higher waist- maybe just for us bigger busted gals- but it's so flattering. Love it! Can't beat it for $40! Try it!,1
5,nice.,1
3,"The sizes are on the small size.  I easily fit a large in regular boxes, but these are more snug than I would want from &#34;comfortable&#34; shorts.  The fabric is nice though.",0
5,I purchased this as a gift.  She absolutely loves it.  Attached it to her new LV handbag.  Looks awesome.,1
4,"This is a nice set of inexpensive ties. They come nicely boxed. The two I received were nicely made and attractive. One was wider than the other but6 both looked nice. While not what you would see in the C Suite, they are serviceable for dressier occasions like church and date nights. Easy care they are machine washable.  There comes a time when every guy needs a tie. These are affordable, attractive and easy care.",1
1,Not good at all the nuts were wielded  off to side the fork points at a 45%  angle  can not wear!!,0
5,Much more comfortable than the silicone watch band my anu came with.  Impossible to say how durable it will be just yet.<br />I am much happier with my watch with this band on it.  It is a bit of a challenge to put on as it is difficult to get the 2nd spring bar in to place.,1
1,"Got mine in, one was missing a ball.",0
4,Daughter loves it!,1
1,Waste of money and time!  This looks like it was used and returned for a full refund!  I hate that I have to return this to Amazon because the thing should be tossed into the trash can.  The company will probably send it out to the next poor soul who hasn't the foggiest idea what they just bought.,0
3,I got size larger & it was still too small,0
4,Half a size too big but still Great quality and look really good!,1
3,Cute but not what I was expecting!<br />Still cute for summer,0
5,Awesome sunglasses!!,1
2,"Unfortunately, the cute print doesn’t keep it on my head. Adjust it through the night but it slips around on my head and then starts coming off. Constantly.",0
3,The item doesn't look like you're going to picture it looks colder more fake gold it does not look nothing like the picture it looks like like a steak when you receive it and it does not look the same as the picture it cheaper so I was not satisfied and I'm always ordering from Amazon and they are really really messing up big time,0
2,"I was so disappointed. This one was one of the worst.Add did not state size, and you need a magnifying glass to see the details on this.",0
4,"The color and look of the dress on my 9 yo daughter is gorgeous, but it did not go all the way to the floor like I expected. It could just be because she is at the age where she is skinny and getting taller. Otherwise, the dress is perfect for her school pageant.",1
5,gorgeous and delicate what i expected.,1
5,Excellent quality and beautiful detail<br />Had many complements on them I bought<br />3 different  colors. I just couldn't decide<br />What color. Great value also  Vicki.,1
5,Super cute.,1
5,I adore this tear drop.,1
5,Perfect size for travel. Sized for closeness to the body for extra security.,1
5,She loved it. It was a gift,1
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!<br /><br />Horrible!!  The size was way off and the graphics were blurry to the point of not being able to distinguish much!<br /><br />Tried to return but return location is in China and it was going to cost $128 to ship it back!,0
5,Great for my granddaughter,1
4,Great! Just the material is all right,1
5,Wish it was a size chart,1
1,"The skirt is not like the picture.  It is very fluffy,  lots of material & it is scratchy feeling.<br />Super cheap.<br />Would not recommend.",0
4,"Daughter loves it. Won’t take it off, even at bedtime. She’s 5, and it runs a bit big on her, loose everywhere.",1
1,Mala calidad,0
5,"The shirt is cute however, it is not high low and it is not oversized.",1
1,Color was darker then the picture,0
3,"Cute, but too big. Based on other reviews I sized up and it was entirely way too big. I returned this item. The fabric was very stretchy, which I wasn’t too keen on. It’s a fine shirt, but it wasn’t for me.",0
4,Started Squeaking in automatic with in 24 hrs. Its pretty and does ok in the other settings. The only fuzzy logic involved is why they made a claim of fuzzy logic.,1
3,"Great pants, but at least one size too small!  14 was too small!",0
2,The sewing at the bottom of the legs comes out so easily. I wouldn't By again,0
5,Very pleased with product. For as expected.,1
5,It is perfect. May have to buy the blue,1
3,"Loved it. It was very difficut to unscrew the ball from the navel rings and the box is a little small, Howerver, I still love it and wish they had silver ones also.<br />Edit: good for show but the charms come loose if you're doing any type of activity",0
5,Love these glasses.  I've been paying about the same price at a local import store  and they have been flimsy.  These glasses are still lightweight but much more sturdy that my old ones.  I'll be buying these again.,1
3,Fits very well very nice product I love it,0
3,An awkward fit for my body type.,0
1,"Very cheaply made, irritated my ears",0
3,"I bought these shirts for my husband and he loves the fit and comfort of them, however both shirts had a tiny hole in them that we didn’t notice. Until my husband wore one of the shirts and I noticed a run on the back (kind of like a panty hose run) starting at a tiny hole. I then looked over the second shirt that he hadn’t worn and noticed a hole in it as well. I’m disappointed that I paid $20 for two shirts that won’t last very long. Not sure if I will order more.",0
5,Good price uses for gift bags for pen pal kids from school. They loved them.,1
5,This top fits as expected. The colors and pattern are very nice. I love this brand and this one did not disappoint!,1
3,"These key rings are extremely hard to move! If your working with a thicker charm, such as resin, this is not a key ring you want to use!",0
3,"Odd shape. Not sure how to get the front to drape right, like in photo.",0
1,Way too small,0
1,This dress feels like styrofoam and is very long.,0
4,Great for swimming.  Likes that it covered my thighs. Will be great for vacation,1
3,Did not fit well.  Too small.  Tried to return them but too much trouble to ship to UK.  Donated them to Veterans.,0
2,"I wear a size 11 1/2 wide shoe and couldn't get these socks on my feet even with help appliances.  So, I gave them to Goodwill, and maybe someone with a real narrow foot can use them.",0
5,"Perfect napkins, beautiful color and size.",1
3,I loved the shirt but after one wear the alien applique was already pealing off :(,0
2,"Cheap bow, fell apart, but if you only want it for one day like a wedding, will be just fine and is super cheap",0
1,It’s not as wide as it states and it bends so easily. Waste of money.,0
2,Cute style. Very small,0
5,"Compression socks have to be very tight to be effective, and these fit the bill. Also, outstanding customer service.",1
5,Nice cross.,1
5,Really impressed with these lights! They feel durable and they are bright! I would buy them again.,1
1,Regret not being able to send it back.  Too small and not what it looked liked in the picture,0
2,My daughter didn’t really like wearing these as slippers because they made her feet to hot. Super cute though!,0
3,Returned.....I live in Florida. This is very very thick.,0
1,"They hurt and are extremely uncomfortable to wear I totally regret the purchase bc they just sit in my jewelry box un-utilized, wasted money.",0
2,"Mittens are great, hat fits like it isn't cut directional for the face",0
3,I think it would help others to know when ordering that the jeans run larger than other brands.,0
5,My husband has always wore Russell sweatshirts for years.  He really likes them and they wash well!,1
5,Warm n great for texting,1
5,"These are really nice reading glasses and the blue light lens is a added plus! They are very clear and the anti scratch is a must in our home as we have reading glasses everywhere! The metal frames are nice and they feel very sturdy, not flimsy or easily breakable like some. Good for men or women!!",1
4,gift for granddaughter,1
5,Perfect gift for the Westbrook lover. !!,1
5,"As expected, would order again",1
5,"These are great, light weight, unlike some stainless steel earrings, I will definitely buy from this vender again.",1
4,needed something leopard for a costume and this worked great.  Long in the back and the sleeves were just a little above wrists.,1
4,"Laces are well made and were only 3&#34; longer than the originals, however, the extra 1 1/2&#34; on each side makes a big difference.  If your boots require 60&#34; laces, don't buy the 63&#34; laces - too long!.",1
5,Comfortable,1
5,Really cool robe/dress. I will wear it with leggings or shorts and a tank top. Darling!,1
3,"Im not super impressed. Its VERY cute and weighty but even on the biggest snap, i cannot wear it. Its too small. Im a petite female. It should have fit. It is absolutely adorable as a decoration.",0
5,"Cute, comfortable, and inexpensive — I couldn’t of asked for better.",1
5,Exactly what I expected.,1
4,Besides the buckle being kind of confusing these are very cute.,1
2,Order the next size up. They were way too small.,0
5,"I love this set. I bought two sets, one for myself and one as a gift. The only thing I disliked was the gloves are on the bigger side.  It’s  ok though as  I can still wear them. This set is very stylish.  The scarf is an infinity scarf.  I really love this set.",1
4,Strap is slippery I’m trying to find out how to fix it,1
2,These are ok but look nothing like the pictures.,0
2,The more I wear it the more I hate it.  Neckline is choking me.  Fabric is so uncomfortable.Green color is nice.  Beware:  Tag specifically states DO NOT PUT IN DRYER.  Fit is more like a Misses (I ordered XXL) and not a Plus Size.  Sleeves are generously long.  Fabric is 100% polyester -- it's not that soft or comfy.  It's more like an unlined very long hoodie. I wear leggings under it to keep warm.  Neck is high.  This is a modest garment if that's your jam. Don't buy it.,0
2,Looks nothing like the way model is wearing it. She must have on a dress three times bigger tha normal. I am so disappointed!,0
1,The galaxy watch 3 is pretty big and this wristband look way too small on it.,0
2,"I ordered this item for my niece since she likes horses. However, I received a watch that is a turtle instead. The watch part is fine, but beware - you may not get a horse.",0
1,Did not hold up very well.,0
3,I wear ex-large but i guess when coming from other countries i must be a 2-3x......I gave it to my daughter who wears small.,0
5,Very nick. Love the design. Well made,1
5,Easy care & comfortable,1
4,"Not as comfortable as I hoped, but good overall. Slightly itchy/scratchy. Very slightly.",1
2,"They arrived and one link did not function. they accepted my return without and issue, but I would have prefered a working product.",0
2,"Smaller than expected , it was 3 weeks late getting here.",0
5,"Sooo nice. I bought these for my husband, perfect fit, very good quality, and cool color. So soft and comfy. Planning to buy myself a pair.",1
5,So cute!,1
2,Cheap is cheap. It's not very big. It stayed on through the night the first few nights but then I had to start tying a scarf around the edge to keep it in place. If you have natural hair and it is longer than the nape of your neck.. this bonnet will not fit you.,0
2,Not as shown in the picture. Does not cover shoes. More like leg warmers.,0
4,My husband seemed happy with this gift.  Has not worn it yet.,1
5,Nice sun glasses for the price. Great packaging and case.,1
5,This is a completely comfortable sweatshirt.  It is very soft and comfy and I wish I would have bought more than just 1.,1
5,Vibrant and beautiful.  The colors were rich and my husband loved them.,1
2,"I love the idea of this coat for a casual run around but it looks like a your wearing a comforter .. it also arrived with a broken zipper .. I ordered the green, it is a nice color .. probably would look good on a smaller, or slim person .. I’m 5.9 and  ordered size extra large",0
3,"She's loved it! I thought the magnet was week, keeps opening up and the hinges seem flimsy. But for the price, it's great :)",0
5,Love that my daughter can use the zipper easily. Love that they work with her AFO brace.,1
1,Azigongyey Women's Sleeveless Dress Party Dress Elegant Bodycon Mini Dress<br />way too short and tight,0
3,This shirt is absolutely what I expected as far as looks are concerned. It's sort of a sheer material so I had to wear a tank underneath. And it also fits a liiiiiittttttllee bit tigher than a normal large. Still cute though.,0
5,Cheaply made but I love this shirt and so does everyone else,1
5,Would purchase again,1
3,"Good buy for the price.  It's obviously not upscale, but attractive costume jewelry.",0
5,"Excellent shipping, this product took only a couple of days, just in time for Christmas. The product looks just like the picture, thank you for the wonderful customer service.",1
5,Great for organizing when travel. Really good buy,1
5,Love the material and the look. Thank you for making this in the USA !,1
5,"High quality soft fabric, comfortable. I’m impressed!",1
5,This is an awesome watch that will complement your casual look.,1
3,"fabric ok, too short for tunic I'm 5'8",0
5,"This is a very well-made hat, and it<br />will be worn with pride in the future.",1
5,Fits true to size & fabric is very soft,1
1,Cute but they arrived damaged the posts were extremely bent I straighten them enough to use them temporarily until I can get replacements,0
5,I get a lot of compliments on this dress!,1
5,"Stylish, I get so many compliments at work!",1
2,Way small. Size up. But even then.. material is not soft. I could make a better printing.,0
2,Please note that the product is only for one ear. I should have read it carefully before buying and was disappointed when it arrived after a month just as a single piece. It is not very comfortable to wear either.,0
2,"I had to cut off the end of the watch band, but even so, it is too large. Will have to throw away.",0
5,"Look great, feel great. True to size for me. Got the black and am going to order the burgundy.",1
1,This is fake,0
2,cheaply made,0
1,The fabric is scratchy and uncomfortable.  Will be returning.,0
3,"I would definitely not recommend this for a man unless he is quite feminine. I would also not recommend it for tiny wrists or very large wrists. The brown links can be taken off, but that creates a large size difference, and taking one of the latches off does as well. So, there is no way to make a small adjustment to the size, which is a problem. It is a nice watch and comes nicely packaged, but I only see it fitting a few people perfectly. It is either very tight or very loose on my wrist, with the mentioned adjustments made. For reference, my wrist is 14cm in circumference.",0
4,They feel great even at the end of a 12-hour shift. They do leave some interesting patterns on my legs though. Don't plan on wearing shorts for a while after taking them off.,1
5,"I have a thick black tie but I wanted to buy a thin one so I got this one. I like how it looks and how the material is a bit shinny. I included a pic of me wearing it, I should've done a different knot but still like it.",1
3,"My husband really likes wearing them, and I like that you can buy different colors in one purchase as these aren't that common, however he got a hole in one of them the very first day he wore them and the seams seem to be falling apart. The other two seem ok so far, so I may buy them again in the future to see if this was a one time defect, and, if so, change my review then, but as of now I can only give 3 stars.",0
1,The top has this extra slouchy fabric that looks fine in the Amazon pics but is so weird in person. Returning. Just looks off.<br />Fabric was surprisingly fine. Not great but ok.<br />I had the white in a medium. Returned,0
3,These jean are comfortable. BUT they are also have a VERY generic look to them,0
5,Small but love them,1
5,Love this band!  It’s great quality and I’ve gotten so many compliments on it!,1
3,Cute but a little snug around the waist.  Zipper is hard to zip up,0
1,It was very pretty.  But it turned my wrist green.,0
3,LOve the wording ! Average T-shirt thickness . I ordered a 3-4 and feel like it’s maybe on the small size . My 2.5yr old will probably wear it once or twice before it shrinks in the dryer. It fit him perfectly straight out of the packaging and I’ve never met a T-shirt that didn’t shrink in the dryer-  soooo.. we will see . I wish I had ordered a size up,0
2,nice bra design but the fit does not work.,0
5,"Looks exactly like the photo. I have it on my key chain and play with it all the time. Its supper cute, I get tons of compliments on it.",1
2,"The first one, which I returned had a ripped seam in the skirt.<br />Waiting for replacement",0
5,Beautiful dress,1
5,"These brackets really work well in keeping the mask off your face and lips, it's versatile with many different styles of mask, and easy to wipe clean there's, there's plenty of breathing space, I previously bought another bracket and these win hands down, this is a good product. Does fog a bit, but I still like this bracket.",1
1,"I'm an XL (US) but this runs smaller than a typical XL. So, be sure to get one size larger if you're ordering this. The print itself didn't seem durable either.",0
1,It was way to small and so thin looks nothing like the picture looks like a coat in picture and nothing like a coat,0
2,I usually wear a 1x or 2x....I got a 3x and it is too tight. Runs very small,0
1,"Mala calidad, se ponen negros a la segunda puesta",0
3,"Wife wore it for Super Hero event,too snug",0
1,Pants are short... High waters,0
1,Producto de terrible calidad,0
5,"One pieces are the thing right now and I've been struggling to find one for months. I wear a 34G bra, 5'3&#34; size 8-10 in clothes. I ordered the large and Xlarge. Due to my busy size the X-large was the best fit. I love it and I feel comfortable in it. Super cute and you can't beat the price!",1
5,So comfy! Covers butt and belly! Flattering fit will be great w leggings Love it! Nice bit of stretch. Pretty gold zipper and pull. Nicely made.,1
5,Surprised by the quality.,1
5,I purchased this for my husband to wear for his 60th Birthday and our youngest grandsons 1st Birthday Party this last weekend and it fit perfectly. They ended up having similar shirts.,1
1,These do no hold up well. The holes rip. The fabric is not wicking. They are a cute style but only work for walking not real sweaty workouts.,0
4,I bought this bracelet for my soon-to-be 7 year old daughter’s birthday. I was a little hesitant since it came with the “granddaughter” charm but I knew my daughter would love it and I resigned myself to just prying the charm off before her birthday. Thankfully when I received the bracelet I saw that the charm had its own clasp and was extremely easy to remove!,1
1,I liked what it said on key chain,0
1,the fit was not good.  shows all bumps,0
3,"When I first got them they were stiff and had a little extra material around the sides. the band next to the toe kept rubbing into me and feltlike it would cut into me but I just gave it a small trim and delt with it. I eventually decided to use them on the treadmill to break them in and now they fit perfectly. As in no cutting into my foot or nothing. If you asked me if they were worth buying I would say..... yes, yes they were. I hope this helps you out because in the end it's your decision to make.",0
5,Cute,1
5,Great,1
4,"Love it.  Would be nice to have the center divider turned into a zippered pocket.  Otherwise, I really like it.",1
5,True to size,1
1,It arrived late! Once it arrived it was a solid brown shirt in a child’s small. I ordered the teal in an adults x large.,0
5,Love these. Great for any type of hunting,1
5,"Great watch. Inexpensive and looks really nice. I get an insane amount of compliments on it. Light and delicate so be careful, but it's an aesthetically pleasing watch if you're careful with it.",1
5,Great. Came in a timely manner and was surpised because I only thought I was getting one and ended up getting three,1
5,Me encanta son bellas y no molestan,1
1,"These are lightweight water shoes that have zero adjustability. The heel support is hard and scratchy, and the velcro closure leaves the front portion of the shoe all baggy. My daughter complained of heel pain and discomfort the first time she tried them on. This shoe seems better for a wider foot. We returned them immediately.",0
5,"Super cute leg warmers at a great price! They're big on my 5 week old, but will have many months to wear them. The quality is neither great nor terrible, they look nice from outside (loose threads on inside) and keep her legs warm.",1
5,Beautiful and well made dress!  The bodice is lined with cheery fabric and the fabric of the dress is what you'd expect in an expensive women's shop. I got lots of compliments when I wore the dress.  Caution!  When ordering check the sizing chart!  The waist has no give at all (no elastic) and the bodice is for a buxom shape but can be arranged with the criss cross ties for a smaller person.,1
5,It’s everything you wanted for winter pjs! Fluffy comfy and warm! Wish it had pockets but that’s ok. And size up!,1
2,So for a big gal like myself these overalls look ridiculous. So I took matters into my own hands and changed them into pants.  Not bad since they were inexpensive and I can sew. 🤷‍♀️,0
5,"These work out pants are fantastic! Not too thin, high waisted and have pockets. Color is true and I'm literally wearing them right now while I have a day off at home. So comfortable, pockets are a must, and I am going to order more for sure. I have bigger thighs so I struggle to find work out pants that fit my waist AND my thighs, but since these are high waisted I can order the larger size to fit my thighs and not have to worry about the pants sliding down while I work out or wear them through the day. It's a life saver.",1
2,"frankly, this product looks better than a 10 bucks tie. like a 15-20 bucks one<br />however, the knot is horrible, i even used my teeth and a spanner to unzip it but it doesn't work (and vegetable oil)<br />glad i got a normal tie as backup plan",0
5,Good for the price,1
3,"Nice dress but the pockets are awkward. Normally, I like pockets but this dress would work better without them.",0
5,"Beautiful, love the filagree, appear well-made.",1
5,It was a gift for my mother. It looks good on her.,1
4,These sunglasses are excellent quality. Keep in mind ive never spent over $30 for sunglasses before so i couldnt conpare these low end ones to the high end glasses. All in all they do a fantastic job though. Would definitly reccomend!,1
5,"I bought these for a one time wear at my son's wedding, but my husband liked the them so much that he is wearing the tie weekly at church. Great quality fabric and very well built.",1
1,"didn't care for these glasses. they were so flimsy, the arms don't sit tight on your face. I wouldn't recommend these.",0
2,"The package took forever to arrive and the jacket itself is pretty cheap, it got ripped after just 2 days",0
5,Fun,1
5,I've used these on multiple trips and have been very satisfied with them.  Perfect for the beach and the pool.  I've walked around in them for a bit and  have had no issues.  About to order some additional pairs for future trips.,1
2,"So I totally get that this watch was a 30$ budget piece of equipment, and I wasn't expecting the highest of quality from it, but I was expecting a little more than I got. I've worn the watch for approximately one month of normal every day wear, and on the the straps broke, and the &quot;genuine leather&quot; is peeling like crazy, leaving an ugly light brown undercoat. The watch image also led me to believe that this watch was waterproof (which if is not) leaving a foggy watch for multiple days if you get it wet. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautful looking watch, just don't expect a great quality.",0
4,"You get a lot in this package so it is a great value. There were a few rings that were out of shape and being so thin, they are easy to bend and become misshapen. A few of the clasps wouldn't open or the interior pin wasn't long enough so it left a gap. Even getting rid of those, I still have a lot left. Worked just fine for the pieces I was working on and I would buy these again.",1
2,"Looks great,  but.. the screws come loose constantly and has caused my watch to hit the ground a few times but luckily I always notice it. I love this band but have went back to the factory set. Hopefully the company will help me out",0
2,These plugs are actually WHITE/CLEAR. They're NOT soft and flexible. They're NOT easy to get in. I'm giving them 2 stars because they actually arrived on time.,0
2,Nice color-horrible material- hard not soft to the skin /  no stretch,0
2,They look more like earrings. The bar is way to short,0
5, ,1
3,"The product is good but the material is too hot I leave in a very hot city, for me is not gonna work",0
3,Top is much shorter than I thought.,0
4,GIVEN IT AWAY,1
5,Better than expected. Fit great love the color,1
1,way to big and ugly sent back,0
5,My daughter loves these glasses,1
5,THE exact hat worn by Captain Casey on Deadliest Catch.,1
5,"I'm a 32 waist. Got a large, fits perfectly. I'm mostly a medium in most things, so this was a change of pace.<br />Awesome quality shorts. Great look. the pockets are kind of hidden and i dig that. they're short, but not booty-short short. Highly recommend.",1
2,"The jacket fits beautifully and is so warm... but the zipper keeps busting out from the bottom. I do not have time not the patience to return it, im just going to go to seamstress and have the zipper fixed- but damn really? The best jacket. I knew it was too good to be true- Amazon is turing into the new WISH app for adults.",0
5,Super cute...have received many compliments!,1
5,Tener algo diferente y opción d Correa para mi reloj,1
3,Cheap looking!,0
5,This is a really nice workout top; I love that it has the built-in bra; it's great for my fitness walking. I'm not comfortable wearing it for aerobic workouts because it's not that supportive.,1
5,Good for the price.,1
2,Thin shirt but cute,0
5,Came fast looks like the picture she loves them,1
4,"We, like many others, searched and researched the various sources for these cheap party gifts.  Our arrived quickly and none were broken.  They fit well on me, and a little loose on my fianc&eacute;. I can see how the lens might easily pop out but seems easy to fix.  It was a pretty even mix of all colors too.",1
4,Only had it a week and worn most 9f that time. Keeps time very well and has a surprisingly long power reserve. It is a cheap watch but it looks quality and feels like quality on your wrist. Only time will tell how it holds up but right now I am very pleased. I may due an update in a couple months.,1
1,Horrible!  Waste of money!!,0
1,"What a terrible buy THIS was. I bought these for my husband, he had heart surgery and needs these compression socks to help his sore legs. Forget it! I couldn't even get one ON him they are so small. Very misleading, there is NO way these are L/XL, unless they are for a mouse, not a human.",0
2,Instructions are very weak. You have to cut it to size. I spent significant time figuring it out and still messed up the length!,0
2,It’s really hard to read the hands and actually see what time it is. It has no reflectiveness.  And it’s loud.,0
5,"Finally, I can be the devil or fae I always knew I was meant to be.<br />They paint easy, they fit snugly, and they look killer.",1
1,I love this purse but after only one month the zipper broke. I an very disappointed.  Please send a return address for me so I can return for another one because I will not pay for shipping.,0
1,"Do not waste your money. These are so cheaply made, it’s ridiculous.",0
1,Product wasn't sewn on the pull string...poor quality & fabric is rubbed & very thin..,0
1,"Don’t buy this product, I through them away after received.",0
1,Out of the 4 charms. 2 are placed facing the other way which makes it unwearable and useless,0
4,"A little tight, but man I love this shirt. It goes so well with so many different types of pants. I get a ton of compliments overtime I wear it out",1
5,Great shoes for the price. Really comfortable and decent grip when you have to get off your bike.,1
4,"They were a bit of a challenge to get into the ear, then trying to get them to click shut was another issue, they are  better suited for a kid or little person.",1
1,Very thin material  Cheaply made,0
1,would not buy this again. You can't tell what the picture is very disappointed. Was excited to get it but not now!,0
4,This are roomy shorts but fit well.  As described they are not just above the knee shorts.  These are mid thigh shorts.  Great for running and jogging.  For the money I would definitely recommend these shorts.,1
4,Cool look and good quality. Only knock is it sits up high and a bit bulky,1
2,"I like the dresses but they run small, I used the size chart and they are still too small, I wish they fit, they are really cute.",0
4,"Nice, metal accents come loose with use but can be easily fixed with superglue",1
4,Very neat product! It arrived much sooner than expected and was a nice surprise. You get what you pay for.,1
1,I bought this a size bigger so to allow longer use out of it.  It was about 3 sizes smaller than expected.  Have no choice but to return it and try something else.  So disappointed!,0
5,Great for the price. Really pretty and small enough that my mom doesn't feel silly wearing the words mom on her ears :P,1
3,I was very happy with the dress but it shrank after I washed it and it no longer fits,0
4,"Looks good, one pair is blue and other is orange.. I like the blue one.",1
5,"Beautiful dress wearing for a wedding, bought the elegant green one and bride changed mind so bought  thd blush pink.....both very pretty",1
5,"great fit , keeps the boys in one spot",1
5,My husband loves the softness of these handkerchiefs. They are absorbing and soft.,1
2,"Too small, listed as XXL but did not come close to fitting like all my other XXL shirts, had to give it to my son.",0
2,This is a HUGE wallet!! Too big for me.,0
3,"Warm material and does fit true to your standard size, but, I wouldn’t consider this a coat. It’s definitely a sweater, great for layering in the cooler months. It’s heavier material, it’s machine washable.",0
2,too small!!!,0
1,"All latex gloves were damaged and stuck to each other. When separating them or pulling them from the box, they ripped.  I had purchased multiple kinds of gloves and just getting to this box and its now outside of my return window. It appears that the gloves are very old or they were in heat and all stuck together. A big waste of money.",0
5,Good quality as expected cute design . Found for good deal,1
5,"I bought this in a medium.  I usually wear a small in the majority of shirts sold at stores and from the reviews I figured a size up wouldn't hurt. The medium fits perfectly.<br /><br />The sleeve area is very open so I suggest wearing an opaque bra since all can be seen when you raise your arms or wear some kind of tight shirt beneath.  The sleeves are flowy and so is the shirt until it gets to the hips, there the problem may lie where it will sit tight on the hips and the reason a size up is suggested.  My hips are 38&#34; and it sits comfortably with a slight stretch.<br /><br />The fabric is very soft and very comfortable.<br /><br />Casual and comfortable is what I like about this shirt!",1
5,"I've received so many compliments after wearing this dress. Beautiful color and print! And it's very flattering. I usually wear a size Small and ordered the Medium, and it fit just right. It wasn't snug which is what I prefer. Only small complaint is that it wrinkles really fast but I think if you iron with starch then it would be fine. Highly recommend this dress!",1
2,"Clasp doesn't stay buckled, The weight of the product makes it impossible to stay on .",0
2,"They stink so bad, make sure you wash them before using",0
5,great watch for the price,1
5,I bought this watch for my husband and he LOVES it very much!,1
5,Purchased as a gift for someone that loves daisies. Recipient was very happy with Mini daisy earrings gift. Ideal for someone that enjoys wearing smaller earrings.,1
5,Nice quality.,1
5,I needed some addition suction cups to hold items on the windows and these are doing the trick,1
3,I would not recommend purchase. It comes off to me as costume jewelry. Very inauthentic<br />And toy machine like. The glitter falls off. It makes a great jewelry box decoration,0
5,Fits great,1
2,"I have an older version of these socks, and I ordered a new pair in the same size because I was happy with the first pair. These arrived, and the opening of the sock where you put your foot in was so tight, I could hardly get my foot through the opening. There was no stretch at all. Once I got them on, they foot portion fit fine. However, the top part around my ankle fit pretty tight (again, there is no stretch). I have slender ankles, so I can't imagine how tightly these would fit on a person with more average or large ankles. I am not sure if this problem is just a one-off issue or not.",0
3,"Everything was fine, but they came with this spot on it. Have no idea what it was. After cleaning them thoroughly, I like the fit and style. Took points off for the spot.",0
3,Large,0
5,Beautiful heart it's very lovely thank you!,1
4,"Cute, but break if stretched!",1
5,great!!!,1
1,Very cheaply made not worth it,0
2,Not flattering at all. Gave it 2 stars because fabric is warm and cozy but that's about it. More of a Pajama than a shirt-dress.<br /><br />Not recommended... (unless looking for a warm pj),0
3,It’s super cute but... very low cut not like the pic. It almost went to my navel. It’s just a couple quick stitches and it’s fine though :),0
5,Works well on tile and hardwood.,1
3,Bought for daughter she liked. Butt cherkd are more revealing and she expected.,0
4,"Wow, heavy man. Get ready for the next ice age: This product is rated for sub-zero on the Kelvin scale! Wouldn't consider it unless you're well below freezing — and that means in the -20 to -30 range. Easily a replacement for the classic winter buffalo robe: So save a buffalo. Sheer a sheep instead. Can't wait for February and a few weeks of minus 20!",1
4,Got as a gift for my 11 year old niece and she loved it. Strong and pretty well worth the price.,1
3,it  ok for the price would not buy again,0
5,My daughter wears these everywhere. The ears are still straight even through all her rough housing!,1
3,"I love the color and fit of this band. However within one week, the gold button that keeps the band closed began to rust. Additionally, I have had an allergic reaction to this metal portion. I believe  it is made out of nickel because that is one of the only metals I am allergic to.",0
3,"Love the price, quality, and quanity. However, I didn't like majority of them. I guess I was expecting them to be the ones I would choose lol... Its all good or whatever..",0
5,Bought this for my friend. She cried and showed it to me and it’s beautiful!,1
3,"The sunglasses  are very comfortable and it looks great, the reason for only three stars is because after several months I have not been able to do the replacement of the other colors, I think it should be easy to replace the lens is all!",0
2,"The style of the glasses are cute which is why I bought them, but they had to be returned as soon as they were received. The glasses came completely crooked and uneven. They're supposed to flex to fit the growing width of a child's head, but when the glasses came with one of the sides completely askew and stretched way out with no way of fixing them they were unusable. I'm rather disappointed as it's incredibly hard to find a reasonably priced pair of toddler/children's sunglasses for girls that are classy, simple (hold the glitter and neon please), and have UV protection.",0
5,"Holds up to daily wear and tear from my kid....great product, very well built!",1
1,Not worth it! The plastic does not hold the diamond.,0
5,"Very soft sweatshirt in a nice medium weight.  The rose print is beautiful,  not too bright and matched what my screen showed perfectly.<br />This is juniors sizing and fits proper to that.<br />Lastly seller shipped very quickly.  All around goodness.",1
2,not what I expected.,0
5,I made some adjustments and it's perfect now.,1
5,"Provide great coverage and tight fit. Cut to form to the human face, even under the chin. Good nose clips.",1
3,The converters are well made. The size of them are small. I am new to this converter and will order bigger sizes,0
1,not a one size fits all.  chest and arms are cut small. i will be returning it.,0
1,Returned it because really too big. It is hard to know how certain items will fit and I found the fabric to be thinner than what I prefer.,0
5,good,1
4,Wrong size but they would probably be cute if they were right,1
2,I was in need of some new pants for range days and training. When these arrived they looked really nice. I have some courses of fire from kneeling positions so I liked they had the knee pads built in. Those were easy to put in and take out so they could be washed.<br /><br />The only drawback is the sizing. I normally wear a 34 to 36 in my Blauer pants so I went with a 36 pant. That was way off and a more than a few inches shy in the waist.<br /><br />When you order these order a few sizes up and you will be fine.,0
2,Not to happy about them! They say it is for kids but they are very big for a toddler! Not I'm sorry but not happy!,0
5,love this hat this is actually my second one because my last one was destroyed its super comfortable and warm,1
1,the bottom part (crotch) was huuuuge and hangs! Its ridiculous. Love the top tho,0
1,Too small,0
1,This watch looses time. Since the stem was pulled out when I got it i decided to replace the battery which still didn't fix the problem. Now my window for returns is closed.,0
2,"I am a D cup. The support is &lt; than medium. The cup itself i poor quality not strong. I guess I got what I paid for, 2 for the price of one. I gave the 2nd one away.",0
2,Nice shirt. Way too small. I ordered a large and it barely fits my 11 year old brother. I should have taken the warning more seriously I guess.,0
3,The rings did not fit but I love shopping here,0
1,"First of all, this shirt looks no where near as the picture showed. It's not even the same color! Be aware of this before you order it. Now the shirt definitely runs small as stated ...but it runs very very small I ordered only one size bigger then my usual size but definitely should have ordered two or even three sizes bigger then my usual size but it all doesn't matter anyway because even if it did fit right I wouldn't keep it because of the appearance. I was expecting a white shirt with purple pattern as in the picture instead I received a yellow shirt with a multi color pattern",0
1,They are tiny and thin....not what I was expecting,0
3,Is good material but first Too small I couldn’t wear it,0
5,"I ordered the 6-15 month size and they fit my 8 month old perfectly!! I love them! They’re super cute, great quality, and keep her legs warm. As I said my daughter is 8 months old, 20 lbs, 26 inches long. They’re stretchy so they come right above her knee but I scrunch them down to right below the knee and they look fine (no awkward bunching). Love them!",1
1,"See headline above, that says it ALL!!!",0
5,This jacket is thin and light.  Perfect for spring.,1
5,Love it!,1
5,Love it,1
1,The button's were sewn on diagonal line instead of straight and this shirt is literal trash. I do not recommend.,0
4,"Its well made and stayed together, the only thing is I have small hands so it kept turning.",1
4,"The size is too big. There was no option given for sizes so I feel it should be small, medium and large. That would be better",1
1,Not sized right!,0
1,Great idea but that class already broke after first wear Took a long time to get here. Probably made in China and very very cheap,0
2,The color is an ugly green instead of what I thought,0
4,Cute pj’s but they run a tad large so you may want to size down.  Colors are nice as well.,1
1,"I ordered this dress in the black short sleeved version and loved it, so I ordered this in white long sleeve and it was NOT the same. At all. I ordered a L and it barely covered my butt and the sleeves were way too tight.",0
3,Some impovements was made,0
2,The price is right. The fit is right. The bare thread design is a disaster and the reason this sweater deserve 2 stars. The threads are constantly being caught on something and tearing.,0
5,The same as shown in photo. Love it,1
5,Great book must have for intellectuals only,1
5,I'm 5'10 188lbs. 22 weeks pregnant. Ordered an XL. 36DDD. Fitd great with some room to grow,1
5,"So far I like it, I don't get as wet bathing dogs as I do in a smock. Unfortunately, it seems to allow more hair underneath than other aprons, which leaves me covered in hair and itchy.",1
5,I have multiple colors of this brand.  This was a unique color.  I especially like the purse because there is a place for everything and it is not overly large.,1
3,"Product was delivered on time. Only downside they are not as thick as described,you can see threw them.",0
5,"These are so beautiful. Well made, great weight. Would highly recommend!",1
4,Was a lil big. But super soft and comfy,1
1,"Unfortunately I'm disappointed that this bracelet broke quickly. The shipping was outstanding as it had the contact information and was packaged very well. I hope if I buy a similar product in the future I will have better luck, thanks.",0
2,Not sure why anyone would use noisy plastic as a pocket liner,0
1,"At first I was so happy with this band, but it fell apart before a year. I could of lost my Watch when this band broke.",0
5,the dress it is beautiful and i will use it for a party of dress and black code only. it was perfectly wraped.,1
5,Nice bangle bracelet with an easy to use clasp. I will continue to buy Nina Queen items because they are just as nice as the bigger named charm bracelet without the outrageous prices,1
1,I had to return it because the card inside was different from what was advertised. I didn’t like the look of the rose gold either. It was very cheap looking.,0
5,I love them! Only drawback and not a big deal but they need those plastic backs which I have dozens lying around. Still deserves 5 stars though. Other than that they didn't make my ears hurt like some earrings do. The Celtic design is beautiful. I wish there was a matching necklace or bracelet. I would buy these for gifts for my sister and friends.,1
2,"Nice product, size chart is way off.",0
3,"Satisfied, served the purpose it was bought gor.",0
1,This item is very cheaply made my son asked for it for christmas and it broke it one day,0
5,Super sturdy. Will order another pack to travel with as well.,1
1,Wore a couple times and broke.,0
1,Not particularly fond of these masks. They are cheaply made,0
4,Very good,1
1,don't waste your money,0
2,I ordered XL size and they are hard to put on and too tight also at the top.,0
2,"I am 5' 8&#34; and these are too short. After one use they stained from being in the rain (cycling). And they shrunk even more after washing them (machine wash, hang dry). I would not recommend these.",0
4,This is a very pretty dress.  I ordered an XLG because I had a feeling it might run small.  I'm a size 14 which is not normally an XLG.  The material is very nice.  This dress will emphasize your bust line.... wear with caution.,1
5,My previous Bates socks lasted a good 10 years of constant use. I know these will do the same!,1
3,Looks great on model but material isnt what i expected....,0
2,"I purchased two different prints for this specific items and one arrived with no issues to the garment, but this particular one arrive with two holes on the pant leg :-(  .  The fit however, on both pants are terrific!! For me that is crucial because I have found it very difficult to find  pajama pants that have a good length (being 5 foot 2 inches tall). Pajama sets are also difficult so I wind up just buying it separately. Not sure why the other pj pants I bought were fine and this one had holes. I did however read that another customer had the same issue, but I took a chance. Hoping these reviews can get to the attention of the distributor and can be fixed.",0
5,Really cute and soft,1
1,Very very small,0
5,This was really a cute key chain.  I gave this with a couple of other items to my grandsons bus driver at the end of the year.,1
1,This ring has turned to copper color within one month of wearing. I woul like a refund please.,0
2,"The top fits every where except the cup. According to the size chart the large should have for me well. I'm a 36 DD, the cups were probably a Large C at best.",0
5,"These may be the softest, most comfortable socks I have ever had!  I like them better than even the big name brand merino wool sock. Warm, wear well, fit good. I have used for landscape work, athletics, lounging. Unbelievable quality at a low price.",1
1,"They spelled ""Mavericks"" wrong but YOLO.",0
4,A little small but very cool,1
1,Came without instructions for starters. Set the time and date...4 hours later it lost 30 minutes time!,0
3,Its soft and pretty color but doesnt fit as expected and I ordered a bigger size than I usually wear,0
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of this necklace. it is well designed and manufactured. high quality and looks really good.,1
5,"Love love love love love this dress. I got a size small. I'm 5'6, 133 lbs, 34D. It was snug in the chest but it still fit fine. If your chest is larger or you have a long waist, the ribbon waist will come under your chest more like an empire waist dress. It hides your stomach, cleavage, and upper arms if those are areas you are uncomfortable showing. I got a lot of compliments on it.",1
5,loved it for the beach,1
2,Product was much smaller than expected,0
1,"It’s HUGE! I usually wear a large but after reading reviews, went with a medium. I still can’t wear it because the arm holes are MASSIVE!! Just wanted to warn others… it’s an adorable dress but way longer than expected and even after sewing the sides a little smaller… I just can’t find any confidence in this dress. Save your money and find something else :(",0
1,Cheap material nothing like the photo . Very thin material,0
5,My nephew loves this shirt! It's really nice and fits perfect.,1
5,Loved them! They’re really soft and nicely designed.,1
1,"The crystals fell out in the first week of having it, the company sent a replacement which had crystals literally missing. I didn't bother contacting them again considering it's just not a great product. My wife still loves it and wears it all the time. Just wish that both hadn't fallen apart so quickly.",0
1,Not worth $5.00!!!!,0
4,"Good product, had a small hole in one of the pockets and lost a key. Overall good.",1
5,"I loved the color, and the feel of the fabric.  It was my fault that it was crew neck which makes me feel suffocated.",1
5,My son loved it,1
3,Not what I expected at all. Cut short and its made from tee shirt material not of great quality.<br />Shipped fast tho.,0
3,"Shirt was thin and the color was blue instead of black like I ordered. The style is adorable, love the shirt but wish the color was correct.",0
3,These pants are extremely comfortable and very soft. I just wish they weren’t so sheer and see through.,0
4,They only reason for my rate is that it doesn’t say “I open at close” and it could’ve said it… why doe I say that? Because they engraved that it is made in china in the same place where “I open at close” goes…,1
1,Once again. Size chart is not correct.  If i had known I was ordering fekm a China I would have not.  Had this happen before with they're size charts,0
1,Very cheap. Does not look like picture the white is yellowish,0
5,"These sneakers are so cute! The fit was perfect, the platform sole exactly what I hoped! I’m 5”2 and these comfy & stylish  shoes give me a boost without feeling klunky.<br />Highly recommend!",1
3,"Love the color. I buy Swarmy's all the time. But, this pair, the zipper opening for the warmer doesnt go all the way to the tips of your fingers, so the tips are still cold. I dont need the back of my hand warmed, I need my fingertips. I returned. I need the kind with the zipper on the side to put the warmer in, so I can scoot it to the tips of my fingers... I think theyre called the Swarmy Toasters....",0
3,I like that they are easy to take apart and instal but my recent pack the screws in the connectors are I never or stripped because the screw driver provided will not loosen or tighten them so I had one whole set I’m going to throw out. Not sure if I will buy this brand again.,0
5,"Fits true to size. I love how it goes with a pencil skirt!<br />I wear medium,  but if you want a more relaxed fit you can order up one size or down for a more fittedlook..",1
4,Beautiful fit perfect.,1
5,Perfect and reasonably priced.,1
1,these broke as soon as my son put them on for the first time.,0
5,Nice fit for an average adult. Too big for small faces.,1
5,Muy conforme con la compra,1
5,"These are great. I have gone camping in these and they hold up to the dirt and sand really well. Got them soaked in the rain and they dry very fast.<br />Someone even complimented me on how these look. I don't think she knew too much about pants, but OK. I'll take it.",1
5,This dress is flattering and comfortable. The fabric is soft and washes well.  I do find myself wishing that I had ordered down as I am a petite and the dress is generously cut.  Hoping they add more colors as I would purchase it again.,1
5,A great wallet and a great price,1
1,Very pretty but after removing 2 or 3 times off arm it is so stretched it just flips around☹️Not worth the money,0
4,"These are my husband's go-to masks. He likes the fit and feel. Only thing to make them better would be a metal band at the nose.  But other than that, they are great! Good value.",1
1,"Wig was way too small, had to return it.",0
5,Ordered these for my two year old toddler.  Love the colors and durability of the clips.,1
4,"Came vacuum sealed, which helps in the shipping process. Can fit in a mailbox if necessary. VERY soft! Not much fallout from the fabric, but some did. Super warm.",1
5,"Beautiful belt, well made. Would highly recommend to others.",1
3,Very disappointed that the zipper came off the rails and only one side works.,0
5,Loved it,1
2,Too large,0
5,Very beautiful. I love it planning on buying more..,1
3,"I’m not sure if they are too small or I am just a bit too tall for them (I’m 5’11” and ordered the large) but these seemed to fit well and looked great until I started walking or running, when they started to fall down. I could get about a block without pulling them up. Super annoying and they are going back.",0
5,"These are really nice, soft lace and viberant colors.<br /> I am a 36 inch bust, size D, with a 31 inch under bust (i was a 34 inch under bust but lost weight);  So the cup size fits, but not the band size which is not an unusual problem with my proportions. Takeing in the band part of the bralette is easy and takes vary little effort.<br /> My only ture dislike about these is that the padding is vary easy to see threw the lace, as there is not another layer to cover. If you were looking to be able to wear these alone, it'll take alterations or takeing the padding out. If you are looking to wear these under tank tops, or blouses, you won't see the padding.<br /> All in all beautiful, soft and comfy. With some easy taking it these will fit perfect.",1
5,Great fit and fun print! Item arrived on time and in perfect condition.,1
5,"I wish you could see the picture because this t-shirt is beautiful, I just love it.  Good quality, very comfortable, good price",1
2,While they are pretty they are not metal like it says. They are a hard and heavy plastic like material that can't be fitted to face at all..neither of us could use this and now it's not returnable .. things like this should be returnable especially if it's not what was described.,0
5,Dress is so cute on.,1
4,"Lighter color than I expected/pictures. Was hoping for a dark navy. Looks more like a dark teal. Otherwise, met my expectations.",1
4,Use in shower. They don’t slip.,1
5,Thank you good item and excellent seller,1
3,"Okay for the price, does not like the material and the pockets are a bit high in proportion.",0
1,Quality was not  good. Not true to size.,0
2,We haven't even had the shoes a month and now they won't charge. Not happy.  He wanted to wear them for the 4th and now they wont even light up.,0
2,"Tired of looking for these, my first one I didn't keep track of the brand and every one since has had rough edges and destroyed my clothing.",0
1,wasn't a fan of the set. Bottom fit om top as uncomfortable,0
5,I love this! This is my first waist trainer of any sort but for the price I feel as if it was an excellent buy. It does roll down slightly when sitting but it’s nothing I found terribly bothersome. It takes a bit to get use to I will say and i am still trying to get use to wearing it. I bought it mainly to provide some support for my back and encourage me to not slouch and I will say it does the job well. I used it at work while lifting heavy things and it provided great support and I wasn’t sore the next day like I usually am from the heavy lifting. I don’t suggest eating with it though it can be uncomfortable in that aspect. The only flaw I had was one side of the side straps wouldn’t stick so I can’t put it as tight as I might want on some days but I feel for the money it was worth it for me. Very pleased. You will need to measure yourself for accurate sizing,1
5,Great affordable hoodie. My son loves it. Fits true to size.,1
1,Not long enough throughout the mid section. Poor quality.,0
5,They look great and the fit is perfect.,1
5,Love love love my phone case!,1
5,Great socks. Fit perfectly. Breathe well.,1
1,"I bought an XL and it fits like a small, there's no stretch at all!",0
1,Green skin from these,0
4,"The product arrived on time and securely packaged.<br /><br />The bracelet was as expected from the pictures. I was a little worried about it looking cheap, but the overall quality is fine for the price point. I also thought the finish on the bracelet was accurately described in the pictures.<br /><br />Overall, I was happy with my purchase. It was a good deal for both price and quality.",1
2,"Posts both bent flat to earring upon delivery...it was odd considering they were in a padded envelope, inside a box (alone) with those big air tube things. They snapped right off when I attempted to bend them back. They get two stars only because they were cute. Disappointed to return but we all know the old saying about getting what you pay for... They could not possibly have gotten bent in transit.",0
4,It was tricky to use at first but it didn’t take long to get the hang of it.,1
1,fake,0
5,"Good quality and cheap, they are literally the same ones you can get from like hot topic or Spencer’s but for $8 cheaper.",1
5,"This was my 4th top of this kind and I only had one delivery mishap, which happened to be with this pink one. It fits and wears well, hides my areas that I'm self conscious about (extra large chest [36F], armpit/back fat), and is beautifully chic! With prime I exchanged the damaged item for a new one without any problems!<br /><br />A must have in many colors!!!!",1
3,"The shoe is very expensive for rather cheap materials. They are comfortable, very lightweight and a nice professional look. I have a very high arch and the top band starts to irritate (leave imprint) after a few hours. I don't do uncomfortable, so I bring a pair of flats along to slip into. For the price, I would not buy again.",0
3,"Cute dress, stretchy with some give. However, it does run small. Get at least a size up. It fit as a medium for me (5'7&#34; and 140) but completely smushed my chest because of how tight it was. Wish I went up a size!",0
5,Didn’t realize they were winter headbands when I bought them!! Super soft and thick. Great for winter runs,1
1,Arrived broken. Back was completely off and pearl fell off right away. Not worth it.,0
3,Medium look just like a large,0
3,Not worth sending back.The material is ok.Nothing as described.The fit is big and not a flattering dress.,0
5,Love it,1
1,Terrible product. Looks cheap and fits very awkwardly.,0
1,"Watch has already quit working, the light comes on but hands don’t move. It would be nice to receive something that does what it is advertised to do. Is that to much to ask for.",0
5,Gift and she loves it. Gave it to her a year ago and it always gets good compliments.,1
5,the most flattering stylish one piece suits I've ever owned.  Extremely supportive for a one piece and the ruching across the stomach is very flattering. Love it! I have 2!,1
2,As you can see in the second image a clip is missing. This is very poor quality control on the part of the manufacturer. I will keep them and take the loss. They are water proof and I had to wear them in the rain. Let me see how they perform and how long they last. I will not buy anything made by this brand.  2-1/2 stars.,0
5,I would highly recommend this handbag!  It was exactly what it showed.  It was also delivered in great condition.  Love the soft exterior leather and interior fabric!,1
1,Very disappointed with order/outfit! Ordered a 3T and shipped to a friend for a present and they received a 6-9month size. They don't have the means to ship back and now they're stuck with a really small size. ANNOYED,0
1,The body of the shirt was snug and the arms were way to baggy. It was the oddest fit ever. The material is very artificial feeling and not comfortable to wear. The color of the sweatshirt was very washed out and not representative of the picture they show. Horrible purchase.,0
1,These earrings are terrible. The backs pop off super easily. The slightest touch to the earrings makes the backs pop off. So much for them being secure.,0
5,"I have a 6 3/4 size wrist and older eyes :) the combination of 44mm case/dial size & color along with the big arabic numerals makes it easy for me to read the time. As with most Seikos I have to use my reading glasses to see the day/date complication unless I'm out in natural sunlight. The image shown is the wrong one, I've included images of what the watch really looks like.<br /><br />The dial is a beautiful beige/cream color, there are lume pips at the numbers only (the 12 o'clock has a triangular lumed pip for refgistration), the hands have lume as well and is long lasting; I can make out the time in the EARLY morning hours when I awake!<br /><br />I have not bothered to adjust the time, I've used it for 1 month and it's gained 30 seconds; this 4R36 movement is fairly accurate. I like the fact that the SRP635 can be hand wound and the seconds hand can be hacked, the crown is approximately 7mm in diameter and is easy to grip. This watch has an open display on the back so you can view the movement in action!<br /><br />NOTE: The description of the Movement is wrong, this is an automatic not an Analog quartz as listed.<br /><br />I find that most OEM bands are too big for my wrists so I removed the canvas strap & put this watch on a Moose Straps Nato; the band width information on the chart is wrong as well; the band width is 22mm not the 20mm that is listed.<br /><br />I measured the lug to lug length and it is 51mm, this covers most of my wrist but doesn't jut over the sides, the 13mm case thickness is not an issue when wearing long sleeved shirts etc. I tend to wear watches higher up (just behind the tip of the ulna more towards the forearm) so rotating my wrists for tasks doesn't cause the watch to bind/restrict movement.<br /><br />I plan on keeping/using this one for a very long time!",1
4,"Be sure to check the measurements before purchasing. The difference in sizing is substantial. I only went 2 sizes up, and it still was not enough.<br /><br />The material was thinner than expected,  but I like the suede-like feel of the vest and belt pouch.",1
1,"This pair of pants wouldn’t fit. Upon opening the package, I initially thought these were made for children. I would love for companies to understand that we women do not all wear a size 4. We are not all “straight up and down” from a shape perspective.",0
1,Does not look at all as described. It cost 20 dollar’s to return.,0
5,Love the height. My daughter loves the shine of the boot.,1
5,"It was a gift, the person loved it",1
3,Fabric is nice but the robe is not true to size.  It runs smaller so you will want to go one size up from normal.,0
1,This suit was tiny!  It runs much smaller than typical suits!  I am unable to wear it!,0
5,Perfect for my Mario costume!,1
5,Love the colors and I find it quite useful for me.,1
2,"They r definitely cute,medium compression, TTS 4 the brand. Sadly they are c thru if u squat, the zipper is difficult & the fabric pilled & I know they won't last. If u have $ 2 spare, then I'd say they r a gd deal, just b/c they r unique looking.",0
2,"these did not fit at all, my 12 month old had a wide & chubby foot. Never used them.",0
5,I got the pink and black in large. It fit as expected and is super comfortable. I can wear them out when I need to run a quick errand. The pockets are deep so I don’t have to worry about my things falling out and there is an additional vertical pocket inside that make great for holding money.,1
5,"Great value for the money, basic goggle with two lenses.  Swapping lenses is super easy, and it's easy to keep the spare lens in a coat pocket when conditions are variable throughout the day.  Would buy again.",1
1,Looks cheap in person,0
5,"Very nice, heavy feel. Reel is tight and can hold up several badge attachments.",1
3,Im giving this a three star. Well the watch is a beautiful piece. Yes a large face btw. But i received my watch not working. Had to take it to a jewlery store to replace the battery.,0
5,Classic!!!,1
1,Sorry I did not like these earrings. Returned them.,0
4,No complains  especially for the price.,1
5,I have also paid around 10$ for a pair just like these the material is a little cheap but still great for the price and the glasses are cute!,1
5,I have received compliments while wearing them.,1
4,Simple but class,1
5,Awesone,1
5,They’re so nice and soft and comfortable to wear. Definitely a good gift for yourself or someone else. I love them so much.,1
3,"Socks were exactly as I expected, good quality good fit. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the amount of time it took to get them.",0
4,This watch band makes wearing and removing the watch a fair bit easier. I've got larger hands and it really saves time and frustration.,1
4,"This shirt is awesome, besides the fact that it's totally see through. Though it fits well and I love wearing it!",1
1,The first order I returned to Amazon due to a 1.5 inch hole in the seam. The replacement order has a cut in the handle. I will either need to return or repair by sewing multiple zig-zag stitch in order to make the cut area stronger.,0
4,Very nice and fit well.  Not as dark as some I own.  Will be best for light hazy days.,1
4,"Excellent shorts, I have several from Costco, this pair was sized wrong.",1
1,Extremely rough & smelled weird. Returned.,0
5,"This is a flattering dress.  I love how comfy yet stylish it is.  The material is thin and soft (like t shirt material) but not see-through, which makes it the perfect summer dress.  I wore it to a bbq party with converse shoes.  It was perfect.<br /><br />Oh I love the pockets, too.  I thought the dress would look funny with the weight of my 5&#34; phone but it was fine.  I almost forget my phone is there.  My phone fell out of it a few times when I sat down, though so the pockets are not deep.  I think the way the dress sits, that can't be helped.  I am willing to deal with it.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase and can see me wearing this dress more just for the comfort and convenience.",1
2,Slimmer than pictured.,0
1,Probably the most uncomfortable glasses I have ever tried.... I couldn't see myself riding my bike for hours feeling that pain....,0
2,"Tried to put it in the second time, it fell apart",0
1,Very cheap looking.,0
5,I love this purse it's perfect for what I needed,1
2,"poor quality to magnetic claps , falls off very easily. thin  metal",0
3,The color is not as pink as I thought that it would be. It's more like a peach color.,0
5,"These are AMAZING. I didn't get them for free, I got them via Amazon Wardrobe to try on and I immediately added a second pair to my cart when trying them on. So comfy and they are not just PJ bottoms, they are really nice for lounging, running errands, or just everyday wear.<br />It's got the comfort of sweatpants but without the insulation. Wore them on a real hot evening and stayed cool. Thick fabric, and they feel really well made.",1
2,Fit was to small compared to other clothes of the same size.  Get a size biger!,0
2,"The only reason I gave this luggage 2 stars is because it 'might' survive it's first journey.  Minimal aluminum, maximum cheap plastic.  The locking devices will almost certainly break off the first time they receive any kind of hit during handling.  You better buy a good set of luggage straps if you decide on this model.  Also, after you receive this inferior product and realize it is basically a piece of plastic garbage, you will find the return policy likely includes a 15% restocking fee, warnings that the return will be rejected should the product not be immediately resellable, and YOU pay the shipping fees.  This is likely the worst online purchase I have made in years.  I will give an update after my first flight.",0
5,The hoodie arrived in a timely manner and packaged properly in new condition. The material wasn't discolored.  I ordered this for my teenage son in a Medium and it fits well.  He is of average athletic build and tall.  I am unsure of shrinkage as I tend to hang dry everything.,1
3,I bought this product specifically because they were described as low rise waist line. They are in fact very high rise waisted.,0
5,Best 20 dollars I spent on Amazon! Needed something fun for a night out in Atlantic City... this was perfect 😂,1
5,We bought this for a Waldo costume to match the Wanda costume we already had. This was a better hat than came with that costume. I only needed one hat but it worked out great since our little one wanted a hat to match.,1
1,Stone fell out day 2.,0
3,The dress is a nice dress I must say however the top don’t look anything like the picture. The sizing is great I’m glad I didn’t buy a bigger size. I brought a size bigger than what I am and it was perfect. Not to happy though with the top cause it don’t look the way the picture says.,0
3,"Get a size larger because they were a little tight for a medium. Especially if you wash them. Don't machine dry them because they will shrink and be even tighter. Even if you machine dry them once and hang dry them from that point on, they will not fit as comfortable.",0
5,Fit great!,1
4,Comes up high on my waist but they are very soft and comfy!,1
5,"LOVED IT! very sexy.. hugged my body perfectly! the grey came out a bit lighter than picture, but it's okay. the outfit was still nice and. the quality of the material was very thick and nice.",1
2,The color of the hat I ordered was different than the advertised picture. It was suppose to be &#34;olive green&#34; which is the reason I ordered.  I received a chocolate brown hat.,0
2,"And there are CAMELS, HORSES, and STINKY CHICKENS in that barn.<br /><br />I cannot imagine any way to get rid of the smell; AND I SHOULDN’T HAVE TO!!!! SHAME",0
2,Is OK  looks a bit on the cheap side,0
1,"These look really unnatural! i would never wear them out. They are very lightweight so they don't even hang downwards all the time, and if they move, the whole hoop moves along with your earlobe, instead of pierced earrings that kind of roll side to side when you move, if that makes sense. At least having tried these, I know that I'll never be able to wear hoops unless I get my ears pierced, or the hoop is hanging from a little chain or something.  The goldtone also looks cheap, though I expected that, of course.",0
1,They came broken and the wires were tiwisted. As soon as I open the box one lens was not even on the glasses. What a disappointment.,0
5,"Perfectly priced.  Cute.  Received many compliments.  Kinda big, but not too big. Different and unique.",1
3,"Looks great and doesn't fall apart easily. I dont know if anyone else has the same problem or it's just me, but the white one turns a different color after wearing it for a bit. Even the black ones turn a different color but it's less visible due to it being black.",0
1,The wires twist and bend. They have to adjusted several times a day. Not happy with them at all. Would not recommend,0
5,My Granson loves it and it is adorable,1
2,"Loved the look, but it was way smaller than an extra large!!!",0
1,Not a good fit at all! I took the straps off and was not pleased at how it looked on me. Does not stay up without straps.,0
5,Very nice but runs big,1
1,Breath on them and they will rust.,0
2,It was cheaply made and wasn't flattering at all. It didn't have shape to it and the stitching was already coming apart before I even put it on.,0
1,Got very weirdly and the material wrinkles easily,0
4,"Super cute dress, I really like it. I’m 5’4 and it’s a bit long for me but I’ll just wear some heals and I should be good, other than the length the it fits gray, very true to size so order what you normally wear.",1
3,"imagine when you put this crop top on and raise your hands, the top will fly up.",0
3,"Typical decent quality and nice colors but straps are much too long for small/medium wrists. I have it on the 3-4th smallest notches and the excess strap reaches all the do you back if the watch face, which is uncomfortable. Needs to come in smaller strap sizes.",0
5,"A great hat, waterproof!",1
5,"I am 5'5, 220 pounds, size 20, 40D. This dress fit perfect. I wish all dresses fit this well! The dress is so lovely and full. The fabric felt like quality material but it was still soft and movable. It felt professional but cute.",1
3,too small,0
1,This was cheaply made I got it an was alread damage.,0
1,"These are very poorly made (one pair worn once, and washed in washer once), material separated from side seam, leaving several large holes.  Don't waste your money on these.",0
5,"I loved this. The bracelet was just as cute in person as it is in the pictures. I ended up giving it to my grandmother because she has smaller wrists, so it aligns better and looks better on her. The way it wraps around, it is for a smaller wrist. My only problem with the bracelet is that you can not use the clasp on your own. It is too difficult to use it. This is not that big of a problem though, because the bracelet does wrap around the wrist, nearly two full wraps for my slightly larger wrist and a little over two wraps for my grandmother's smaller wrists.",1
5,"though it took a whole month to get here, I love these!!!!!",1
5,Great fit and good looking.  As a vet I will wear it with pride.  [[ASIN:B00J3QR2BM Cold War Veteran with Ribbon Cap]],1
5,nice...,1
2,too big - fits weird on the ar.,0
1,This item was wore out before it got to my house. Cheaply made.,0
2,The idea is cool but it arrived with pieces unglued and hanging loose. I didn’t expect perfect but getting something that was well wrapped but still damaged was disappointing. Would not recommend.,0
5,"Was a little scare since I read that it came smaller than expected, but still went with a small. I'm 5.2"" tall and weight 112 lbs and  it fit perfect. Going to wear it at my little cousin quincenera. The fabric is stretchy and not cheap looking.",1
2,"I bought these for my cat loving granddaughter. They were big for a 2 year old and have a permanent and annoying sticker on the lens. I thought it was removable, but it is permanent.",0
5,Sweet,1
2,"I really wanted to like this dress. The chest was too tight for me and it was entirely too short. For reference, I am 5’10” and about 210 pounds. I normally wear a size L, but got an Xl In this dress.",0
5,Perfect for a tassel project I'm working on. Very happy with these!,1
4,Look as advertised but will not stay up on ear lobes as crawlers should.,1
2,"Nice safety glasses but let’s be clear.  These “safety glasses”<br />-have no Z87 rating,<br />-are described as polarized lenses but are NOT polarized,<br />-I ordered the grey with clear lens and received the pink/red with clear lens (as others have reported),<br />-do NOT fit over my eyeglasses (but I have large eyeglasses) as the other safety glasses I have purchased previously (Gateway Safety 6980 Cover2).  I have purchased over 6 pairs of the Gateway’s but I would not recommend the RIVBAO glasses.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Get the Gateways and skip these.",0
4,Love this dress so much I purchased a second one in Navy,1
5,This choker here is awesome!  I bought another one at the 99 cent store and was thinking how i got ripped off here but the 99 cent choker is literally a choker it was very itchy and was very tight on me . This one right here is perfect is is stretchy and very comfortable i wear it no lie like 4 times a week i turn it around to a different color every time.  I love it i recommend it!,1
5,Very nice.,1
5,It was exactly as described.  Grandson absolutely loves it.  And it came fast.,1
3,It was a little tight under the arms and the quality of the flannel was just o.k.,0
3,"Fit more like a 2XL when it clearly says 4XL. Was planning on giving it as a gift, but kept for myself because it was extremely small.",0
3,I loved the pattern and they were soft to the touch but they had very little stretch to them as I was expecting. I have several pairs of this brand and style from TJ Maxx and other places and they all have stretch but these didn't. The XL just didn't work out.,0
1,"Length was not as long as I wanted, but also the cutting / sewing seemed to make the top hang like it was twisted. The shoulder and side seams were not sewn symetrically, was obvious not only to me the wearer, but to others who saw me wear it.  The front of the top had one side lower than the other, and when hung, the center of the front panel and the center of the back panel are not hanging parallel.  A poor job of sewing.",0
4,I love the color and texture of these. The bottoms fit well but the top is probably too small for me.,1
5,Good luck in love,1
3,"I love this dress, however its too small. I always order up a size or two, but this was too tight in the chest and didnt flow like i had hoped. I had to send back :(",0
3,"The color is gorgeous, the packaging was great, delivery was fast, the dress is a bit too small.",0
5,Love them,1
5,Fits great! My daughter loves it.,1
3,They fit as expected but the look is more like thin PJ'S. I won't be wearing them out anywhere.,0
5,"SO SO SO cheap for the quality! I was astounded when I got this in the mail, A. because I had ordered it in my sleep and had no idea until after I got it and B. because it's ridiculously adorable! It doesn't look exactly like the picture (mind is a little darker and the ears are a little rounder) but it's all for the better.",1
2,To small,0
2,Chinese/US sizes: they send extender hooks and eyes which are a pain in the butt. Will not order again.,0
1,The earrings was supposed to be stainless steel but the metal infected my earlobes.,0
1,Clearly stated on the site that it had a lobster clasp and instead had a spring ring type of clasp.,0
1,The texture was weird hated how it looked,0
5,"This is my first UNTUCKit, and it won’t be my last.  Amazing fit and feel!  Teacher budget makes it birthday and Christmas gift opportunities for me.",1
4,"Very nice, exactly that's what I expected from this brand that well look good like them very much",1
4,Pretty necklace but it tends to catch on hair and certain clothing.,1
4,"Fits well, looks nice. Zipper gets stuck where the band of lace is. Had to have help getting it zipped. Also it says it can be ironed, but be very careful!",1
3,"This dress was pretty but ran quite small, I returned it",0
2,Really big.,0
5,This is a very nice wallet but the magnet clasp does not securely hold if using an iPhone 6/6s. It would fit an iPhone 5/5s. I contacted the company & they are ordering additional sizes & told me to check back in the future.,1
1,The band does not fit the Apple Watch Ultra I tried several times but was concerned it would break/scratch my watch,0
5,Exactly what I wanted for a specific outfit.  Colors were just as pictured and the quality seems fine.,1
3,Meh,0
5,"Super nicewatch band. Well made, great fit and finish, stylish, integrates well with Gear Fit 2, great locking mechanism",1
5,"Very cute pants, love the style",1
2,No me gusta,0
5,"Don't freak out when you open the package. Try it on! It's lovely, flattering,  and fun.",1
5,"This is a great, comfortable dress! The fabric is stretchy, and the fit is modest and easy to wear. I'm definitely buying more colors. I'm an XXL could probably wear XL because of the stretch.",1
5,I want this in every color! Going to be great for those fall days that start out cool and end warm and cool down again.<br />Super soft and cozy!,1
3,Too long and too big. I am 5ft and 95lbs for reference. It makes me look wide and boxy...,0
5,"Rose gold 16g 6mm very small ring purchased. I was nervous ordering this size because I didn't know what size fit my helix piercing. However, it fits perfectly! The clasp is very secure and discrete so you don't have to worry about adjusting it a certain way to hide a clasp. Comfortable and just the right size.",1
3,Great material but too small.,0
1,Runs abnormally small. I weigh 125lbs 5'1. It's tight on my calf. FORGET THE THIEGH LOl.,0
5,Rare beauty. Wife loves it. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship.,1
5,Best purses and wallets ever!,1
5,I have been using the watch for a few days and I would have to say that it's a great help. I tried the bezel a few times and it does take a bit of getting used to. The watch is very accurate and is easy to reset. Seller was very responsive and I got the watch earlier than expected.,1
2,This item is not compatible for above average sized feet. Very poorly made.,0
3,"I like the design of the earrings but they are somewhat heavy. If they were a little bit lighter in weight, It would be much better.",0
2,Too small,0
3,love this but it doesn't stay in the folded position when wearing.,0
4,These are super stretchy and soft material. Not for warmth but these would be good for hiking,1
4,"It is large (2.1&#34;hx1.5&#34;w), and very beautiful.  I'm enjoying it, but it is a bit heavy for a long day .. I can feel it on my neck.  Beautiful though, and certainly unique. It's a great blue too. Great with denim.",1
2,"All 3 of those Venus fly Traps died. Seriously angry,disappointed",0
5,"High quality, well made! I love it!",1
2,Must be a made overseas product because its cut too small... I wear an XL USA and would have to order a 2X to fit correctly. I missed the deadline to return.,0
5,she loved it,1
5,for gdson and he is pleased with purchase,1
2,"Somewhat smaller than the size I bought would have been. I believe the measurement was wrong. Again the zip is on the left hand side, Why?",0
1,Would not recommend this purse. Looks very cheep. If I can I plan on returning it. Don't waste your money!,0
5,Great product,1
1,Very low quality silk screening or iron on graphic.,0
5,"Great sandals. The arch is a little higher than rainbow sandals, but they took almost no time to break in.  Bottle openers also work wonderfully",1
1,too heavy!,0
5,I got lots of compliments on this necklace very soft pastel colors very feminine,1
5,Loved these! Super comfortable and still holds you in some. Great for the price!,1
1,"I am xxlarge, it fits for large size person, I gave it to my sister who is medium size.",0
3,It was very cute and I loved the material. I am normally a 12 or 14 and I ordered the 14/16 size thinking it would be plenty big. Wrong! Way to small in the bust and way to short!,0
1,Al dejar durante la noche para. Se retrasa el minutero. Sin una semana de uso y sin golpes cae una perilla del reloj. Total decepción. No vale la pena. Quisiera devolver....pero me resultaría más caro. No recomiendo.,0
2,the band faded and twisted. ended up putting a new expansion band  for 12.75....then the battery failed after 3 months.,0
5,nice bracelet -as described,1
2,"Not the same dress as the picture. Mine is short in the front and long in the back with large pokadotas not small as the picture shows. It is also cheaply made and somewhat see through, 2 star bc it's a great bathing suit cover up but purchased as a dress.",0
1,I ordered a medium and it wouldn't even fit over my head . I usually wear a medium comfortably.,0
2,Cute print. The fit is off. Make sure you size up!,0
1,Awful new design. I loved my old ones with the stretchy straps. These ones have plain cotton straps with wide set and TINY armholes. Super uncomfortable and fall off your shoulders all day long. Never again.,0
4,"I loved the color and design of this blouse but after reading the reviews with a China distributor, I was told to order up a size. I did and it was more than baggy, the criss cross design at the neck wouldn't lay down on my chest area, it bunched badly and the shoulder holes were in the wrong place. I returned it and didn't order another because I was afraid it still wouldn't work. I understand Chinese clothing makers tend to go very petite on things, but for me that was not the case in this blouse. For reference, I'm 5'7 135 or 140 lbs.",1
1,Hook broke as soon as I took it out the packet n tried to wear it... didn't even get to wear it once waste of my money,0
5,Loved my Christmas caps!  They are so cute! Good material too,1
2,My fault shorter than i expected..,0
1,Ridiculously small.  Joke,0
5,I like it,1
4,"These weee great for my costume, but please note these run small. I was able to get my hands in, but it was very tight. Buy a size larger than you think you’ll need to fit properly.",1
1,Should know better all clothing is made to small.,0
5,I've had my hat for over a year and am still very impressed with it. it has held its shape well.,1
3,Bottoms for great. Top is not made for busty girls. It looks terrible.,0
3,Very cute as pictures but access to diaper is very hard. Zipper is hard to zip and taking feet out is also inconvenient.,0
3,"It's OK for the price.  I don't do high-impact work-outs, but I suspect this bra wouldn't give enough support.  The padding inserts do not give enough coverage and move around too much, which is my main complaint.  This is good enough for what I need, but I wouldn't recommend to those who demand more.",0
5,Bought these for my daughter and they are cute and she said they are the most comfortable bra she has!,1
4,I ordered a size up but they are loose in certain places also very unflattering in the front from being too big,1
5,"Got this last minute gift for 30 year old guy. He loves it and gets a lot of compliments. It looks really sharp and is very light. It's a cool piece. I paid $35 and I thought that was fair. The price has gone down a little so I'd say it's a very good deal. Great, practical gift for a stylish man.",1
1,It kept coming loose. Concept is good if all ur keys are house keys that dont have a thick plastic top.,0
1,Beautiful fabric wish it fit! Runs small,0
1,The spelling on the shirt was wrong🙄,0
1,"I'm am not a bigger size person, but I mean that fit is for a doll! Wayyy to small",0
5,"I love this dress! It is so soft and wrinkle free. Perfect for packing, takes up little space and it’s a grab and go. It’s flattering and accentuates your curves without being revealing which I love! It dresses up and down. I’ve worn heels and pearls for a more formal look. I’ve worn sneakers and a Jean jacket for a casual look. I’ve worn cowgirl boots and danced the night away at a Kenny Chesney concert. It is so comfortable and lightweight that I could wear as a nightgown. I also love that it hits mid calf. As a middle aged women, I don’t like wearing dresses above the knee with bare skin (just a personal preference, my legs haven’t aged well. Lol) so it is the perfect length to go from casual to formal. Also, I travel a lot and it comes right out of the suitcase and goes on, no fuss no wrinkles. It’s the perfect dress! For reference, I am 5’2” and 160lbs. I ordered the black in xl.",1
5,these are awesome- bought these a couple years ago- 4 pr just but 2 more-,1
5,Love it,1
2,One of the bracelets was missing the charm,0
5,nice and doest rip shirt like other shirt stays,1
5,Great for painting with toddler. One is for home and the other goes to grandma's house. Light weight and durable..,1
2,"I am so disappointed that this bra didn't end up fitting because it is honestly very pretty and soft. My rating is mainly based on the information from the product listing and the seller (In the Mood Intimates) because the bra itself seems well constructed. The band is very firm which would be excellent for support.<br /><br />I have owned a lot of Parfait bras and was somewhat confident that I knew the size I needed but would have preferred to check a size chart because I was seeing US sizes listed and was under the impression that the bras are usually listed in UK sizing. I was nervous buying from a seller that wasn't fulfilled by Amazon especially knowing that returns were unlikely to be free if sizing wasn't what I thought. It turns out the seller I purchased from charges a $10 restocking fee and doesn't do exchanges, which was not listed on their policies page on Amazon. This seems pretty steep considering how likely people may be to need to return this bra so I don't think I will be reordering.<br /><br />I don't know if it would have been easier to buy this bra if I was a more traditional cup size but I wouldn't suggest buying it from this seller, it would have cost me just as much to buy from a different website or an amazon affiliated retailer and I would have been confident that I could return it to try to order another that way.",0
2,The seams that are supposed to add support end up just irritating. wish there was a liner.,0
3,I love the color and the stretch of the material. However if you’re looking to avoid camel toe these are definitely not the pants for you. Also I would recommend to order a size up,0
5,"I love the product very much!! It is a good quality and well made. I am going to use it a lot in my pool this summer.<br />I also love the very professional and elegant packing, the elegant pink note that made me feel very special as a customer, thank you! It is very rare in these days to be receiving a good quality product, and to have a great customer service. I will order again another one, the multi colors one.<br /><br />Thank you!",1
5,This bracelet was exactly what I was looking for and the vendor was very helpful.,1
4,"This is a good wristlet with some design flaws.  The bill slot is on the credit card side when it should rightfully be on the coin-holder side.  Who wants to unzip both sides at the cash register?  Also, i agree with the reviewer who said that the card slots were too tight.  i can say, though, that this issue gets better with time as the product gets worn in.  Neither of these things would make me return this wristlet. It suits my needs, there is simply room for improvement.",1
2,The hat came all folded up and it ruined the brim of the hat. There are 4 large creases and it seems like there are cracks inside. I don't think it can be fixed and the creases look strange when I wear the hat.,0
5,Love these sweats. Old school quality from top to bottom.,1
1,One wash fell apart,0
1,Broken when shipped,0
5,Love these reading glasses. Wanted to keep the blue light from keeping me from sleeping. Excellent vision. And it’s not so easy to find 3.0 reading glasses.,1
3,"I wear 16 in pants and figured XXL would either be too big or fit just right.<br />Completely the opposite. Couldn't get them up all the way.<br /><br />The material is soft and thin (breathable). It's a little shiny, which I liked. But I'd call these more of a L than an XXL.",0
5,Protected my face from the sun while on the beach for several days.  Comfortable and breathable.  Great looking hat as well.,1
5,Really cute,1
4,Arrived as promised and better than I anticipated - Very classy looking.,1
2,Lighter than expected kinda feels like a toy,0
2,Draw string serves no purpose on and neither does the elastic.,0
5,"This is a nice looking set, as it can be very versatile. We purchased for the bow tie, but pleased with the quality of all.",1
1,It doesn’t look as good as it does in the picture. There were no cut outs on the sides.,0
5,Nice sandal with lower heel. I ordered my usual size (6M) and they fit perfectly.,1
5,"Expected this to be thin, flimsy mask.  It is not.  It is very, very nice and strong.  Not heavy and fits both male and female faces nicely.<br />If you are looking for a simple mask, this is a great one!",1
3,The dress was a lot bigger than I expected but the seller was very good about fixing my issue.,0
1,really a very cheap piece of junk worth about 0.05,0
1,I would return if I could .,0
1,"I could not even get this outfit closed, and it fit horribly small chest-wise. Within an hour if receiving it and trying it on, I already asked for a return label.",0
5,I loved that the band is adjustable and you can make it as snug as you like.  It also looks great with or without a bracelet and it can be dressed up or down. It's a really pretty piece.,1
1,Handles were not long enough for me. Returned it.,0
4,Thin material.,1
1,Quality not good,0
2,Just as described but a little long,0
4,"Super cute, light weight jacket. Not very high quality and probably won’t last long but for the price, it’s worth it.",1
1,"These earrings are NOT GREEN.  They are very comfortable & the shape is just right, but I wanted green earrings.  These are a dark silver.",0
1,After having this watch for less than a month the bezel has fallen off and we have lost it.  It was being worn about 3 to 4 times a week and in very normal conditions.,0
3,The cover is a little soft when hook to your belt. It’s certainly smaller than the original pouch. The magnet is very strong so sticking to the buggy is not an issue.,0
3,Materials a little thin and too long,0
1,"I try to never order items that don’t have reviews, but I was desperate AND it was cute!! I am typically a 3x, or size 22 and this dress was wayyyyy too small!!! The material is also weird.",0
5,super duper cute and reached my thighs nicely (i'm 5'8),1
3,It's ok,0
3,WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THESE. KIND OF WHIMPY,0
2,Returned it. fit and style were awkward. Not flattering at all.Didn't like material or cut of sleeves.,0
2,It’s thing material and it fits but it’s extremely clingy,0
5,These umbrellas are awesome!,1
5,Beautifully elegant,1
5,I love these Jean's on my son perfect thanks,1
5,Size is smaller than what it says.  I have a nice scar on my left hand from the thing it cut me. And yet I can wear those small cheap gloves you see at most stores.,1
4,"ORDER UP!!!!! I am 5' 5'' and 130 pounds (muscular, athletic build I'd definitely still say I'm skinny lol) and usually I get a size small top and medium bottom (big booty judy over hur) and after reading the reviews I decided to order a LARGE because other people commented about it being too small. I am so happy I did, the suit looks amazing! the top is super adjustable so I think if you're usually a small or smaller medium in the chest the large top will fit well and the bottoms fit great (definitely cheeky but that's what I wanted). I only gave this suit 4 stars because I haven't worn it in the water yet and idk how functional it is but just off of appearance and fit this is 4 stars easily!!!! SO CHEAP TOO!!!",1
3,"I really wanted to like this dress, it’s cute, light and perfect for summer. I am 5’1 and 120 lbs and ordered a S. It fit just right everywhere except the length. Sadly, the length was a little too short for my liking. The color is more of a khaki than the bright green pictured in the images. Pretty and casual, will probably return for a medium",0
3,Nice hat too small sent back for exchange,0
3,"These watch bands fit well and have colors as advertised.  Unfortunately, they smell.  You have to leave the bag open for a long time to let them air before wearing them.  It doesn't go away quickly.",0
2,"Material not so stretchy, i pulled on one side and it ripped",0
1,The charm says HE instead of SHE.,0
5,Great everyday basic watch.,1
4,"I bought a size 5-6T for my 4 and 1/2 little girl.  She is a little bigger for her age, but not huge, yet It is still too small.  Other than that, it is nicely made.  I just wish there was a better way to check size.",1
3,"Look is great can fit HP EliteBook 8470p (fairly bulky laptop 15 inch), but very snug.  I can only fit my thin portfolio and the laptop into bag. Perfect for smaller laptops and tablets.  Can function as a purse.  Ideal for consolidation of electronics for carry-on on flight.",0
1,The button hole was closed up and we can’t even button the pants without cutting a hole ourselves. Pants were wayyyyy too small. Very disappointed.,0
1,"If you think you will receive a regular length cotton T-shirt, think again!! This is made out of some cheap silky polyester, not cotton. It is also a mid-length, boxy cut. Like a longer crop top. It is manufactured in and ships from China. If you don't like it and want a refund, you will have to fight for it!",0
5,Great buy for the price and so darn cute!,1
1,It faded its color,0
2,Ended up returning it before even trying it on.,0
4,"Nice shorts,",1
5,My friend loved it and uses it for work and looks great,1
4,I love it! It was a gift for my mother❤,1
1,"First, the material feels cheap. Second, the dress is VERY small to size. So small that it is stifling.<br /><br />Overall, I have nothing positive to say about this dress. I had high hopes for it however, I was sadly dissappointed.",0
3,this watch look good but has poor quality. the parts on the band fit poorly and not smooth to the touch. I wish it was made better but it is what it is.,0
5,This bracelet was actually really cute. I wasn't sure it would be but it was!! It is perfect for anyone that love My Little Pony!!,1
2,I had worn them and they cut my ears and my ears started bleeding because they pinch . Also my one starfish looks like the picture the other starfish was silver instead of the gold in the middle,0
3,"This was a very cute bathing suit and I loved it.  However, the bust was very small although the rest of the suit fit me perfectly.  Too bad.",0
5,Perfect alternative to a LL top I own. They're almost exactly the same!,1
4,We liked the fit and comfortabilty. Design is also nice. I don't like that they're fading and look worn out at the tip after worn 2 times only.,1
5,"I've bought quite a few packaged costumes over the years and they all felt really cheap and like they were going to rip apart as soon as I moved, but not this one. I used different glasses than what came with it, but I love it. So comfortable to spend the work day in. The pants were a little big, and the wig was a bit small, but other than that, its perfect.",1
2,The quality is not worth for the price that I paid ($27.99),0
5,Loving this top! Fits perfectly! I’m 4’11 and it falls just right a little below my hips. Can’t wait to show this off!,1
3,"Ok product, needed new batteries as soon as we opened it. But if you got a kid or adult addicted to Fortnite then this is a good buy. Pin pulls out and handle makes the Granade play sound and light up.",0
1,This is a flat strip of cloth with the mustash loops cut off the image. No nose wire and no seam for nose or chin.,0
3,The bottoms fit true to size. But the top is way too small. For references I'm a 34C and I was spilling out of the medium.,0
1,Too tight very small,0
1,The arms are way to long! And the shirt rise to much soft but uncomfortable,0
5,Big at first but after washing once they fit PERFECT!,1
2,Center birthstone fell out in just 2 months not wore all the time,0
2,This product is between 1/2 and 2/3 the thickness of the strap make by Yakima and nowhere near as durable.  It broke after the 2nd use.,0
5,"Came early, exactly as it looks in the picture!<br />The white part has a pearl essence to it and it shines!<br />Definitely a good buy for the price!",1
5,This dress is amazing. I love it. It’s made so very well and it fits so nice! Ladies that are bigger give this dress a try!!!! I’m sure it looks great in a lot of different shapes women!!!<br />I will say it is very heavy material!,1
1,"I got this in two sizes, the first time I thought I had maybe just ordered the wrong size or that they ran small but though the first size was apparently just right compared to other shoes owned and the second one large I could never get the shoe on to my child's foot.<br /><br />The material is too stiff for a toddler to get it on, it may work for an older child or an adult with some stiffness to be broken in but if the child will not let you get the very tight shoe on there is no breaking in that's going to be done.",0
5,"Have you ever covered up with one of those soft, gray, fuzzy sherpa like blankets?  If so, this is that blanket in a sweatshirt!  It's much warmer than I expected!  The fit is not at all flattering for my round shape, but I'll definitely wear it when venturing outside in these cold Ohio winters.  I think it may be a little too warm to wear around my house and I keep it on the chilly side.  I washed and dried this sweatshirt with my normal laundry and there were no issues with shrinkage or it coming apart.  It was just as soft after laundering as before.  It is a little bulky but would be great for layering clothes on a freezing cold day.",1
5,I had purchased a pr like this for $60+ elsewhere and of course lost one earring so I was thrilled to find these for $20+. These are just as beautiful as the others. I'm so pleased I may buy another pr as backup in case I lose one again.,1
1,"Awful!! Was a one piece mock wrap, polyester HEAVY material that stuck and cling to everything. Returned three seconds after opening and trying on. Don’t waste your time!!",0
3,I’m 5’7 and the pants were kinda of short the top wasn’t  tight enough fit really loose and the texture of the material was weird I didn’t like it at all and will be returning.,0
5,It was perfect.. loved the color.,1
5,I love nurse mate socks!  I have never been disappointed.  They fit great and are light.,1
5,It is lovely and exactly what I wanted. It looks better than a $10 necklace has any right too!,1
5,"Great socks, well made, soft and comfortable.",1
5,"I LOVE this dress and it is so comfortable! I've gotten endless amounts of compliments. It's lightweight, so great for the spring/summer. It has pockets (!!!!!!). The top is slightly see through, but I wore a cami underneath and it was perfectly fine. I'm 5'8, and wear a 8-10 in dress/pants and I bought this in a large. It falls right above my feet, so works great for my length. I want to buy one in every color!",1
5,These are well made & very comfortable,1
4,The prettiest little bracelet. Broke when I got it but I managed to reclasp it back together. Quality could be improved but still love it.,1
5,"This has become my new favorite dress. Simple, perfect fit, nice material, comfortable all day. I can't ask for more. I'm a size 16-18 with a large chest and I bought a 2x. I will be back for more colors.",1
5,Just what the Doctor ordered,1
5,Beautiful!!!,1
5,Love the fit and there is a little stretch to it.  Received a lot of compliments.  Will recommend ❤️,1
1,"Took this out of the package then put it in the wash and this all came off and is on everything it washed with , terrible",0
3,ORDER UP AT LEAST 2 SIZES!!!,0
4,One post came bent but not so much that the earring are unwearable. My daughter who has sensitive ears says they &#34;feel like rainbows&#34; in her ears. I would give the earrings five stars except for the bent post and the packaging was basic. The earrings came in a little bag in a box. If I was gifting them to someone I would need to repackage them.,1
1,"Initially these slippers were extremely comfortable, but after wearing them indoors for just over 2 months (purchased on October 26 2016) the sole has come loose from the tip of the toes to the ball of the foot. They just didn't last, I had high hopes for these and am quite disappointed with the durability of these slippers. Kind of a let down.",0
5,"A bit pricey for keychain but it’s definitely worth it. Very high quality leather. I love it, I’m sure it will hold good over time.",1
4,Really nice material and style but runs small would have gotten one larger size,1
3,It's perfect but heavy,0
1,"Way too small to be effective. but if you are looking for a chin strap, this might work",0
3,Shoe looks good. Fits good. Did not last a week. There’s a big hole in the top now. Material is awful.,0
5,"Perfect conditions, looks exactly like the picture",1
5,Cute...compliments figure.,1
1,I am a pear shape. the top is too big and hip area is too small. just kind of a weird fit all together. sending it back.,0
2,This item is rigid and doesn’t bend well to fit the ear.,0
5,"Stick scarf is very beautiful, very good decoration.",1
5,Gift for my first mother's day and I love it. Chain is short,1
3,I did wear it for two weeks without taking it out and the color it turn is like a copper but other than it was comfortable and pretty.,0
5,"I liked, little short but confortable!!!",1
1,"First, this came with a really long string that the customer was supposed to  lace up. The rise of the suit from waist to shoulder is absurdly short. I couldn't even get it on one arm. Material very thin and cheap. Looks great in pic, but quality is not good. Sent it back.",0
2,"falls on your face, too flimsy",0
3,"The material is absolutely lovely! It's well made; it's just too small!<br />My waist is a 42/44, I ordered a 46 and its tight around my waist. The arms are also super wide and long. I'm keeping it because I'm on a diet. I'm sure it will look wonderful after I tailor the sleeves and get my waist down to a 38/40.",0
5,nice. old school classic can be worn in a number of ways to achieve a desired look. the size chart is good for deciding what size is right for you. well made. folds up in my jacket pocket no problem when i am not wearing it,1
3,Not bad,0
4,none,1
2,"As a one size for all, the fit is too large for me.",0
5,Happy with my heart,1
3,"They are a tad thick for dressy laces.  I have learned to read for the word waxed.  The color is as pictured, but I could never find a brighter red.",0
4,Regular adult sizes are to big and don’t stay on.  These fit perfectly as a mask.  Would highly recommend for smaller frame adults.,1
1,"This is pathetic and illegal to take advantage of new tech to get few $ out of people.<br />PEARL IS FAKE ! THERE IS NOTHING NATURAL ABOUT IT! AND THE ONLY QUALITY U WILL GET, IS QUALITY OF PLASIC AND PAINT!",0
1,Worn 6 times and seams coming undone,0
5,Amazing pants. Perfect for riding my Harley. I purchased the hip pads as well and inserted them into the inner hip pockets. True to size. Jeans are soft and stretch a little.,1
1,Far too expensive for what the product is and it does not noticeably affect the fit of the hat.  Would not recommend this to any buyer.,0
1,My bracelet arrived with a broken clasp! Disappointing...can I exchange for one that has a working clasp?,0
3,is to big for me,0
3,Worked for a few months.  The zipper is broke due to stitching coming apart.  You have to re-engage the zipper now after opening fully.,0
1,"Too big, and the rubber stoppers do not hold anything in place. Waste of money.",0
5,Perfect,1
1,Very thin,0
1,Weird fit even after following chart.. It rides up a lot bcuz of the material. The shoulder were too big and just looked weird. Didn't send it back bcuz of the hassle. I will be cutting the sleeves and fixing what I can and just wear it to bed. Looks cute but just doesn't fit right.. waste of money for me,0
3,Felt cheap and id saying the color was off from the picture,0
5,[[VIDEOID:d4a43906097ff4d148bfcf00bba7feb8]] I'm 5’2 and 110 lbs ordered XS fit perfectly,1
5,Love this hat! I'm buying more colors. Really thick and comfortable.,1
5,These are gorgeous!,1
2,The fabric isn’t breathable so I’m sure it’ll be hot. Also this definitely runs small so order 1-2 sizes up. Cute shirt otherwise.,0
3,"The fleece didn’t fit inside the raincoat comfortably. It seemed like the two jackets weren’t made to go together. Separately, they fit fine. Color is nice.",0
5,I absolutely love this purse.Perfect size not too big not too small.I really like the style and the color combo.Good quality for the price.There are zip pockets on each end and one inside the bag.I highly recommend it.,1
4,Fits great!,1
4,"Runs 2 sizes small. Comfortable, soft, and great for informal events.",1
3,"Like the belt. Won't ever use for bottle opener.  I am 36&#34; and I would buy bigger, then cut down. Felt like too small",0
1,This bag broke without two weeks of use I need back my money or a next bag.,0
4,Cute bag tons of compliments only down fall it came with a big scratch on the front and I had to tighten one of the clamps on the chain since it kept coming apart,1
5,Excelent,1
5,These compression socks are very comfortable; best I ever had.,1
1,I don’t know what’s happening with MSBasic line but their dresses were almost always top notch quality for the price. Lately they have been making dresses out of extremely thin cheap fabric and charging double. I’m disappointed because even though I washed threes of their new dresses in cold water as indicated they shrank so bad they could even cover my bottom!! That’s right I accidentally flashed the entire restaurant after breakfast. Go back to the old heavy fabrics!,0
1,"I am constantly searching for really long, plus size tank tops. I thought that I hit the jackpot when I ordered this, but was very disappointed to find that it is made from some kind of scratchy artificial fiber. I was expecting cotton, or a stretchy cotton blend. It didn’t feel good on. I would return it, but I already threw away the packaging, and wore it.",0
1,"This ring is not sterling silver,  turned my finger green from the cheap metal",0
5,"I was expecting the color to be more of a wine, deep purple color, but it turned out to be more of a burgundy, blood red. But I absolutely still love the shirt. I get a lot of compliments and it fits me comforters where I can move about, but still look flattering on me. I definitely would recommend this to anyone",1
1,"This shirt runs too small, like really small! The material was not comfortable!",0
5,Great gloves! They are soft and warm. I bought another pair in brown.,1
1,Wore it one time and the bottom bottom tore the skirt as I was getting out of the car. Then during dinner same night I went to adjust the skirt and it rip down the side of my leg. Very poor quality material and tears very easily.,0
3,"The pendant is pretty but the chain is flimsy. I popped it opening the packaging.<br /> Also, it took a very, very, long time to receive it.",0
5,"It fits with my watch, did its purpose",1
2,Fits okay; just not really good enough for work,0
3,Does the job. Not as high quality as I thought,0
1,Hard to evaluate a product that was DOA out of the box.,0
5,It was so cute and fit so well! I can wear it out for other things and not just for Halloween!,1
5,Very cure and love the borders especially,1
5,good product at a good price,1
3,These are very nice. Smaller than I thought but my fault for not reading size!  Nice sterling silver.  I had to open them up to even begin to go through my earlobes.,0
5,"These shorts are super soft and comfortable. They're very flattering if you have a shapely booty. I bought several pairs in different colors. Def size up, because they're not in American sizes.",1
1,This hat has a giant front panel that will make anyone look ridiculous.,0
2,"Too small, I had to give to my 10 years old nephew",0
2,There where nit clear. I needed them to be clear  or see threw.,0
1,"Ordered size 7 1/2, got something else.",0
1,"Did not work after a month and it stopped working a few days after the 30 day return.<br />Please look elsewhere, not happy St all",0
4,Very nice thick zip up hoodie.<br />Graphic detail outstanding.<br />This company's sizing is usually 1 to 2 sizes smaller than average so take that into consideration when purchasing.,1
3,Didn't look good on me by I have a tummy pouch and its very form fitting. If I had a flatter tummy it would be more flattering. Top was a little big for my 42D boobs. I purchased an XXL and unfortunately will be returning it.,0
5,These are pretty cute and thin just like the picture. I like these a lot. I would order these again.,1
5,Very nice umbrella. Color is just what it looked like. I have used it several times already. Very happy with this product so far. Thinking of ordering one for a gift.,1
3,"It's a lovely rayon material, a nice mid-length, and cute. A few issues, it is fairly sheer (got the pink, maybe not an issue in darker colors?) so you definitely have to wear a slip.  The pink is closer to peach, but not a bad color, still pretty. But the reason I am returning is it is more low cut than I wanted - the top of the dress is right about flush with top of my bra - it's sort of loose, so if I bend over to pick something up, well no one wants to see that on a 60 year old lady!",0
3,Was a gif t,0
4,"I absolutely love how thick the material is on this dress! The pockets are also a great feature. My only problem was that the L size that I bought  (I'm 5'5 and a size 14-16 in jeans, L-XL for tops) was reallllly long. I didn't mind it at first, however, I kept tripping on it and then it would pull on the straps and seemed to stretch out. I washed and dried this dress and it didn't shrink at all. Overall, it is a great beach and pool dress!",1
1,Not worth the embarrassment of putting it on and having it fall apart right away.  I would not recommend the product,0
5,Good value,1
4,"Came on time. Lightweighe sweater dress. Thin but not too thin. I'm 5'2"" bubble battle and 36B chest. About 145lbs. I ordered the small. It fits good. Not clingy, but not super baggy. I like mine a little loose. Downside attracts alot of lint, but nice otherwise.",1
5,love it,1
1,Bought the matching shirt and neither fit my 80 pound Shepherd. Nice material. Poor design.,0
1,"Top is way to small. I ordered XL. The top is barely a medium at best. It was made well, but the sizing is way off. Almost teen size. Too bad..",0
3,Very pretty necklace!<br />Pros:<br />Reasonably priced<br />Seems to be decent quality<br />Not cheap looking at all<br />Cons:<br />Incredibly difficult to clasp (I almost never have a problem with this)<br />Somewhat dainty/fragile<br />Clasp constantly ends up in the front by the charm due to the extension not being weighted enough.<br />Overall: Would purchase again. Going to add some weight to the extension myself to keep it from turning constantly (can be bought at a craft store),0
4,I thought these were solid material throughout but they have an adjustable section. I like.,1
5,EXCELLENT,1
5,Comfortable good looking and easy on and off. These even wear great in the garden.,1
5,"I'm going to be honest, this purse looks EXPENSIVE. The purse looks so expensive, I would expect to see the Coach logo on the inside if I hadn't bought it myself.  It feels like real leather. If you're looking for a pretty big purse, this is a good one!",1
1,This product was not even close to the sizing indicated. A great big disapointment:(,0
4,A couple of them snag on clothing. However they do not make my belly button itch or get a rash like some do (the ones from Spencer’s sometimes)... & they have not broke even though I wear the dangly ones 24/7. No color turning yet. Worn each dangly one atleast a week.,1
3,"This isn't a bad bra, but be warned, the edges curl up slightly upon just the first wear. So I can only imagine that will get worse over time. Also, it's not shown clearly, but this bra doesn't just feature a mesh detail in the center, the whole bra has mesh covering it. Also, the center doesn't press firmly to my sternum, and I doubt it would no matter what size I ordered, as the wire just doesn't feel sturdy enough to stand up to big boobs.<br /><br />The good? It fits and is comfortable. It'll be a good comfy bra, but it doesn't look how I expected, nor does it feel like $57 worth of bra. I've gotten sturdier feeling bras with better material and details for cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad bra, I won't be returning it, but I won't be purchasing again either.",0
2,"I should have returned these but unfortunately tried a walk in them. The half heel is pretty bad, and found the best way to make it work was to tuck it under the insole so it effectively became a slide. It does fold the sides which can be felt when walking.",0
2,Jacket was not heavy or warm like it was advertised and size were small.,0
5,"Love these. Very soft lining, nice tailored fingers instead of the clunky boxy kind, nice leather. Will be perfect for my trip north coming up soon.",1
5,Great quality.  Living in Cali and needed a new alma mater hat.  Hard to come by out here. Go heels!,1
2,The packaging and the presentation were great. The gloves look good; they allow you enter information without having to remove them; but they do not offer enough protection against the cold.<br />They should make the gloves with a heavier material.,0
5,Stylish and well made. It's great you can upgrade the Fitbit into a business watch just like that . Easy and smart,1
5,Everything Wendy cert Wellington and fast,1
2,it has no support for your chest and bottoms are way too small,0
3,"If you're heavy, overweight as I am, 2X this is just not going to look good on you the cut is weird instead of gradually going towards the back it literally cuts and goes down the front of your leg. It probably looks great on a thin person but it's just not created for those who are plus size",0
5,"The size was good, and it has great color.  Looked wonderful on our front door for thanksgiving",1
1,Terrible material,0
2,"Cute idea but cheaply executed. Love the idea of the socks but unfortunately they are short of mediocre. They are low quality and could ha a been purchased at a dollar store.  They are t bbn in and not at all soft and very lackluster in person.  The sign is kind of a joke, its size of small lisence plate and I'm not sure where you are supposed to put it.  No way worth $15!!!!! I wouldnt pay more than $5 for the socks. Dont waist your money...just buy the person a book!",0
1,Item arrived dirty and not functioning as described. Within minutes of opening the package it fell apart.,0
1,Clip broke off the first time I used it.,0
5,"very cool looking,",1
5,I like how white it was and the material is 👍🏾 great,1
1,Definitely not worth $20.,0
4,It was great until I decided I was a hair stylist and cut it. It was a botch job. Wish they had a nice short white wig. Cause there was no fixing that.,1
3,The slippers are super cute but they are really really hard. It's like walking on light bricks covered in foam. Hahaha idk how else to explain it. They dont hurt but they are not comfortable either. They also shed quite a bit....but I mean...there cute 🤷🏽‍♀️,0
5,Great sunglasses. They're cute and they're polarized.,1
4,Holds my pants up well.,1
1,Very poor quality.  They cut part of the name off and then just sewed it together.  Will be returning.,0
1,"Basically I received 2 right shoes. Check the picture.  The actual right show seemed ok, a little tight, but otherwise good. The left looks like a right and the sizing was way off.",0
1,Order two sizes bigger. Mine didn't fit at all.,0
1,"When I opened these upon delivery, I was in love! They looked great. I was extremely gentle with them, and not a week later, after only wearing them three times, one of the extensions just came off in my hand with provocation. There are a lot of similarly priced sunglasses on Amazon, and many are better quality, I'd recommend a different pair.",0
1,Bought in January and rope has come unglued and unraveled,0
5,"I bought this dress for my prom. The material is soft and catches the light beautifully, it's also breathable and I can move easily in the dress. I also have a wider body as well, so I was pleasantly surprised when it slimmed me down so well. Photos don't do it justice!",1
5,This was a gift for my sister  and it was a very nice set !!!,1
1,Junk! Circle piece does not stay flat. Broke right away!,0
1,Terrible thin scratchy material; not terrycloth as one would expect for an after-shower wrap.<br />Immediately returned.,0
5,Nice quality hat!,1
5,It fits well,1
5,"Super cute, bought for my niece and she loved it!",1
1,The material is low quality and looks nothing like the picture,0
4,"The bag has really great features but I thought it was a little big/bulky.  And while the single strap to backpack conversion is pretty cool, i thought that there could be more padding in the strap cushion.",1
2,Didn't like,0
1,The material is cheap and too stretchy,0
3,"These masks are HUGE! And they’re not the colors described. They’re much lighter in color than shown, ex navy blue is actually a true blue. They remind me of really cheap pillowcase material. I ended up giving them to someone at work, a 6’3 man, who still says they’re big for his “large face”. Just spend a few extra bucks and get something better.",0
1,Broke so easily,0
5,Great Cardigan!  Will buy more if I can find the colors I need.<br />Excellent Service!,1
1,The dress is not like pictured on the model. The neckline is like a tshirt maybe a tad wider. The sizing is also small by a size or two.,0
3,"They will shrink, so I would recommend ordering a size larger.",0
1,"This states it is a full finger enclosed glove, it is false! It was missing the thumb and 2 fingers! Poor customer service. It was bought before my daughters birthday and I wrapped it, never knowing it was missing protection! Too late for returning & no exchanges. Do not buy!",0
5,"Is very pretty,very delicate and elegant.",1
4,The fact that they are reversible is a double edge sword. On one hand they are bulky on the other the nylon is less sweaty with a cotton side.,1
3,looks cheap on and not the best shape in the back,0
5,I love it ... just had to loosen the band a bit so it can fit perfectly.,1
3,"cute, good quality",0
2,"Pretty but GINORMOUS.  If it were half or a quarter of the size it might be wearable, but at this size, no way.  Not for me.",0
5,"Keeps all the thingies in one place, neatly. Wife is happy. Kids are fed. Whatever else to wish?",1
2,The scarf is not satin like its stated. The scarf is 100% polyester.,0
4,"I really love this jacket.  I get tons of compliments.  I purchased it in purple.  Please note  It is actually a more vibrant,  more fuschia purple than the photo shows.  It is on the small side as other reviewers mentioned.-  bought it with the expectation it would still be a fitted jacket when I slim down a bit.  I would be more comfortable in an XL,  but the L fits.  I think if the lining had any stretch to it,  the leather would  conform to shape-  & it would perfect now.  The sleeves are long,  and would be too long in an XL.  The leather appears to be of good quality-  It's not the utmost grade one could possibly purchase, hence 4 and not 5 stars,  but it definitely doesn't look cheap.  I'm glad I took the leap and purchased this!",1
5,"Solid wristwatch which does precisely what it describes. Keeps time, has a few handy but quite standard features, and is affordable.",1
4,Great looking outfit and fantastic price!,1
3,Cap is warm but difficult to turn the lights on and wiring looks very fragile.  I do not expect a long life.,0
5,My grandson loves the shirts. They are very stylish on a 9 year olds.,1
3,"Loved the picture, but when you get it, get out the magnifying glass.  what looked like green on the elephant is not visible to the naked eye.  I never thought anyone could make charms this teeny weeny.",0
3,This is a pretty purse and works okay for a night out.  It is very stiff and hard to fit stuff into it well.,0
2,"Not what I expected but maybe I didn't read the description closely. The overall quality was ok. I was hoping for a nicer product. I ended up returning the hat as it was going to be a gift but when I saw it, I couldn't give it as a gift.",0
1,Terrible fitting shirt.  Shoulder seams hang halfway down the biceps.  Body of shirt is huge - would wrap one and a half times around my body.  Neck is way to tight - impossible to button. I ordered a size large which is my normal size.  This is the only time i have gotten a size large shirt that didn't fit.,0
4,"Beautiful bag that looks exactly as pictured. I like the size and the vintage style. My only issue was the strap broke at the link the third day I had it, but I just super glued it and its been fine ever sense. I would still recommend this purse. I get a lot of compliments!",1
5,They are comfortable and stylish. I would recommend it. Will definitely purchase one again!,1
1,I ordered this plus size dress because I was going on a cruise. I did not like it at all. The lace sleeves were tight and I look like a balloon in it! I am sending it back.,0
5,Works great,1
1,just opened it and it came missing a spike- had to return immediately,0
5,Cute shoes,1
5,For like a glove,1
5,Wife loves it. It looks incredible.,1
3,Suit appears to be good quality but very small busted. I bought an XL based on size chart. Bra cups were approximately size B.,0
5,"I would have lost my mind, if I didn't purchase these cufflinks.",1
1,Cheaply made shows.  Velcro strap does not stay closed.  Very disappointed,0
5,"My grail watch is the Grand Seiko this pays homage to. I’m just happy someone finally recreated the GS. I’ve seen better quality homages in this price range and it’s a 3-4 star in that regard, but it’s the one and only homage of its kind so it’s getting 5 stars just on principle.",1
2,"Had I received both hair clips, I probably would have left five stars. However, only one arrived in the package sent to me. The one that I'd gotten was the white one; it's adorable, surprisingly incredibly soft, and well made.",0
3,"Used to replace of old broken doc martin laces. These are not as nice, they are &#34;shinny&#34; almost and don't stay tied very well. Would just pay the extra couple buck for the doc martin laces next time...",0
2,I ordered this dress but sent it back because it runs pretty large and is also VERY boxy. Not as form fitted in real life as it is in the picture.,0
1,Not was I thought they were. Did not work for me.,0
5,"A gift she will never forget, at least the year we were married.",1
5,More than perfect! Great value for it. Wore it to a German Birthday party. It was a huge hit!,1
2,Very small. I even measured my hands as suggested.,0
3,"These are workout headbands, not something I am going to wear outside when I visit Wisconsin<br />in December. These are fine, good price but not my favorite head bands.",0
1,Really small and poorly made.,0
5,Very impressed with the product quality. My wife loved these.,1
5,LOVE THE COLORS,1
1,"I am not new to septum jewelry so this isn’t on me. I put one of these in last night but accidentally put it in backwards. I’ve been trying and trying to take it out, which again, I’m used to doing. It will not come out no matter how hard I try. I’m actually going to a piercing studio to see if they can remove it or if I have to cut it out. This was supposed to be a fun thing and not a nightmare. I won’t be buying any more nose rings online.",0
1,See through material.  Very thin & cheap quality. Do not recommend. Shorter than expected as well.,0
1,This bracelet lasted 3 days. Definitely not worth the money.,0
3,Beautiful but too small. Wish it came bigger,0
4,"Very comfortable fits perfectly ,however the pants legs are a little long",1
1,Not true to size AT ALL.,0
3,"The dress has a fun pattern, but unfortunately for a tall girl (5'9&#34;) it works better as a blouse!",0
1,Super cheap ties. No material inside the tie to give it structure. Wouldn't recommend. Not for everyday use.,0
1,"Do not buy these hats! Poor quality, poor construction. They  came so crunched in a small bag. The vinyl on the bill of the cap wasnt glued well, the insignias were off center. They did not have a discernible shape like regular captain's hat is supposed to.",0
5,I liked this watch very much. It's perfect and exactly what i wanted.,1
5,"I purchased one, and then came back to get two more and recommended them to my Mom. These masks are comfortable, I can wear them without fogging up my glasses HUGE PLUS!! And copper is naturally anti bacterial and anti microbial - also big plus. Super easy to wash and they air dry quick.",1
5,They were as expected.,1
2,barely got through a week before fraying ):,0
5,I like this very much.,1
5,Well made and the fabric is thick.,1
1,The watch was very stylish and the two-tone was great for matching everything. However the clasp was horrible. Wore it three times with it falling off several times. The last time I wore it it fell off sometime during the night and was lost. Money down the drain!,0
5,Fabric is thick but soft. Very warm.<br />I ordered these for my dad. He liked them so much he ended up ordering two more!,1
3,"This dress would have been perfect if it had fit.  Really lovely.  Well made.  I ordered XXL  I wear an 18 and it was a size 6, maybe an 8 on a good day.  All the girls at work loved it and it would not have fit anyone here.  Make the sizes true and I'll order it again!",0
3,"It's pretty big but with enough strength you can bend it in a little.  And it looks a little cheap, but not really",0
5,Very cute and well made perfect for a doggy lover &#60;3,1
5,Great if you have a light vascular disease the support is light burn effective,1
1,I'm very disappointed in this order. The pants is poorly made and extremely short in length. The material is also very see-through and cheap,0
5,I'm 5'3 not thin nor obese and this fit perfectly. I like how the material is thick and the style is simple but cute.,1
3,"We went camping and used these to keep the dirt / sand away. It's a tight fit, prefer looser types.",0
5,Its true to size and good fabric.<br />Feels good to work out in.<br />I dont know how they hold up after a couple of washes though,1
4,"Sent on time, good size.",1
5,"I love it, bought one for a friend.  The red is a cross between red and a rose color. Perfect for going out and not having to carry a big purse. Don't hesitate to buy one, it's perfect",1
2,"Thin fabric and cute, but the main problem is that the cat transfers on the knees peel and rip. This happened on the first day my daughter wore them!  You can peel them off and I will most likely do this, but it is a bummer because the cats are what my daughter liked.  Also, you can see light through the fabric when you hold it up to a light source, so it is on the thin side; These pants are more like leggings, definitely not pants for winter months.",0
2,"The watch was dead when I received it, and I've continued to receive automated emails thanking me for my purchase, though I've already been refunded for it.",0
1,"Top looks completely different from what is pictured, doesn't even look like the same material that is in the picture, It also runs big",0
1,"Review Update June 17, 2021<br />After two days of wearing my favorite ball cap and this sweat liner I've stopped using them.<br />After about an hour wearing the hat with this sweat liner my head sweats everywhere the liner touches my skin. I don't normally sweat much. The absorbency does not seem to work.<br /><br />Initial Review June 14, 2021<br /><br />I don't know if something like this already existed or this is a first but it makes sense. I wear a ball cap when outdoors most of the time. Of course the headband gets soiled by my sweat and any dust and dirt in the air. Having a tear off disposable sweat liner seems like a good idea.<br /><br />When I first opened the package these sweat liners looked too large but they fit fine. They also don't seem to have a surface sticky enough to stay in place. I put one on my had and wore it for an hour. What I noticed after an hour is:<br /><br />1) It stayed stuck in place and didn't shift or slip.<br /><br />2) It seems to have actually made me sweat more than not using one. It is supposed to be absorbent  but my forehead was damp when I took my hat off after an hour.<br /><br />The price seems reasonable for a 40 count.<br /><br />I will continue to use these and will return here with a follow up review update.",0
5,Breathable material. Simple yet sexy. I love this dress,1
1,"The buckle on this belt, cut my hand as the &#34;machining&#34; on it is like sheet metal and razor sharp. I do not recommend.",0
5,"Nice feel and fit. Looks good with a little jacket, too.",1
4,Last set I ordered were too short. These are just right and hold very well. Interesting stretch pattern material. All OK.,1
2,I’m 5’3 115lbs ordered small way too big,0
1,"Terrible quality, arrived frayed at the bottom and on the sleeves. Usually wear a size small, ordered a medium but it was more like an XL",0
4,I read the reviews and they really did fit as expected. These are holding up as well as expensive name brand sandals and they are comfy for my son who has sensitive feet.,1
2,cheap and the color was awful!!! wasted 14.99,0
1,The sleeves were way too long and way to big around. Too bad. I love the fabric and would have purchased multiples.,0
1,The worse dress I have ever bought. CHEAP!!,0
3,"Love the fit, pretty.  But, the green color is extremely pale. Almost white. Not what I saw in photo.",0
3,"I purchased these sandals for my 6 year-old granddaughter because she loved the gladiator style of them. The fit runs true to size, but the back of the heel has almost been designed to be too high, hitting her at an awkward place on her ankle and rubbing blisters on the poor kiddo’s skin. Unfortunately, cute isn’t enough to make up for the ouchie factor.",0
5,These are seriously the best earrings ever!,1
5,Very soft,1
1,It literally looks nothing like the picture. Definitely not worth 11$ for something that looks so cheap in reality.,0
1,"Stick too big, can't push it through.",0
3,Hoped for better material,0
3,"Cute graphic, color just as pictured, very soft (but quite thin). I think it’s sized larger. I paid attention to other reviewer’s who said to definitely size up and I regret that decision. It is made to be oversized so order your regular size; do not order a size up.",0
3,I like it but it was much too tight. I just ordered another in a large and hoping it will fit. I normally wear a medium. Saw another review where the top was larger than expected. Hope the company is watching the sizing.,0
1,At least 50% of the attempts did not work. Very over priced for its utility,0
5,Love this watch!,1
2,Didn't really stay in position as you'd expect.  Good in theory though.,0
2,Its alot smaller than shown. And the sides dont really fit well.,0
3,"This is cute, but reminds me of a wrestling singlet.  Also, difficult to change my daughter once she's in it since it doesn't have snaps at the bottom.",0
4,"Pero debo tener cuidado al lavarlo, pues el dibujo parece caerse con facilidad",1
5,"LOVE, I am usually between a 7-7.5 I went with 7 and there is PLENTY of room. I hate my boots tight so these are perfect for me! They fit more like a 7.5 on the larger side. The shoes are bulky but that’s the look I was going for, the sole makes them very comfortable. They came so quick also! I have skinny ankles so it’s hard to find boots to fit and these are very fitted.",1
5,Look no further.  Winners Bank 200 is all you'll need.,1
4,"Got these for me, but were slightly too big. I wear size 5.5 to 6 womens shoes. Gave to my husband who wears 10.5 in mens shoes. He loved them.",1
5,Work well,1
5,Very well constructed. Fun and colorful love it,1
5,Wife said she loved it,1
5,Dainty and cute. Gifted it to my daughter who loves space stuff. She loved it.,1
5,This dress fits is amazing I love this. I was so happy to finally purchase it. It feels great too.One purchase I am proud of 😊,1
5,My daughter loves them!!!!,1
2,"This coat was too large when I received it, and the style and material was not quite what I expected. I returned the coat.",0
5,"I suffer from migraines and high blood pressure. I have been wearing the bracelets for 6 months, I have noticed a big difference.  I highly recommend",1
4,Could have been super cute! But it smelled weird and it ran a little small of you have a bigger chest ended up returning,1
2,"The item seem cheap in person, didn’t like how the outfit fitted, it seem too big. Ordered a large.",0
3,Links pulled apart if they are pulled too tight served it purpose for after surgery when I couldn't put my arm through my sleeve,0
3,It is over priced,0
5,They really are the best. Great support. Easy to put on. Thin enough you don't die of heat in the summer. Highly reccommed them.,1
1,Returned-the once received it looked like something a nurse would wear at work.,0
5,This item was just perfect.  It really made a nice charm to start my bracelet.  I would buy from them again.  Fast Delivery too!,1
5,Great product super comfortable. I’m a breastfeeding momma and this dress helped ease it! Pockets are a plus.,1
3,Too dark.  They look black once worn.  I was hoping they would be brighter.,0
5,My bridesmaid looks amazing in this beautiful dress. Can’t wait for my wedding. I wouldn’t change a thing love it. Saw the same kind of dress in Macys for way too much money and the fabric wasn’t even as beautiful as this dress.,1
3,"Nice for the price, i wouldnt recommended them for anyone that even has a slightly wide head tho. My head isnt even that big(wear size 7 1/4 helmet/medium motorcycle helmet) and they squeeze my head and give me a headache. I wish they had more give to them so they wouldnt squeeze so tight. Cute style tho",0
3,Overall quality of the product isn't bad.  It's thinner than my expectation but my daughters love it.<br /><br /> But I got one big problem.<br />I ordered two different sizes : 10-11 yrs and 12-13 yrs.  The seller sent me 8-9 yrs in a clear bag with 10-11 sticker label.  The other size arrived correctly.  I requested to replace the wrong one to the correct size(10-11) and got it yesterday.  The same thing happened.  It was 8-9 yrs bath robe with 10-11 sticker label outside.  I gave up replacing it.  My daughter can't wait any longer and I doubt that I'll ever get the correct one.  Be aware of this if you're ordering 10-11 size cat bathrobe.,0
2,Disappointed I tried on the same pair at the good feet store and they fit. But when I got these they are too big.,0
5,"I was hesitant due to some of the reviews, so I got the insurance as well. I guess we’ll see if I need it. Anyways, I’m one of those that goes into a coma when they go to bed. I am horrible at waking up on time. I set this at 50%, and headed off to bed. Let me tell you... I was up within 30 secs. The vibrate didn’t wake me, the beep didn’t wake me... but as soon as it zapped. I was up instantly. So far, I’m very impressed!",1
2,"These earrings are very dainty. I work in the lunchroom cafeteria and we can't wear large earrings, but  for me these are a bit too small.",0
1,"I originally bought these to go with a navy blue and gold salwar kameez to wear to an Indian wedding reception. When the earrings arrived, they were true to the picture. The stones were deep blue. However, they were very heavy. Also, the wires in the back (to go into your earlobe hole) were very thick. I couldn't even put the earrings on because the wires were too big in diameter to fit my earlobe hole! I had to return them because I couldn't wear them.",0
3,"I was disappointed with this item, I don’ t know how fast they are produced but my ring fell of and the lobster clasp broke after the 4th time i wore it.",0
5,My husband wanted big slippers for Christmas like his uncle had. His uncle has the homer slippers and its seems like everyone does and I wanted to get him something different. My husband says they are really really warm even with the polar vortex hitting this year. They make everyone who comes over giggle at the sight.,1
3,Fits large heads. To big for ladies and kids,0
2,"Top is way too big, bottoms are way too small. All wrong.",0
5,"It’s a little loose for a size small but it isn’t too bad, I think it’s made to be tucked in so overall I like it!",1
5,Quality material and fits perfect!,1
1,"Liked the belt a lot while it lasted, but unfortunately the ratchet pin repeatedly falls out and now I've finally completely lost it making the belt unusable after only a few months of use.",0
1,Not again.,0
3,"I liked the look and design but extra large must be a large, once I put it on I need help getting it off.",0
3,"This bathing suit is well made, however, the sizing runs small. I ordered a medium because it says true to size and that's what all my other suits are. I am returning the medium and getting a large because it is a nice swimsuit and I love the support it seems to have up top, unlike others in this price range.",0
1,These earrings made my ears all red and swollen after wearing for a few hours.,0
1,Doesn't hold.  Provides no support,0
5,My mom loved this. She displays it on her dresser. It's still beautiful and I bought this a weak before mother's day 2021,1
3,Not for a 5’ 2 mom! Runs big!,0
5,"The patten is very cute and the design is very elegant. Beautiful African print and bold color.<br />I use the belt as headband instead.  Also, I added a dark blue jacket to cover my arms.<br /><br />Fit as expected !",1
5,Me en encanta,1
5,Great pin ... well made using it for my Id tag.....I have bought from this company years prior.,1
4,I bought it for a wedding. Usually wear a 2x but got a 1x because it stretch. And it fits perfectly!,1
5,"Size Large in this fits perfect. For reference I am 5'5&quot;, 150 lbs., and curvy. I usually wear a U.S.A. size medium. From the reviews, the size chart measurements (very accurate) and because this is a bodycon fit, I ordered up a size. Fits me perfect. Dress delivered is better than pictured! 90% cotton and 10% spandex. Dress is lightweight but NOT see through. You can see and feel the quality. The pictures on Meaneor's product pages are accurate and very helpful! Shipped fast also.",1
3,am returning it as it was mis-labled,0
5,Great!!!!!,1
1,I did not like the because the gloves were all different sizes. One was to tight the next was falling off. They also tear very easily. Not worth the money,0
3,Tried to put one in my cartilage and it was to small for the ball to go on. I’m hoping my girls will be able to wear them in their ears.,0
5,"Nice,will order more in different colors.",1
3,Got an XL it was still to small!,0
5,"Used to clean out very disgusting living space. Worked effectively, though a few did tear.",1
1,Wore 2xs and one of the buckets broke off and a shoe string broke,0
3,"The goggles themselves are great. They function as goggles should, keeping the water out of my eyes. As for reviews claiming they don't fit, a simple adjustment of the tightness or placement of the strap on the head is all that's needed.<br /><br />The three stars is because of the incessant plea for reviews from the seller via email. I just want a pair of goggles and did not want to sign up for email spam. One email is request is fine, but stop there. The option to unsubscribe doesn't excuse the spam. Again, I wanted goggles, not the inconvenience of having to unsubscribe from emails.",0
2,"I loved the way the keychain looked. It also came quickly. However, the paddle broke in two the first time I dropped my keys. I didn't even realize it broke until I got to work. Not sure if I'll buy again.",0
1,"Not only was I’d see through and very cheap material, I was sad bc it didn’t give much stretch as far as the elastic goes.",0
4,I love this jacket its so cute I gave a 4 instead of a five because of the size its a little tight but the sleeve are long and overall it looks nice on me,1
2,They’re pretty but you can tell that it’s just cut up wires painted,0
4,Dog tag is. Great. But chain is flimsy,1
5,Super comfy and fits great just sheer and not squat proof. Great for a hike since it’s super lightweight and feels buttery smooth.,1
1,"This coat is cheaply made and feels like plastic! The sleeves are way too short, like a child's coat. It reminds me of a trash bag, and actually my 9 year old son thought it was.",0
5,I love the shirts.,1
5,This is a beautiful necklace and it fits me well.The necklace looks just like the picture.:),1
5,"Great suit. Elastic on the bra band could be better, it’s a bit tight so it’s a tad difficult to put on.",1
2,This product is NOT one size fits all. Too big for my face.,0
5,"Good cap, I left it in a cafe.",1
5,"Love the comfort of these yoga pants. The fact that I can fit my phone in one of the two pockets when on the go, is great. Leaves my hands free to shop, eat, or drive, because sad to say I'm not doing yoga in them!",1
2,"Mask was smaller than I hoped, more child sized than for adult. Facial expression can only be seen if I can figure out how to prevent fogging and smashing my face. Wore for 5 minutes and the area of face it covered began sweating.  Looks as if it was hurriedly put together, I am OCD and the pleats/folds were not lined up evenly... in other words, it is crooked... It is slightly thicker plastic than a page protector, but not as thick as shower curtain plastic. I paid more for this mask than several others, and waited longer to get this mask than any other I ordered. If I could sew, I could have bought a clear $5.00 shower curtain and made my own... but, I don't sew.",0
5,What else needs to be said?,1
5,These are the best underwear I have ever worn. I’m now going to order a second set. They kind a tuck you in and are very comfortable.And they come in beautiful colors as well.,1
2,It is very dull. I even used jewelry cleaner and it remained gray. I'm not certain its sterling . Not happy:(,0
1,Cheap material doesn’t look good,0
5,Material is good quality.  Fit perfectly for my uncle that I ordered them for.  Loves them quite a lot.,1
2,They didn’t fit at all. I am 5’ 160lbs .<br />They were way too big.,0
5,Fit as expected,1
5,Just what I expected great my daughter loves it,1
5,"I am frequently changing between my reading glasses and sunglasses when going in and out of stores. unfortunately I tend to lay down my sunglasses and lose them. This keeps me from losing my sunglasses . They strap is light weight and not a distraction. I like the feel, color and It was very easy to put on. Thanks",1
4,Great weekend dress. Runs a bit small in the bust area,1
4,cute,1
5,Very nice for a holiday,1
3,It's roomy and the letters are too far right.  I keep having to adjust them to be in the center of my chest.  But it's comfortable and a cute design.,0
1,They are warm but they are on the small side and the two do not match. The stitching is off and one shoe is bigger then the other.,0
1,Cheap material. Very Thin. Disappointing,0
5,This belt is a great fit and quality.  It is not real leather but it doesn't look cheap. I wish the metal was a silver color instead of gold. I can live with it though.,1
5,Little large,1
5,"Love, better than expected.",1
5,Fits perfect! Warm nice material! Will definitely be buying more of these in different colors!,1
5,Really hard to find tapers this large in my area. My small has 3 different store with piercing stuff and don't carry tapers this size . so happy to finally upsize worked great,1
3,This exact watch is at Wal-mart for $15 suckers!! The two outter buttons dont do anything. But i really only like the way it looks.,0
5,Liked the item.,1
3,"Love the way ot fits, just wish the color in the picture matched what I got.  I got the taupe color but even though the label on my dress said taupe, the dress was a much lighter color than the pic.",0
3,The dress was decent quality.  It was shorter than expected and the buttons did not feel secure. Nice color great material,0
5,"Beautiful stone, beautifully carved, solid",1
5,Love it.,1
2,Inferior quality. Very disappointing.,0
5,We bought this pillbox hat for my mom to wear in church.  The hat  is gorgeous and so is my mom wearing it.<br />She looks like the Queen of England when she wears a suit and this hat!  It is more than worth the price.,1
5,"These goggles are by far a great purchase. Great fit, which can be adjusted easily with the strap. I was playing with it earlier to give test them out and they will fit nice and tight as they should be around the nose area to avoid any air or snow from coming in.<br /><br />Critique: My only critique is the packaging. They send it in a bag that makes it easier for you to transport them and its really soft so you dont have to worry about them getting scratched, however I would have wished that they would have came in a holder or at least a cardboard box to keep them in place because now when I transporr them I’m afraid they’ll break!<br /><br />However they’re overall a great buy!",1
5,"This is a good size for me when I travel.  The fact that it has removable straps, to possibly use as a wallet in a larger purse or tote bag,  is a bonus for me.  It seems well made and the gray color I chose blends well with a wide assortment of colors.  All in all, a good deal for the price.",1
5,my niece who is turning 2 loves her shoes!!,1
5,I wasn't wearing my diamond earrings because the screw backs just gave out on me.  I ordered these and<br />they fit perfectly and do the job well!,1
1,It looks pretty at first but it isn't 92 sterling silver as described. I would return it if I didn't have to go to alot of trouble to do it. Would never buy from this seller again unless they make it right? I will let y'all know!,0
2,Nothing special.... I was just hoping they had more cushion,0
5,It's perfect! From the fit to the length.  It can be dressed up or down.  Nice for spring and summer too,1
1,"Be careful because fit, length and quality of fabric was very different in the two colors that I ordered in the same size and style from this manufacturer.<br /><br />The olive green that I'm returning is much longer and much wider and the fabric thin and flimsy, although supposedly made from the same fabric content, compared to the dark green I had ordered and loved.<br /><br />I love the style and the price this brand charges compared to the ones I've purchased from previously  but I am now reluctant to order a different color because of the inconsistencies.<br /><br />it's a pity because the dark green is perfect. I  have the same dress in different colors in the same fabric from other manufacturers that I bought on Amazon with no variation on sizing or fabric quality. I'll spend a few dollars more because the quality control is better.",0
1,I order three sizes too big just in case and the size that came in was still too small. Very disappointed,0
1,purchase pack of 2 as stated  but only received 1. Therefore I returned  iy.,0
4,Super cute. I bought them as a gift for my boyfriend. But they were too small for him. Now they are mine,1
5,Perfect fit for my 15.5lb 6 month old!  Headband a little big.,1
1,"No Warranty or way to contact manufacturer. Stem came completely off somewhere within 4 months making it non functional.  Guess I should have stuck with a $15 Casio digital with buttons.  Forgot how much functionaityl is missing from analog watches (no month indicator, day counter which indicates 31 days in every month and thus has to be reset.  Inexpensive with a relative nice looking fabric/leather strap which peridically would come unbuckled.  Using it to ""decorate"" my dresser with other deposable junk.",0
4,nice,1
5,Great product to keep hair under control and absorb sweat. I use it when working outside and doing cardio. It’s better than a sweatband and more durable. More comfortable. Easy to adjust and stays in place. I wish these were military issued.,1
5,"Love these.  Super soft and print is awesome, will go with black, grey, cream or browns.  They are my go-to leggings, even though I've bought so many more.",1
5,"This is not 100% full grain leather, only the upper layer. However, can't complain for the price. Best belt for the price.",1
3,Material see through,0
4,my husband loves dogs and loves to cycle-so these were perfect,1
5,Great product. Very lite to wear and stylish. Looks more expensive then it real is.,1
5,"Nice jacket. Good quality. Perfect weight. Arrived quickly. Size is true.  Would recommend purchase.  Very satisfied.  Good buy, great for the price.  Very impressed.",1
1,Did not fit well,0
4,"I wish this had elastic or something around the hood to allow it to fit closer to his head. Also the fabric is not waterproof but for this age, not a big deal. This is a well made suit with full fleece lining down legs and sleeves. Easy in/out because of the zipper on the legs.",1
1,"Bebe leggings fit great when the size is true to chart. However, lately they seem to label their clothing by chance. I have Mediums that fit like Large and Large that fits like Medium. My last purchase was a Large that fit like a Small - that was when I decided I'd rather purchase them in person. The worst thing is that even if you notify their team, they really don't care - they're killing their own brand.",0
5,Love it. Perfect!,1
5,Very nice<br />Better than I expected,1
1,Shelit very bad. Not proportional forms. The impression as if workers did not have lighting when they worked.,0
5,I'm normally a 34D but I'm 5 months prego so I wasent sure what size I would be. I got a large and even with the padding it fits great!,1
5,great quality and arrived quickly.  It made my comic con costume turn out awesome!,1
1,The front hangs odd... I really love the top of the dress but I REALLY HATE the bottom,0
1,"It was too small. I ordered 18-24 m, and it looks like it’s for a 6 month old. Not to mention the zipper wasn’t even attached it was just sitting in the bottom of the plastic bag it came in.",0
1,I was expecting a brown pallet like the picture but got all these expctic colors. Didn't matter anyways all the colors were smashed and this pallet is now in the trash. Save your money.,0
2,"So I stupidly followed the advice of other reviewers and bought the S/M size, as a women's 8.5 shoe - they HURT!  They're way too tight on my calves, literally digging into them to the point of pain.  By the end of my flight, it looked like I had rug burn, and my legs hurt to touch!  I had to put neosporin on them and take a painkiller.  Ouch :(",0
5,Excelente,1
1,This item totally fell apart -- the strap came off and both glass lenses fell out.,0
5,Super stylish,1
5,"very well made. some dangly charms break, this is very sturdy",1
2,"The sizing is inconsistent. I tried ordering different colors and sizes, but only one fits me well enough to wear. All sizes are short in the waist, even though I am an average size 10.",0
5,"This skirt is great. Boy shorts underneath are breathable. Orded the white in size L. Fit perfect. I am 5'3"", 157 lbs. Very flattering. Using it as a swim bottom.",1
5,cheap material and such but to be expected for the price. The color for the pink to orange fade is very vibrant. Gives one a very john Lennon look. Be careful to get a glasses case because they WILL scratch in your purse.,1
5,Fit as expected.,1
1,"Don't bother, it isn't even worth the $3.12. Cheap and falling apart after two days.",0
5,It’s super comfortable. I have been wearing almost every day. It’s warm too. And also since im almost 5 months pregnant has been super comfy and it doesn’t hurt around my belly.<br />I would suggest for everyone. It’s worth every penny!,1
5,I bought it for a friend of mine as a gift and I loved it. I'm about to order a next colour for my self,1
2,It fit well but the material is super thin. You could see the lines from my leggings under it. I returned it.,0
2,The outfit looked exactly like the picture.. I ordered a 2x however it was still too small in pants..,0
1,Too tight and very uncomfortable,0
5,"Runs small, size up. Very thin, light and pretty",1
1,Fits nothing like the pic unless u areva size zero,0
5,"Wrap yourself up in a rainbow. Its soft, attractive and bright. Definitely stands out in a crowd. Careful how you wash it- frays easily.",1
5,Perfect for my daughter’s dance. Comfortable.,1
2,much shorter then the picture,0
4,Comfortable and warm for wearing around the house.  The bottom is kind of narrow though.,1
5,"I love this dress style and colors. I’m 5’3”, 140 lbs and the medium fits perfectly. I have 5 different colors/patterns in this dress and all 5 fit just right!",1
3,Item runs MUCH smaller than indicated.,0
5,These fit like a glove and are so cute! I love them! ❤️❤️,1
1,I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and bought a size larger than needed - it is a TENT! Not only is it too big but it's also that soft fabric that stretches out within the first hour of wear - think flows sleeves with wrinkles instead of fitted. Not a good buy.,0
3,The black dye in the black suit bleeds into the orange & white ruining the suit when wet‼️,0
2,"Purse did not feel secure and felt like it would have easily broke within a couple of weeks of using it.  My purses go through a lot of abuse.  And as another reviewer stated, I noticed the lining being caught in the zippers when I was checking the zippers.  I will be returning it.",0
1,The chain links are so weak and break when you try to clasp it around your neck. I kept putting it back together with a needle nose plier and it kept breaking when I tried to put on. I gave up trying after like 7 times. Not a good product.,0
5,"It fits wonderful, it's a perfect fit. And looks great just as the picture.",1
1,A 2x is more like a large. Emailed the company and has they don't do anything,0
5,Love the scarf!,1
3,"This 2-piece is definitely flattering! However, the design is completely different from what was advertised 👎🏼",0
5,"Perfect fit, loved it the material is nice",1
3,"Dress is really cute, fit well.  My only complaint is the belt is black and the dress is blue.  There are also no ""guides"" for the belt and the belt was just a regular piece of ribbon.  I will be searching for a new belt!",0
5,"I knew that a Russell product would be great, but this was better than I expected.  Soft lining keeps me warm and the ""double"" hood is incredible.  Wish more were made like this sweatshirt.  Only negative is not being able to use fabric softener because of the moisture wicking fabric.....",1
1,"This is so ugly in person, it could be the color I can’t figure it out. But I gave it away.",0
1,Costume was junk and the straps were already broke off I had to safety pin it and it was a lot bigger than I hoped. Super cheaply made and do not recommend.,0
5,"A nice small purse for vacation.  Phone, wallet, etc",1
1,"A pair of the gauges had clearly been used and had dry skin and residue on them. I'm beyond disgusted. I bought what I believed to be ""new"" piercings only to have used literally crusty ones. Listen to other reviews and avoid these, the price is not worth it.",0
4,my husband loved these pants. I find they wrinkle more than I would like.,1
3,"The shirt is cute. It held up after the wash and the image is still there. The skirt was cute, but not quite as pictured. You really needed to fluff it out. It also did not survive the wash. I would suggest putting it a garment bag on top of washing it on delicate.",0
5,This is a Zephyr adjustable hat. It is made of 35% cotton and 65% polyester. The back half of the hat is a mesh fabric. It comes with the brim of the hat already curved.,1
1,"This tutu was poorly made, not much tulle so it was very thin, and so small my teen daughter who is a kids size 14 could barely fit into it!",0
5,Note it's women's not childrens,1
2,"Nice well made glasses. The base lens is BROWN. I had asked the Amazon community for advice regarding the color of the base lens. I was told these were  &#34;GREY&#34;. They are NOT. I purchased these glasses based on the pictures included on this site as well as, the Amazon Community.<br />I have since returned these for refund.",0
4,"Love these yoga pants, they're good lounge pants. They fit great, but they're not completely squat proof. I wear them around and to classes and such but I wouldn't suggest wearing them to the gym. I ordered my actual size as well.",1
3,The waist is kind of too large.,0
5,The material is awful.  Stiff  even after washing,1
5,"Just as pictured, it is a thin hoodie, but colors are great very bright just like the pics. I ordered a med for my 6 yr old it might fit just right...",1
5,The craftsmanship is perfect and the bracelet is comfortable to wear.,1
2,I was likely expecting too much but was soooo disappointed when I got this. The fabric is legit what you would consider wearing as a beach cover up. The gathering on the sides that are seen in the photo are literally only realistic if you were to buy a size smaller. The colors and style would be beautiful if this didn’t scream “swimwear”.,0
2,These gowns were returned as the material is poor quality and see through.,0
2,"I really liked the style of these, but one fell out the 1st time I wore themand I still haven't found it. I saved the other 1 of course and where it mis matched with another earring. Too light weight.",0
2,"The fit want great, but I wouldn't dealt with it except the material was so thin that you could see my underwear through it which isn't something I feel comfortable with especially at the gym.",0
5,Exactly what I was looking for.  I have a very small wrist so it fits perfectly.,1
2,Super super small,0
5,Exactly as described - fast shipping!,1
3,Good material for the price. But I am 5' 1&#34; and 110 lbs. and a small was too big.,0
5,I love the head piece. I love how you can adjust it!,1
5,"Very nice, good for Halloween costume.",1
3,"I like the idea of this shrug, but it is impossible to get it to lay nicely",0
5,Gift,1
5,Terrific!,1
5,"(I only just received it so this is based off 1st impression) It came in a nice dark blue velvety case. The bracelet itself is a great length, feels sturdy, very clean, and so shiny - I kind of don't want to use it, that's how pretty it looks.",1
3,Does not come off the shoulder like it shows in the picture but it still cute on! It fits good but too small to try to wear off the shoulder.,0
1,"5’10” / 150lbs / usually a size 6 / ordered a large in multicolor-2<br /><br />See through, poorly fitted elastic so it bunches up in the front",0
3,"If you love anime, you would like these masks. They are extremely big so if you have bigger cheeks or a bigger face, go for it.",0
1,"We should have read the previous review before ordering. My daughter ordered this and has the same issues. Cover up is too short, no symbols on the back, the buttons do not open in the front.. very disappointing.",0
2,"While I was putting on the suit, I could hear the stitching ripping. Was shocked because the bathing suit bottoms are big on me.",0
5,This shirt was so beautiful with white jean capris! I wore a pair of sandals with it....I would normally have gotten an XL but reviews said it ran a little big. They were right! The L was perfect!!! I would buy more if they had some plain colored ones!,1
5,I just received my earring and immediately put it on.  It was just the perfect length for my short neck and very lite weight.  I am so happy with it that I might purchase another one soon.  It is a little pricey in my opinion but seems to be well made.  Only time will tell how long it will last.  Will definitely give an update on its durability.  Other than the price and I am quite happy with this purchase for now.  Hope someone comes up with different color tassels on the earring.  I have been searching for it for a really long time and haven't come across one with multiple colors.  Perhaps this manufacturer could come up with something like this.,1
5,"Impressive, sturdy, stylish.  This ring does not disappoint.",1
2,Much shorter than the pictures show and not all that oversized.  Cheap materials.  Sending back,0
4,"This wallet is exactly what I've been looking for. Great look, seems durable, great for front pocket carry.<br /><br />But this is for basics only!  3 credit cards, a little cash and an ID (BTW: there is no cover for the ID, it fits snugly under the edges).<br /><br />Like I said, it's what &#34;I&#34; was looking for. If you need to carry more, this isn't for you. It's carbon fiber and not flexible.",1
3,"It's an adorable sweater but is too small.  The 10/12 ran too small for my 10 yr. Old son, it didn't ever fit my 7 yr<br /> Old nephew.",0
4,"Very beautiful. For the price, its great quality.",1
4,"Came with a visible defect (white scratch), but it's not a dealbreaker. Things happen during transport from warehouse to warehouse and during packing. It's still a beautiful design and a nice weight. The picture I'm attaching is not true color-- it really does look scarlet.",1
5,I absolutely LOVE this shoe...I was a little skeptical based upon the picture but they are waaaaaayyyyy better looking in person!!!!,1
1,The charm is very scratchy when I WEAR IT,0
1,Not the socks that are listed. At all. $50 for a pair of crap socks.,0
1,"Didn't even use it and the scythe is broken. I know, I know. My fault for ignoring reviews but I thought we would get one use out of it",0
3,Ok,0
4,Good quality,1
5,Awesome costume,1
1,Bad,0
1,Too small,0
5,As a man I've got a ton of cards in my wallet which bulks up quite a bit and can cause back issues when sitting on it for prolonged periods. This wallet has helped my spread out the bulk and now feels like I'm not wearing a wallet. The RFID is a plus but not what I purchased the wallet for.,1
1,very tiny and thin if you have a bigger than a babys nose forget it,0
1,I returned this sweater because it looked and fit nothing like to picture. It did not drape at all. The return was processed with no trouble.,0
3,There nice but they smell inside and not a good smell either,0
5,I did order a size up only because I don't like things quite as clingy.  This top is really cute.,1
3,Beautiful leather and beautiful to look at. Very stiff though. Am going to try cowboy boot oil to soften them up.,0
5,Very pretty,1
2,Fit small,0
5,"Can’t recommend this dress enough especially for the holidays. I got it for a NYE party, but plan to wear for Christmas in future years. The crushed velvet & this type of neckline are both super on trend, but there’s also something really classic feeling about the dress. It’s a good balance of formal but not too formal. Only thing to note it is a little short (if you lift up your arms it’s almost to your butt). I paired with tights & thought it was fine. I’m normally between a small & medium & went with the small & am glad I did (just the right fit). So size down if you’re in between.",1
1,"Absolute junk. Stayed on ring for less than a day. If you want a real ring sizer, go to a jeweler.",0
3,It looks great but the fabric is too thin and it came already with some lines and marks..I was lucky enough that I asked a friend to took a picture of me and then i saw the marks in the fabric .,0
1,Great item for the price.  I also received my item 15 days earlier than expected.,0
5,Great pin! Perfect for wearing on a ball cap. Great quality and service!,1
4,"The length of the top/bust is awkward. It goes a bit past the waist... somewhere between the waist and hip, not a typical waistline which was not flattering on me.",1
5,Comfortable material with a stretch. Fit as expected based on size chart. I’m usually a large in shirts but based on the sizing I ordered an XL.,1
5,I didn't dislike anything about this pendant and will wear it for choir practice and on Sundays.,1
5,The black polka dot one is cute. Adjustable and fits perfectly. Great for covering your face from the sun while driving on a sunny day!,1
1,I ordered this for my son to wear to an event. The sizing was huge and the product is cheap.,0
2,"I really wanted to like this dress. Bought in 3 colors. I'm an 8 so I got the medium. The top portion was too tight in the bust and there was no fullness to dress at all.  Wasn't swing style as I wanted. And the dress was a bit short, hit me middle thigh if that. Too bad because the color ranges were amazing.",0
5,"I don't think it has that good quality but it will show you look shiny and beautiful. Therefore, I still think it's a good dress for those people who wanna to wear this for performance in those big stages.",1
5,Great quality!,1
5,Love the vibrant color!  Definitely buying again.,1
3,"Nothing to rave about, really, but I love the colors.",0
5,Looks great and sturdy.,1
5,"Love at first site... Beautiful dress, we have to tailored but was worthy.",1
2,My daughter wore the costume today for the 2nd time and the tail fell off. It did not get stepped on or compromised in any way. Very disappointed.,0
4,"It is a cute pattern and a nice sized bag.  My bag was missing the shoulder strap, and the seller offered to send me out a new one.",1
5,Good quality and perfect size!,1
2,"Quality not great. Shiny and flimsy material, does not look like in pictures",0
5,Purchase for a charity,1
1,Not something I’d wear out I’d house but it’s ok for inside.,0
5,Exactly  what I expected I love it,1
5,"fits great, perfect for the ocean",1
5,Cute! Wore for my high school history project lol,1
5,Bought these to restock my stash that depleted over the years. I love having all the different color options. I wear one every day and it fits great! I wanted a ring for my septum that was on the petite side and these are perfect.,1
3,Don't get dark enough when needed...,0
5,I've ordered XL and they fit perfect! Quality material as well.,1
4,"looks very nice but I wish I had not listed to other reviews that it ran large, I usually wear a small in tops and ordered a medium and is a little large. I am not skinny at all so I was surprised.",1
5,It’s great for summer!  It’s still appropriate,1
5,Excelente,1
5,Very beautiful pair of turtles. Looks a lot better than the pictures. Arrived very quickly and well packaged. Going to be a Valentine's day so hoping my lady friend will as pleased with it as I was.,1
5,bride was ecstatic! And beautiful!,1
5,My 3 year old loves to wear this cute tutu to her ballet class.,1
3,The straps along the back where snapped into place. The shoulder strap that these snapped into was too long so this caused the front top to hang way too low causing some issues.,0
2,"Cons:<br /><br />Not waterproof!<br /><br />Fairly cheap, threads coming undone and you can hear them snapping if you stretch too far.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Looks really good on my legs. 👌 Just like the photo.",0
5,I really like these masks the size is good for a women’s face and they have multiple layers so you feel protected. I’ve purchased multiple masks and these are my favorite so far.,1
5,I’m 95lbs 5 foot 32B bust. The small fit me just right.<br />I like the light weight fabric perfect for summer I recommend this shirt. Well made. Stitching is good quality<br />I also like the shirt goes down below my hips.,1
5,Gift,1
5,This belt is the perfect with it's not to thin perfect to wear with pants or dresses. Great quality it's real leather.,1
5,Wonderful bracelet. Very beautiful! Worth the buy!,1
1,The slit was WAY too high showed my bum!,0
5,Love it!!! My fingers are small so not a lot of options as far as which finger I can wear it on because it only fits my thumb.... I love it anyway and will but in gold tone as well.,1
5,Fits great and design is exactly what was shown. Love the adjustable ear straps,1
2,It bleaches after first wash,0
2,Time will tell but it looks and feels cheap,0
5,Perfect for my costume!,1
1,Not as impressive as picture,0
5,Fit nicely. Thicker than anticipated.,1
3,Material is way different from what you see in the picture,0
5,"This thing is really nice. I've been looking at a few different styles of these things and am really glad I settled on this one. It looks wicked cool, its nice and thin, blocks the rfid readers, and holds all my cards nice and tight.",1
5,"It is well made, bright so easy to see. I gave it to my mom because it would be easy to find. I had to explain what a Rotory was but now she thinks it’s cool",1
1,Not very soft. Cheap quality,0
2,"I’m 5’8 and when I tell you my whole ass is out, I for sure can’t wear this out. It’s a cute dress if you’re shorter also it’s a thick velvet material. If it was longer I’d keep it.",0
2,"fit was too small, gave it to a friend",0
5,Very nice and it fits perfectly!,1
3,cheap but cute. the sloppy cutting of the material makes it dig into your skin. I haven't felt my feet in years so I'm used to uncomfortable shoes?,0
4,These are more playing shoes so I rated them based on that. These are not shoes you wear to go hiking or shopping.,1
1,Not well made. Not the color I ordered. And it included some hideous pink striped garment I never ordered.,0
5,"I needed a couple of ties so figured these would get the job done but was far more impressed than expected once they arrived. First, this two pack comes boxed in a divider that works well for gift giving or organizing...either way is nice. Next, I really like the non-slip secure backing, the length (perfection) and the size. These are the Goldilocks of ties. Versatile colors, better than hoped for quality.",1
4,purchased these for a fun night with my friend we both loved them,1
2,"love the design, looks great in the picture, but, it's WAY too small...ordered 2 sizes larger than I usually wear and it was still too small",0
5,"I instantly became the big bad flavor daddy, Guy Fieri, when I donned this majestic flamed masterpiece.  I've never made so much donkey sauce in my life!  I've started looking at doublewides in Flavortown.  I think I deserve it.",1
2,Seam Threads were already unraveling straight out of the package.,0
5,Very cute bag.  Perfect for summer.  It's huge (see picture) and holds everything I need to take to work and class.  It seems very well made and the canvas is very heavy.  Great choice.,1
3,"The vest is very boxy. Definitely will not fit my 23lb almost two yr old. Seems ok otherwise, I'll save it for next year.",0
5,Just beautiful! It is more beautiful in person then in the picture.  It looks GREAT!,1
2,It's a cute top. I haven't worn it yet. It arrived with so much perfume smell on it that so far I've had to wash it twice. I don't understand why there's perfume smell on clothes I've ordered from Amazon. I'm puzzled and a little annoyed since I'm allergic to fragrance.,0
3,The sleeves are not cuffed as the pictures show which is deceiving and disappointing.,0
1,Not a stone....came broken..crumbles like charcoal.... extremely light in weight...have purchased shungite stones in past....,0
3,Nice bag but larger than I thought it would be.,0
5,Nice fit,1
5,"These are the greatest, and the price cannot be beat. I have a stylus for my Kindle Fire and iPhone, and these gloves work much better.<br /><br />I plan on buying more for gifts.",1
1,"Nice shirt honestly it is, but it is see through and made from really heap material. Don't get stains on this, because they are likely to never come out, in addition to that it might just fall apart in the washing machine (cheap material) but it looks nice, but it is also kind of big so order it in a size down from what you are.",0
3,"My ring size is very large for a woman<br /> I liked that this because it came in my size (13.5).  However, it is not as pink as it appears, and it seems to fade when I wash my hands.  As a nurse, that is up to 30 times a day.",0
5,"I bought a pair of similar moccasins from an upscale outdoors store for $90, and these are actually more comfortable. I guess time will tell how they hold up.",1
4,"This top is cute, a little stretchy, and fits about as I would expect.  The fabric is not super soft, but not really irritating.  I like it well enough.  Looks cute with my overalls!",1
3,as expected,0
2,The &#34;non-slip&#34; ? stickems are lacking in durability to say the least!,0
1,Worst zippers ever!,0
1,"Wore the band for 4 DAYS, then the clasp just fell off.",0
1,If you are a big person then you shouldn't buy this. Everything was tight and too small. nothing stretches.,0
2,This hat is for kids! Very small.,0
3,"Long sleeve, not elbow length.",0
5,Perfect fit,1
5,This belt is very-well made; it should last for many years.  The rich color is very handsome.  This is another example of excellent value.,1
5,Great eye glass cases!,1
1,Didn't fit anyone in my family but my 8yr old son and he could only get them to the elbow.,0
5,I’m so happy this came quickly and was exactly what my niece wanted for graduation.,1
4,"The product is perfect, Its a watch with lots of posseblitiesso the manaal is extended bbut at the end you have a watch  with fulfill your wishes. One super inportant thing is that  the nightlights special on this watch is perfect  Bert Geuze",1
5,"Just when I thought my grandson couldn’t be any cuter, we put this on him and voila! He was! As a bonus, the message on it will work until he outgrows it or turns 2, whichever happens first.",1
3,I think it's a little more like harem pants and a little less skirt-looking than I expected but I'm no expert. Super comfy! Great for ladies who don't really prefer pants.,0
4,Love this jacket,1
1,"Loved the necklace, poorly made just gave this present this morning and already lost two of the feathers! Terribly made would not recommend this too anyone",0
2,"It's cute but was tiny, and I'm not a very big person. Bummed because I was so excited for it.",0
1,Waist,0
5,Luxurious feel. Don’t slip off the heel. Perfect.,1
3,Cute hat but is too small. Doesn’t fit my 5 year old grandson!<br />So disappointed.,0
5,Best ever. Made in USA,1
4,"The boots are absolutely gorgeous! I would expect nothing less from Tommy Hilfiger. The boots are well made and extremely fashionable. I normally wear 7w, so I ordered 7.5. The fit is ok. It is a little snug at the widest part of the foot and it took 2 wears to break in the stiffness near the ankles. Since they were a gift, I kept them and wore them. They broke in well.",1
5,I’ve gotten two pairs of these just to keep them on rotation.  I get a lot of compliments. I’ve been told I make gages look classy with this pair lmao I love rose gold with AB stones and these are my all time favorite. I’ll wear these forever. They’re very shiny and the threads I have no problems with. The metal also hasn’t turned any weird colors on me yet with everyday wear. Haven’t personally lost any stones yet.,1
5,"So far so good.  Definitely worth 20 bucks, not any more though.  However, for this style I could justify paying more.",1
3,"You get what you pay for, very cheap and oddly tall fitting.",0
1,Do not buy these.!!! These are the cheapest fabric leggings I have. For the price you’d think theyd be worth a damn. Nope.,0
3,Thin. Material could be better quality. But cute and great for hot summer,0
1,"Looks was deceiving, very small in size & herribloom is about the size of quarter. It's more suited for a child, definitely not for an adult.",0
5,My son loved it. It would fit many sizes!,1
4,"nice, but small, about 7.5 x 4.5 in",1
3,"This soft, lovely bag is so perfect.  It has a nice feel, large compartments, nice new smell and is comfortable to carry no matter how you choose to carry it.  It is a perfect color for all seasons.  However, the zippers pulled apart and nothing I have tried has been able to get them to close correctly, so the little pull slides back and forth with the zipper open on both sides.  ugh",0
1,If you were being held at gun point the robber said &#34;Give me your watch&#34;!  This is the watch you'd want to hand him....,0
3,"While I wanted to love this dress because of the color combination and the vintage look, I had to return it.  When I tried it on and showed my daughter, she told me that unlike the lovely pictures of other customers that had been submitted, I looked like a Swiss milking maid.  The problem is that I am high waisted and zaftig.  As someone with a 36 DD chest, this did not look good on me.  At the same time, the material and the stitchery were both fine.  I have had no problems with this company, and I would order from them again--if I could find something that would be more slimming for me.",0
3,"Looks lovely, but it is not made for tall women with long arms.",0
5,My 13 year old son likes it.,1
1,I don't like this at all.  Way to small and fits funny.  So bummed because I so loved it in th picture.  :(,0
3,BROKE WITHIN THE FIRST 2 WEEKS OF WEARING THEM.,0
5,My daughter loved it!,1
3,Tight shoulder fit. Silver on edges of numbers has worn off after 2-3 washes.,0
4,They were stretchy enough to fit the whole family.,1
3,"WARNING: This belt is really tiny, meant for US Women's Size 1-4. It's NOT meant for medium-large women, so I am giving to my friend for her birthday.",0
4,"I love this bag. It looks great! I was skeptical of it at first since it is really cheap but I've had it for almost 2 months now and it's held up better than I expected. The zippers seemed like they would break easily but they're all still fine. The only issue I've had is that the two little vent things in the shoe compartment have fallen out but I don't even notice them anyway (this is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars). The wet pocket is pretty small, I can't even imagine fitting anything other than maybe one shirt it in, so if you plan on using that for the purpose of keeping sweaty clothes separated then you may want a different bag.",1
2,Voice modification barely works.,0
5,The Garmets are are very good quality but I usually wear medium and they fit more like a large. I need to return and get small which will be like mediums.,1
3,Got what I paid for,0
3,"These hoops were too small to even fit over my ear lobe, so be careful about the size.  They'd probably work best in a very small child or else a place where a very small hoop would work.",0
5,Nice,1
3,The fabric is just so heavy,0
1,Way too big for the child’s mouth.,0
4,"I've used the reamer couple times since it arrived, seems to be holding up well. The price was about the same as other options but shipping was SSSLLLOOOWWWW. Had to wait quite a while for it to arrive (from China?). So if you're not in a hurry, it's ok. Otherwise, I would recommend selecting a different reamer with better shipping options.",1
5,"I've been wearing Casio for years. I rough on watches. My last Casio didn't  break, the watch band did. It was less expensive to get a new watch than a watch band.",1
4,"The description stated that this is a &#34;sexy&#34; romper.  It must be because my husband has been more attentive since I have been wearing it. I actually wanted it so that I would have something comfortable to lounge around in on the weekends and in the evenings.<br /><br />This romper is made of 100% polyester and  feels very soft.  It has a zipper going up the front and a cord at the waist so that you can cinch the waist or wear it loose. It also has a hoodie which I love. I have very long hair and put it up in a pony tail most of the time and my ears actually get cold (my husbands laughs too) so I pull the hoodie up around my ears when they get cold.<br /><br />I am a size 8 -10 so I ordered the L , even though I usually order a M and this romper is very loose on me and it does bag some in the &#34;bottom&#34; area.  I was hoping it would be loose anyway because I don't like anything confining when I am just hanging out at home.  Personally, I just feel comfortable wearing this at home because the shorts on the bottom are a little shorter than I would wear out in public.<br /><br />I am really pleased with this romper and love how comfortable I feel wearing it and the extra attention from hubby is pretty nice too.<br />I was happy to receive this product free in exchange for my honest review.",1
2,Mediums are huge!,0
1,Arrived badly tarnished.  Will likely never wear it.  It's a shame...would have been really cute!,0
1,It looks like my kid has a turd on her head.,0
2,sent back because a stone was missing,0
2,"Fits good, does what it promises reminding you to keep your shoulders back, it's actually very comfortable but what really upsets me is that it smells really bad under the arms after a single use. It says in the description that this product has some kind of treatment to avoid smell but I don't see that. All my shirts, T-shirts and jackets, none of them smell after use, but this one does. For 90 bucks I would expect it not to.",0
2,too small by 2 sizes,0
5,Beautiful!! Better than expected and reasonably priced.,1
1,This was too small and material is thin...I normally wear an XL but I ordered an XXL hoping it would actually fit..it was so tight and then I’ve already started the return process...keep in mind it’s very then not sweatshirt fabric like it looks in the picture,0
3,Was too small.,0
2,Much smaller than expected.,0
2,The shirt was a lot thinner than expected. It is almost a silk fabric.,0
5,Great hat,1
5,"This was for my daughter to wear in the hospital with her surgery.  She loves it.  The robe is lightweight, easy to handle, and launders well.  She enjoyed it so much that she kept wearing it at home.  One thing, it has no belt loops which would have been nice when she was able to get up from the bed and walk the halls.  Otherwise, it is GREAT!",1
4,glasses way cool and different light up options. only thing that sucks is the cabling for the battery. but nothing i can do about that. cable is long enough to put battery pack in back pocket.,1
2,Loved the feeling and bodycon style but the dress is see through. Had to return it,0
3,The tags on this are very misleading.  a 2X is like a men's small.  Nice otherwise.,0
5,"bought for my grand daughter, she loves the chokers..",1
5,"Got an XL weighing 190 at 5'4"". Fit perfect",1
2,"This bag is advertised as a multi colored rainbow tie dyed bag as you can see it is a canvas bag that looks like blue ink/dye  was spilled upon it. Contains zero pink,, teal, yellow or purple.. I had bought this for a teenager and now will have to find something else. Looks nothing like the advertised bag.",0
5,"My husband wears a size 16 shoe, and he says these are the most comfortable socks he has ever worn.  Highly recommend.",1
1,Wish I had read the reviews that said it was not shiny at all because it's true. It has no shine and actually smaller than I imagined.,0
5,Awesome shirt and great quality. My husband loves it. I recommend you order a size up from what you normally wear. I ordered a large and received a medium and it fit perfect.,1
4,The strings was way to long. I cut them to my liking.  Other than that the outfit was a hit. I received alot of compliments,1
2,Love my band wish it was easier clasp to do and it's  showing  signs of wear already  the color  is coming off in a lot of the areas,0
1,Sizing all wrong<br />Refunds extremely slow,0
3,"The necklace that came with this is so cheap - and no matter what color top you buy, you get the same &#34;necklace&#34; which looks like a child made it - will never wear necklace. Ordered peach and pink and the necklace on the display is NOTHING like pictured -",0
3,"I ordered a large but it was snug around the waist but low around the top, if I pulled it down the top and sides of my bra showed. I’m normally a small/medium size and just feel like the material was cheap and just doesn’t fit right.",0
3,"For a 2 piece set, the small fit me well. I have a 32A bust & the top isn’t too big, & I have about a 24.5” waist with a butt so the shorts fit me nicely. They are a little long on me since I’m barely 5’1”, but my butt helps them not be too too long. The material has spandex, but it’s more for lounging than working out, especially because the top is more of a camisole crop top than a workout top (no support whatsoever). The inside material is the fluffy cotton so if you sweat in this then there is no way you won’t drench the material. The gray color is a pretty, light-ish gray. The shorts have the tag on the side so it’s hard to figure out which way they should be worn. I was really hoping to wear the shorts/set to exercise, but it seems like I may just wear the pieces to lounge in.",0
2,Would have liked it if there was a closure on top.,0
1,I’m 5 1-1/2 128 lbs fit just “off” not flattering at all. Sending it back,0
4,SUMAJU big charms Drop Tassel Fringe Wood Beaded Enamel collar statement  Necklace came nicely packed without any damage.This necklace has got the unique design and it is a perfect accessory to your outfit in wedding and engagement parties etc. This necklace is made of wood and resin alloy metal,1
4,"Nice stretchy jumper.  Fits well.  The only thing that I was not pleased with was as I was ironing the jumper, I noticed a couple of dirty areas.  It was not obvious by just looking at the outfit.  I would have sent it back but needed the outfit for a function that I was attending.",1
1,To Small For My Husband He’s 6”3,0
5,Soo cute! Love this dress,1
5,This the best umbrella I have ever had!,1
5,This simple summer dress is perfect to dress up or down.  The tie in the front is such a nice touch and is way more flattering then the simple tshirt dress.  The pockets are the perfect size and don’t add any bulkiness to the fit of the dress.  The pictures are accurate.  I love the light green it is very flattering and the lighter color helps avoid the dizziness some stripped outfits have.,1
5,These are overall very nice and comfortable. They are a little big so may want to order a size down. Overall very satisfied. Do reccomend.,1
1,"I like to wear bonnets to protect my hair from getting tangled or dry. This bonnet does absolutely nothing but cover your hair. You’re better off wrapping a T-shirt around your head, and saving a few dollars. After two nights of wearing this my hair felt matted and dry. This material is not satin and will not protect hair.",0
1,The shoes arrived and were filthy. I am very disappointed. I had to clean the area between the fabric and the soles with alcohol right out of the packaging. They looked as though they'd already been worn.....several times. The only reason that I didn't return them is because the soles didn't show any wear and my daughter really wanted them. The first picture is how they arrived. The 2nd picture is after I cleaned them with alcohol.,0
5,My granddaughter loves it,1
5,"Was expecting cotton not shinny polyester ordered an xl, fit was nice but didn’t care for the material.",1
5,Good product,1
2,"Super thin material, took two months to arrive, cute patterns but two months is too long to wait for something",0
5,This dress is beautiful.  Very different.  I just love this dress.,1
5,So fun and beautiful colors!! Made the event perfect!!,1
4,It was a little small but fit like a bandeau. I am a 38C and I ordered a medium. Still room to breathe,1
5,Good,1
5,Best leather ever top quality but that’s lucky brand.,1
3,Somewhat large,0
2,These would have been awesome minus the fact all 3 pairs had holes in them.,0
1,"It’s a beautiful dress but when I put it on the day of my graduation, the strap broke! I was really sad.",0
5,Love them. Anytime I need to be ok my feet. These are my choice.,1
4,Cute shirt!,1
1,Would not stay closed.,0
5,"Moonsix belts are great! I enjoy not only function and quality, but color choices as well.",1
3,Like way too big,0
3,Size is not correct,0
3,"Cute, but you get what you pay for as far as quality. The white on the strap has started to peel off in places, and when I first got it, the hands would sometimes get stuck. For the low price it's okay, though I don't think I'd buy it again.",0
3,Does the job  ok but does not fully clean,0
5,"I purchased three of these shirts in Neon Camo orange, Blue Camo, Neon Green Camo and green for my husband to work in the hot Florida sun.  He loves them, they are thin, but not too thin, they keep him cooler and protects his skin from the suns harmful rays.  Several of his coworkers liked them so much they ended up ordering them.  My husband requested that I purchase more of the shirts in different colors for him.  I do recommend these shirts, and will continue to purchase them fro him.",1
5,I really loved this product is of very good quality.<br />I really loved this product is of very good quality.,1
1,"We needed these for a costume or they would have been returned. They arrived with a bad seam, which I sewed RIGHT AWAY and they were ripped out after the 1st wear. Seams are almost dry rot easily torn, if you can picture that. Perfectly 80s, though.",0
4,Not true to size.,1
3,for grandaughter,0
3,Fibers from the pajama bottom pilled into fuzzies. They weren't has soft as expected that is the blue pair. Penguins pair I try tonight.,0
3,had to shored a string on each side to wear they were long and hanging.,0
5,These taco themed dangle earrings are lightweight and colorful. Comfortable to wear. They will coordinate with basically any color you choose to wear them with.,1
5,Comfy and stay in place for lounging and being active. Super cute and soft material. I received many compliments while wearing!,1
5,"This is the softness, most comfortable T-shirt I’ve ever owned!",1
5,Fit perfect,1
1,"Bought this based on the reviews. It’s absolutely see-through, cheap, and unwearable. Too bad because the cut is flattering, but the quality is awful.",0
5,These are beautiful earrings. The amber is perfect with the silver.,1
3,"Cute dress, too small though!",0
4,"The slippers and mask are very cute and soft. I've been using them for a month now and I still like both of them. The mask is adjustable, but it is difficult to do so. Also, from using the slippers I can already feel them becoming this squishy, but that happens to most slippers :(",1
3,It's not the bag's fault but it is too large to be able to take on board the flight as a &#34;free&#34; item.  It needed to be a little smaller to qualify.  It would qualify as an underseat item if we wanted to pay extra...but not just a the free item.,0
5,Love this sweater!! It's so cute.  Great quality.  Absolutely love the sleeves,1
2,"Kind of cheaply made, not true to size fit",0
5,"lightweight and sheer. Perfect to cover bare shoulders in my off shoulder gown. Easier than a shawl/wrap that you need to hold onto, this leaves hands free.",1
5,"I love this purse, it was plenty big and completed my Princess Peach costume!!! Everyone complemented me on my purse!",1
4,Very pretty,1
1,Had a couple months and the clip part broke out of no where.,0
3,Gray color is lighter than the image. Size is too long on the legs. Comfortable and okay material.,0
5,"This little cross body bag is adorable and is extremely roomy. Photo shows what fits inside, plus my I-phone (which I'm using to take photo) I'm very happy with this purchase!",1
2,"This product was described as an ""adult hat"". It was not an adult hat, it barely fit a child. Would NEVER buy again. Very disappointed.",0
2,The lining is coming out!  The bag is very nice on the outside but inside is terrible.  I would not recommend this bag.,0
2,"Really wish I would have liked this... The ribbon fabric is not as delicately feminine as it looks in the pictures, thicker and bulkier, it's cheaply glued on, not centered and very uneven. I was disappointed to say the least.  I guess it's the risk you take on these cheap products though?! Oh well...",0
3,Clasp doesn't stay closed. If it weren't for that I would have really liked it.,0
4,"I was so surprised by the quality and fit of these bras.  I knew I was taking a bit of a gamble buying bras at such a reasonable price online but I figured it was worth it, seeing as they were about $6 per bra.  I got the [[ASIN:B01M06PVFN WHITE APPAREL Women's Laced & Lace Trimmed Bras (Packs of 6) - Various Styles]] in a 34DD all lace molded bra that is #55 (3 hook) --though that was the option in my size, and I probably would have chosen a less molded and subtle style.  But they were well made with 3 clasps in the back for us larger-breasted gals.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-bra fit well<br />-arrived in a timely manner<br />-amazing quality for the price<br />-beautiful lace design that's quite sexy<br />-(though I didn't get a set of push-ups), my breasts still look great in the bras<br />- 3 clasps in back and thick straps provide extra support<br />- great color selection!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-not THE most comfortable bras- they are extremely molded and can be uncomfortable and dig into the skin if not adjusted perfectly<br />-sometimes the center of the bra will not lie flat against my chest after a few hours of having it on, making me feel like it doesn't quite fit as perfectly as I thought when I tried them all on (but I think this is more an issue with my breast shape than the quality of the bra)<br />-are definitely NOT t-shirt bras (at least the all lace model)- if you wear something tight and/or see-through, the bra is very visible underneath.<br />-some of the bras make my breasts look quite a lot larger, which is not a look I'm going for<br /><br />Overall, I believe these bras are worth it, especially if you can find a size and style that works for you.  Some of them are even going for $20/ 6 bras which is of course about $3.33/ bra.  I'd recommend these to a friend in a heartbeat.",1
4,Cute affordable watch I use it for nursing school the only thing is I take it off when Im  cleaning patient or watching my hands because water storees underneath it and it sticks to my skin so I take it off when i have any contact with water,1
5,Got the largest size & it fits like a US size 20. I’m six feet tall so the waist & pockets were too high & I cut them out then sewed the sides straight down. It’s cute & soft. Just long enough. Love it!,1
1,"This jacket is a scam.<br /><br />EDIT- and now the company Is emailing me like crazy begging me to take this review down but it was nothing like the picture, extremely small, and all the fur/hair feel off when I opened it and went all over the carpet.",0
3,To short in the back to wear with leggings unless you don't mind your bottom showing,0
1,cheaply made<br />not waterproof<br />poor quality<br />if i did not wear them i would have returned them<br /><br />VERY MISLEADING,0
5,BEAUTIFUL DRESS,1
3,kid liked it,0
1,Horrible fit cups too small very loose booooo,0
1,So small my son couldn't fit it on his thigh. No refunds even though it didn't get anywhere near the underwear area. Really disappointed... He'll just have to deal with a groin shot if it happens.,0
5,It's a perfect for inexpensive jewelry. It's a sparkling gold and very attractive. Packaged safe for delivery. I love it.,1
4,"I'm not super impressed by these. There's nothing amazing about them. They fit fine, but they're not insanely soft or anything. I could tell pretty quickly that the elastic waistband would wear our pretty quickly. I think I've had these on for less than 24 hours and they're already slipping.<br /><br />Update: The company has contacted me to tell me that they have taken my feedback and wanted to fix the situation. I was offered either a full refund or a second order free of charge. They have been professional and have had great customer service.",1
4,Fit right in my shoe. No trimming necessary. very comfortable.,1
5,My granddaughters Loved it,1
1,Very poor quality,0
5,Excellent the product and case!,1
5,I had order this for my friend and it is very good quality i just love it and good size order a size up but the bad part is that it took to long,1
2,It is not a good quality,0
3,"It arrived in good condition, for the plastic lovers definitely a good find!",0
3,The pearl cages were beautiful the downfall to this product was the purpose of these cages are for the pearls. The cages were either to small and the pearls didn’t fit or the necklace wouldn’t fit through the cage loop. We made the best out of it.,0
5,"I've always thought a towel wrap would be a nice idea. This one fills the bill. Attaches closed with a large Velcro. I haven't mastered the shoulder strap yet, but I'm sure it will come to me!",1
1,"These are supposedly ANZI sunglasses. Bought these because of this. When I received the glasses, there is no ANZI stamp which means they are not. I can not wear these at work so I might as well throw them away.",0
3,Material different from prior orders from same maker.  Too clingy,0
4,"Not fe, lightweight sweater, great looking, fits as expected, the front tail part of sweater a little longer than I expected but fits well.",1
4,"When I first opened it I thought it's a skirt my wife ordered:)  They are huge! I tried them on and they seems fine on my waist (I have 31-32,  about 5'6"" height). For comparison I put them with my NB 7"" shorts (grey ones). Total length of new ones, from top to bottom, almost 20"", New Balance - about 17"". They also have no internal pocket, only side pockets and big zipper pocket on a back. Let's take them for a ride! Seems nowadays all running shorts either huge or wide or something. They also very expensive in stores. I either missed a new trend or manufacturers totally messed it up for the last few years trying to come up with more and more features. Used to be able to buy really good ones under 30-40 bucks. Now it's next to impossible to find normal ones under $40...",1
1,"Cheap, poor quality, not really worth it.<br />When I received these, they came in a box that was already opened, one shoe (R) was already unpacked (supposed to have paper stuffing & inside a bag), and the ankle strap (R) was already stretched out. Pretty sure they came from a retail store. The soles are practically nonexistent. You will feel EVERYTHING you step on. The spot where the “cushion” meets the pretty part of the sole is painful & the heels feel like they’ll fall off after use. If you want a shoe that is sparkly & pretty, this pair will do it, but you’ll be in pain within an hour or two.",0
4,"Exactly what I expected, I just wish they came with screw backs.",1
5,"I don't like dealing with trying to change watch batteries- I can never get the watch to work with the new battery- so I get a new inexpensive watch instead.  I saw this watch on Amazon and liked the large easy to see numbers and the simplicity of the watch.  The watch face was a little larger than I expected but I did like the way it looked on my wrist.  While I have had plastic bands a couple of times previously, I think this one might be the most comfortable one I've had.  I do have it a little looser than normal-but the next hole in the band makes it too tight-but while it is looser than I normally wear it -it doesn't slide or move around my wrist either.  I like how easy it is for me to read the time on the clock-one of the things I haven't like is how small the numbers are on watches lately (If the numbers are even there).  It's not a real dressy watch, but it is a nice looking watch- in part I think because of the wide clear band, it just seems to disappear on your wrist with just the white background of the face and the black numbers of the watch laying against your wrist.  I did receive a discount for giving my honest opinion of the watch. I think the watch is better looking in person than it was on Amazon.It has worked fine for me and been easy to read (which is my main criteria for watches anymore).  The band does get smudges on it at work, but they wipe off easily when I get home and  take the watch off.  I think the watch actually looks more expensive then some of the other ones that I've paid more for.  Also I'm a little confused that the description says its movement is mechanical, but the face of the watch says quartz and you pull a tab out and the watch just starts working.  My understanding had been that mechanical meant you hand wound the time piece for it to keep time, but so far my experience is that this is actually a battery run watch (Remember I have bad luck with batteries so I have no intention of trying to open this watch to see if there is a battery in it.)",1
1,Don’t waste your money,0
5,My daughter loves it. She barely takes it off 🤣,1
3,Otherwise like the purchase,0
5,Socks are awesome. Great quality and they are beautifully presented. My husband loves them!!,1
1,Not a good look on a curvier figure,0
3,The tint of the goggles got scratched after the second time I wore them...not happy with the quality,0
2,Of course you think you're getting what is pictured but the colors aren't nearly as vibrant and the print is smaller so it does not  wrap the face.,0
4,Cute lightweight earrings to add some flare to an outfit! Exactly like the picture.,1
5,Very comfy.  I wear for meditation and weekend naps.,1
4,Okay,1
5,Picture doesn't do it justice!,1
3,"The color is perfect and it fits well through the chest and shoulders. The sleeves are a bit narrow and it's quite a bit shorter on me than on the model (and I'm only 5'6&#34;). The fabric is also much thinner than I anticipated from the photos, so I'm not sure how long it'll hold up, but for now it looks pretty nice with a pair of leggings.",0
5,It's long  and wide so it will keep me warm on a windy/cold day.  Thank you.-from jw,1
1,Wasn’t very flattering. Snagged really bad.,0
2,They won't let me post my true review so I'll water it down. No zipper. Pull over head and it gets difficult to get past chest. After you go through that it fits a bit snug in chest area if you are more plush in that area. Still nice. Keeping it. The shipping lowered it another star. Major headache.,0
5,My Husband Really Liked This Shirt! Fits Good & As It Should.,1
2,"Looks nice, but turning the wife's ankle green. Main reason we didn't buy a cheap one.",0
1,This necklace last just a day.,0
5,"I love this silhouette, it's beautiful.<br />The size is perfect, the material is soft and nice.<br /><br />I already washed few times, didn't go messy, no lint so far. That's is good too!",1
3,It is okay..but the leather straps are all over the place...ok,0
5,Useful and get compliments on it,1
1,Wouldn't recommend buying this item. As soon as I opened the packaging I knew it was not quality. The feathers were falling off everywhere. A bit messy!,0
5,"Am very pleased with American West bracelet, quality is fine, receive many compliments. Highly recommend.",1
4,I saw the reviews on here before about them running small and they were right. I would get 1 size up if I were buying again. The other thing is the picture makes them look more Jean like and less stretchy but they in fact are very stretchy. They are tight fitting all the way down to the ankle. I do however like that it has a zipper along with the buttons so you dont have to squirm out of it if it's a little tight.,1
3,Warm and comfey but I wouldn't buy them again.  The non slip strips come off easily.,0
2,"I loved the look and size of the earrings them selves, however the gauge on the posts were too big. It was actually difficult to try and get them in my ears. Had to return them . A shame too because I really liked the look of them",0
2,Smaller than I thought. Guess I should have measured.,0
5,My new fav earrings. Soo fancyyy!,1
2,I returned the dress. It is pretty but not for me. I was looking for a dress for a wedding and I felt like the mother of the bride.,0
5,Excellent product highly recommended,1
1,"The item in the picture and the description are not at all what I received.  It is not linen, it is not embroidered, and it does not have a seamed border.  It is a cheap stamped on picture that feels like flannel. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  It is a fraud.",0
3,"It fits, but at a 2xl size, it is insanely tight. I usually get XL gloves, but with these being winter gloves, i went larger, and they were still really tight. THat being said, they are insanely comfortable, and warm.",0
4,"One star minus because of the chain. The chain is very very thin and unnoticeable if you wear it. In the picture it looks like thin but still visible. The super thin chain has its own effect, for example it keeps people attention on the pendant. However it is very easy to break or tangle and hard to untangle it.<br /><br />The pendant is beautiful. It looks very real.",1
5,Absolutely beautiful ring!! I'm very picky with the height of the ring on my finger..and this is perfect!! I loved it so much I bought 2!! Great buy!! No complaints!,1
1,The quality of this bib is terrible.  It would be of no use on a child.  I like the picture and saying but so not worth the $.  I have requested a full refund without waiting my money to send it back.  I will report back on how that goes.,0
2,"Arms too tight and pants too large and long. Armor looks pretty decent for leather, but the base of the costume needs to be altered.",0
3,"Shorter than expected. I'm only 5'6"" and it looks like high waters",0
3,"A medium was WAY too large on my 36-38-36 frame.  I think I had at least 6"" extra in the breasts!  Fabric also looks like it will be a nightmare to iron.<br /><br />I returned it.",0
2,"Poor quality printing.  Arrived with a glob of printing material on the lettering.  Sent back for refund.  Also, runs 1-2 sizes small.  I usually wear small, sometimes medium, and the large fit.  I'm 5&#34;2, 116 lbs with broad shoulders for reference.",0
3,Nice and fit good but got ripped after 1 month,0
4,"Super cute top. Material is soft & it fits nicely. Top is cut a little big but that makes it perfect for lounging around, errands or tying up for a cute brunch look.",1
1,Do not buy!!! I received a tip that looked nothing like this picture. It’s not even wearable.,0
5,Love it! Have wore it every day since I received the chain.,1
5,"Perfect form, fit, & function for our 8 y.o.",1
5,"Such a pretty solid bracelet.  I love how it's made doesn't feel heavy or cheap.  I wear it most weekends when I go out on my dominant wrist. Yesterday at was cleaning the bathroom with gloves and you can hear the jingling from my bracelet but it did not break,  or get damaged. I will be buying as gifts.",1
3,The item just arrived. Good size and nice looking but like a lot of other reviewers have said it has this strong smell that is nauseating. I am not sure if I would like to keep the product and wait to see if the smell fades away. Its that overpowering. Very unfortunate since the bag itself seems very good for the price.,0
5,"I've been wearing this all the time since I bought it. It is not a large piece, and it's on a 16 inch chain so it is proportional to The length of the chain. It's very pretty. I am glad I thought it.",1
3,Cute but pretty dang tiny. I bought another brand of the same style in the same size and they were much more true to size.,0
4,"This hat just didn't sit right. It was too tall to sit comfortably for the wife. The chin strap is one of those ""bound to irritate the fabric sensitive"". For a sun hat, a black one especially, was thicker than I feel it should be, although, it does do a great job of keeping the sun out of the eyes. A decent hat still nonetheless.",1
1,Too gaudy and way too much material,0
5,Fantastic product will buy it again Thank you,1
2,Scratchy and uncomfortable material,0
3,"Very beautiful, fit just as expected. Only problem is i had to find and pay someone to sew the rest of sequence on the waistline of skirt and around the top where seller didn't finish.",0
5,Great watch. Even better deal. Nicely packaged as well. Wish I could find more at this price.,1
5,Wanted something that was cool and comfortable for hot summer nights.  Fabric is like butter!  Fits true to size and so comfortable.  Really like the below knee length!  Have now bought several for myself and as gifts!,1
2,"Top is very cheap looking and very unforgiving around the stomach. If you have a few extra pounds mid section, order with caution!! The fabric felt like a bathing suit. Returning.",0
2,They were too large. The frames rested on my cheek bones,0
5,"My son loves these masks. They are really good quality, comfortable and washable.",1
3,"This dress is not sized according to US standards.  I wear a misses 16 in everything.  I checked the size chart and ordered a 2X (actually thinking it would be too large), but when I tried it on it was rather snug.  If you like a tight fit, this one is for you.",0
5,Perfect. I’m going to buy every color!,1
3,Very short,0
2,Not the same quality as previously purchase items from this brand.,0
2,My son was wearing this light winter down jackets ，When he take off it has a lot down on he black T shirt ．I try three day it keep happen．,0
3,I like it. You have to bit down hard and it's got a heavy draw. Outside of that. It keeps me hydrated for half the day.,0
5,Great gift,1
2,Very cute and fits everywhere but the chest. Had to return,0
4,Fits the IPhone 5s without a problem. So far so good!,1
1,The shirt IS NOT true to size and is extremely smaller than expected. The material is extremely thin as well and the image is really gritty and cheap looking. I definitely would not recommend this item and wish I never would have bought it.,0
5,"Great experience, products came quickly!",1
2,Arms are alittle small,0
5,"The most comfortable band! Easy to put on, take off!",1
5,Very cute.  Will make a nice father's day gift.,1
3,"The material is a little cheapy, after a while the color fades to a copper shade. I still like the look and wear it everyday, just wished it was better quality.",0
3,Nice material.  Runs big so I just will wear around house.,0
5,One of my fav bags,1
1,Beautiful beanie but unfortunately too small,0
4,"Nice quality, small was too large for our Bishipoo- so sold them to neighbor who has a larger dog.",1
1,Only thing my daughter shoes only worked for one day when we charged them they never came back on and she only wore them once,0
4,"Great wallet and good material. The only thing I wish it had was a hole cutout in the ID screen for easy removal. Other than that, I'm happy.",1
2,"The sizing chart is spot on. If you normally wear a medium, a medium will fit just right. I'm sure the same goes for the other sizes as well. Other than the jacket fitting, I was extremely disappointed with this product. The neck opening is so wide that several inches of your tee-shirt show, which looks strange. The jacket is made from a cheap, scratchy material that is very uncomfortable. The Velcro straps along the waist bunch up the jacket and make it look frilly. The picture makes the jacket look awesome, but it just doesn't hang the way that it should. I've worn the jacket maybe 10 times, and finally just hung it up and got the old leather jacket back out. You get what you pay for. If you buy a cheap jacket, you'll get a jacket that has made several compromises.",0
5,"This slipper was for my husband.  He has trouble with his feet.  He needs orthotics in his shoes and slippers.  He is so happy with these slippers he doesn’t take them off.  He loves them, they  do what they advertise to do.  I would recommend these to anyone with any feet problems.",1
5,"I ordered an extra large.  I'm 5'7, hourglass, size medium.  This fit perfectly.  I hate ordering an XL but after reading the reviews, I'm glad I ordered up!",1
3,Excellent product fast service,0
4,Little bit large even for my size 9 feet!  But they are very soft and comfortable.,1
5,The pattern,1
1,I dont have an abnormally large neck and this didn't fit my neck at all. It seems to be fit for a child.,0
2,Tigger was a sticker/iron on transfer. I have Piglet & Eeyore hats that are stitched. Those hats were comparable in price.,0
1,Completely see through- you cannot wear this dress without another dress or slip under it.,0
1,"It's ok, too big. I bought a large and I am a 38 DD. The straps are not adjustable so it sort of doesn't support the way I want it to. It is very thick and therefore it would make you sweat alot. The pads don't seem to stay in place inside the bra. Gotta send it back.",0
3,These shoes where way smaller than the size scale. Couldn't even wear them ended up giving them to my niece.,0
1,I DONATED THIS TOP. LOOKS TERRIBLEEEEE,0
5,"I get so many compliments with this cheap little hat... It doesn't look cheap, but the price payed off",1
5,"These are so cute, detailed, and beautiful colors! Good quality and nice variety. Very happy with this purchase 🤗",1
5,Excellent,1
2,"The print is nicer on the screen, an the fabric is really flimsy. Sent it back.",0
5,I love that the product matches the photo and is true to size! I will buy other colors in the future as well.,1
1,"My brother purchased these for my elderly father (from the company, not through Amazon).  He didn't notice a difference.  When we visited them recently, we had my 8 year old son, also red-green colorblind, try them on, and unfortunately he also reported there was no difference.  I really hoped these glasses would work, but guess it depends on the person.<br /><br />They were quite expensive, and my brother purchased prescription glasses for my father.  It turned out to be a waste of money.",0
3,"I work in -4 degrees, fingers still gets cold! This is why I gave it 3 stars.",0
2,Too heavy and scratchy.,0
5,I LOVE this shirt.  The only complaint that I have is that the sleeve is too tight at the wrist,1
5,"This shirt is adorable.  It does run a little small though.  I would have ordered the next size up, but it's fine otherwise.",1
5,"Very high quality leather, with excellent tanning. Looks, and performs like a much more expensive belt. I would rave about it, even if not fully adjustable, but the adjustability is spot on. When they first started releasing adjustable belts, in general, they worked, but the buckles could be a pain in the neck. This one functions perfectly. No more leaving a business lunch, or dinner, and having to start undressing in the men’s room! You can tighten this up, or loosen it perfectly, in a millisecond. Fantastic mechanism, on an even better quality belt! Highly recommended! Enjoy!",1
2,Quality material but the 10-12 year old xl was 2 feet too short not even close for my 9 year old,0
5,Adorable gift for my grandson.  Excellent quality.,1
3,"Great hoodie, but runs small.",0
4,Fits a little big and is thin but I did expect that.,1
2,I really love these boots. They are so soft and comfortable. The<br />8 1/2 run alittle short. Next pair ill get a 9 in order to wear thick socks.,0
2,"Too small like the other dress I bought with it, and the material was spongy feeling and clung to your skin.",0
5,Love these! The size is perfect!,1
2,Product was not true to size at all!  It was at least 2-sizes too small!,0
5,super soft material,1
5,"It is has very elegant sexy feel to it, which my wife really likes.",1
1,No GOOD!!!!!THEY HURT!!!,0
5,This neck gaiter became the perfect convenient solution to Face Covering during the COVID19 pandemic.,1
1,"These socks were described as able to fit men's shoe sizes 6-12. The recipient I bought these for wears a size 11 shoe. These socks were laughably much too small.... they looked like they were for boys. Though they were soft and cozy, I can't give more than a 1 star rating if you can't get the size description right.",0
2,Larger than expected. I material was very flimsy I felt and didn't give as much structure as I would have hoped. I also found the adhesive didn't hold up well and I only used it twice.,0
3,"The sweater was similar to the image displayed, but nothing more. The color of the lips is more of a cream color, not white and the ink of the spots is more blue than black. It wasn’t what I expected but is similar to the product. Probably won’t be able to wear with much as it appears it’s a cheaply made sweater.",0
1,Very cute but WAY to small. Returned,0
2,Not woven. Very satiny/shiny which was not what I expected from a “woven” tie.,0
5,Just what I wanted and needed.  Arrived quickly.,1
4,Super cute and I put in inserts to make them more shoe like,1
5,It's great,1
3,"Product lack details, and is huge. But if you like big rings, probably you will like this.",0
3,"Product was ok, just did not fit my glasses.",0
4,"Fifteen is a bit pricy for the quality, compared to the products offered by competitors. Finishing of item can be improved a bit. Overall not a bad deal, since the price difference is not in 10s of dollars and instead couple of dollars. If it makes a difference for you, i earlier purchased a wallet of Amazon and i would prefer that one over this, as the pull strip gives it out, that item is a bit middle tier product. Overall i will not return the item, and satisfied with my purchase.",1
5,Perfect!!!! Pictures do it no justice! ❤️,1
5,"I put my laptop in this bag. My only complaint about this laptop bag is that the pockets inside are a bit loose and my lap top often gets caught going in, and the opening to the bag is very narrow so I can’t really see what’s going on.<br /><br />But I do really love the bag, I’ve been wearing it almost every day.<br /><br />The outer material feels really nice and it looks great. It’s also comfortable to carry. I wouldn’t say it fits alot of things because it is a narrow bag",1
3,"Frames seem sturdy, and they look pretty.  Unfortunately, in my state, they're illegal because they cover the lower right corner of the plate, hiding the registration sicker.",0
1,Way to small. I can't wear it,0
1,"Ordered this over a month ago, still don't have it... Wish I knew this BEFORE I paid for it... DISLIKE.",0
5,The dress fits me perfectly!,1
1,This shirt did not fit at all. The cut is too narrow in the shoulders and does not fit anywhere else. They shouldn't sale  in the big and tall section if the shirts are not meant for big and tall guys. Disappointed...,0
5,I love this bracelet!,1
1,"This is a large on me. It looks horrible. I’m 5’3”, 125lbs, athletic build, 34 C at VS. The bottom is a RAW EDGE, looks like it was thrown together. such poor quality.",0
2,"The description says linen cotton blend, but the item I received was a polyester rayon blend and did not have a nice feel at all. It is also not as flowy as seen in the pictures.",0
5,Si adorable,1
4,Awesome,1
3,Love it but the material is thin !!,0
2,"The dress was very nice.  Fabric was thicker than expected, probably hot for the summer.  I am 5', 104 lbs and the XS was too long and too big/wide.  I returned the merchandise.",0
2,"Super cheap polyester. Cute, wish the material were better.",0
3,It is light but too thin.,0
5,Nice for the price. I have received a lot of compliments on this purse. It still looks great after a year!,1
1,This sweatshirt arrived marked as size Medium (USA) but it is clearly an XS size AND the sleeves were 3/4 length. I assume that for all of the sweatshirts being made poorly. The material and the quality overall is very poor.,0
3,Ok,0
2,Fabric is too thin. Runs small,0
2,Beautiful image and vibrant tee shirt but it runs a whole size small and Has limited sizes.  So technically they only carry them up to an XL,0
3,I read all the comments and decided it must fit pretty much as expected so I ordered a Medium. Wrong! Whoever said they got a size small and weighed around 140 pounds is wearing her clothes too tight. I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 135 pounds and usually wear a size 8-10 dress. This dress was so tight across the bustline I could see both nipples. Also any bit of weight showed through at the armpits. I was very disappointed in the dress. I'm afraid to order a large because I don't think even that would be large enough on top.,0
3,"If i compare this with CK, ok quality and runs bit small. I suggest one size larger than CK. It has better quality than cheaper brand.",0
3,I like it but wish there were black patent handles to match.,0
1,"I won’t wear this.  Looks wrong, doesn’t look ANYTHING like the picture.",0
1,"Worst quality ever, didn’t like it at all",0
5,My grandson loved everything especially the wand!,1
1,Cheap strap broke same day,0
3,Pretty. Only lasted a day.,0
1,Me an cobrado el producto y el mismo a sido devuelto de inmediato por favor tengan más atención ya van varias cosas mal manejadas voy a salirme de su servicio si siguen así fue devuelto en kool store Bedford Nh quiero mi dinero ya yo no poceo esa chaqueta nunca me sirvió ese tamaño y la calidad pésima,0
1,Don’t buy this watch! Within a couple weeks it couldn’t keep time and now it’s stopped working all together. Waste of money and of course the return date has past,0
5,"Got this skirt for a family wedding n it looked really nice n was a nice price too.waistband a little too tight for me,hence the 4 stars...but really nice skirt especially for the price!",1
3,The slit in the back mostly makes it look unflattering in all photos taken while wearing it. Would rather have a solid shirt. No slit in the back. Doesn’t help.,0
5,Used these for our wedding - people actually loved these. They are not the most comfortable but for the price - they are pretty stylish. We found that people were wearing them as normal sunglasses even after the wedding.,1
4,"Great on toddlers shoes. With those straps on, easier to slip his feet in. I ordered like 4 packs.",1
5,"I bought this for spring pictures coming up.  I am 5'4"" and about 150 lbs, the large fit really well, fits in the chest (36 DD). Too long barefoot. Love the feel of the material and the color is beautiful.",1
1,"Not up to the expectations , surprised that Nike started manufacturing such a low quality product",0
3,The breast area is a little snug.,0
3,Really like the pink top but it didn't fit. Shirt itself was great but built in bra was much too tight. If you are larger than a b cup I wouldn't recommend.,0
5,I love my new socks. They are so comfy and warm.,1
3,"It's ok, I bought it cause it was over sized.",0
4,Very small. Couldn't wear it. Fits my 10 year old perfect though.,1
5,"Wife loved them no complaints, and unlike some past gifts she is actually wearing them. And because men are pigs I got to say the view when she walks out of the room wearing them is pleasing. I am happy",1
5,Nice but these are a bit smaller than expect.  Large will fit a US 8.  Purchased a few different versions.  Quality is ok.,1
1,"Arrived on time, looked good, was easy to install and cheap. BUT the band started coming undone periodically. At first, only sporadically and I always managed to catch it before it fell. Then I looked closer and basically the buckle is worthless. The watchband doesn't stay buckled. After 1 month, 26 days of use, my watch cracked the last time it came undone. Now I need a new watch AND watch band.",0
5,"The sweater looks like it came from a high-end boutique and washes up great as well! Despite its Christmas theme, my sweater-averse son wants to wear it every week - it’s that comfortable!",1
1,Do not buy.  It was not sized properly and ran very very small… And they will not let you return it easily .,0
3,"Expected better quality, but cute shirt overall.",0
3,I thought these were adorable but my 3 year old won't wear them...he says they are too tight..,0
2,"My son was ecstatic to get these slippers for Christmas and wore them all the time around the house. However, as you can see from the pictures, they didn't even last a week before the side started to rip. My son and I are very disappointed in this products quality.  If you're looking for a pair of good slippers as a gift or for yourself, keep looking.",0
3,"I'm 135lbs 5'4 its large and baggy, I have to wear a camo underneath. Other than that, the material feels great and I like how it flows.",0
1,These lights up bracelets are terrible!! They won't stay lit!! They sporadically flicker on and off but primarily stay off. I'm returning them.,0
2,"I was so sad  these showed up in black, but they are super cute nonetheless!!!",0
3,love the watch hate the light for night,0
5,I love it. It looks amazing and fits perfectly,1
1,"LIARS, ACRYLIC IS NOT COTTON! Unacceptable. I waited forever to get hats and now I will have to return them, because I cannot wear polyester. One hat was labeled acrylic, and the other 2 are poly.",0
3,Cute but didn’t love,0
1,These shoes aren’t worth $5 let alone $24<br />Total rip off. More than poor quality. Extremely dissatisfied. These were back to school shoes.,0
5,"Bought them for my son who spends a lot of time in the gym. He loved them enough to order another 3-pack in other colors. Definitely his go-to gym shirt now! They are dry-wick, with small, aerating holes in the material. They fit well and move well. He likes the deeper cut on the armholes, as well. Great purchase!",1
4,It's nice but not easy for the restroom!,1
2,I just recieved the bracelet yesturday and lost it yesturday It was beautiful but the clasp is weak It fell of my arm before i got home $70 dollars down the drain They need to remake the clasp to latch better very upset,0
5,Long enough to wear with leggings or jeans. Nice and warm.,1
2,"I ordered the 8"" bracelet. I always get 8"" and they always fit. It fit around my wrist just fine, but I was unable to fasten it closed.  I tried and tried , but to no avail. I decided to give it as a gift to a German friend of mine who has smaller wrists.  It is a very pretty bracelet. I was VERY disappointed that I could not close it!!",0
5,My big lunch bag fits in this bag. I love it.,1
5,Love it!,1
1,I experienced itchiness and irritation within 24 hrs before my ear started to get pussy.  I can only wear sterling silver and gold.,0
5,Was s gift,1
3,The inside material is super soft and comfy but the outer part feels like it might pill. and the sizing is all wack. I ordered an extra-large because I wanted it to be baggy and stuff. I typically wear a medium and it fits like a medium but it was super long.,0
5,"Works great inside my neverfull MM helps keep me organized and keeps the interior clean, great price and shipping speed too",1
5,Better than I expected<br />Fit over glasses perfectly and look great!,1
2,hi I'm 5 foot and I had read the reviews where they said it was super short. I don't usually have that problem since I'm not tall. But it does run super short. If I bent over I would be showing things that I would not want the public to see. Definitely would have to wear leggings or something under it. Which did not have the effect I was hoping for. I ended up returning it,0
4,Pay for what you get,1
4,Great Fakes! not the best but it saves you alot of money and they aren't too bad.,1
1,"This has no support and would be better suited for someone who either has a smaller cupsize or perfectly perky breasts. The shell cups literally lay right atop your nipples. Also arrived pink, not as pictured white in the photo! avoid",0
1,"I’ve used these for Pilates for about a month, maybe 1x a week... and the cross straps are tearing from the sock. They are cute but very poor quality, so I would not recommend.",0
3,Looks great but digs into the bridge of the nose a bit. Could only wear it for an hour or so before it got too uncomfortable.,0
1,"Terrible product. Lenses came coated with some sort of non-removable oily substance that makes it impossible to even see the screen clearly when looking at it. Somehow manages to do the opposite of reducing eye strain due to this substance smudged all over the lenses causing light to reflect back into your eyes anyway. It feels like I'm just not wearing my normal glasses instead.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I got a defective pair or just the wrong product, but these are unusable for me.",0
2,"Not for me, the pix looks better, it was too big,  i am 5'7 175 lbs with the banana shape",0
3,I ❤the purse but the stitching is coming apart from one of the straps,0
5,"Tried for awhile to find something I could go grab the kids from school with - tuck my phone in and have everything I needed.  This is perfect alone, or inside my purse as a regular wallet.",1
5,I love this headband it's so comfortableand a uniquecolor.,1
2,The fit of the stress is very awkward,0
5,Like!!!! I love wolves!!!!!!,1
5,Great fabric. Brighter than pictured. Flattering with a great shape.,1
5,"This wallet holds so much inside of it. I travel a lot so it is great for me, it contains all airport essentials in one convenient location. I have been using it for about a year and the material has lasted very well. I put two passports in it as well as my boarding pass, credit cards, a pen, some cash, and coins. It contains all of this at a great price as well.",1
1,"Distressed was supposed to be Ivory but as you can see from the picture, clearly it is bright white. I needed it for a photoshoot and there was no time to return it. Very disappointed.",0
5,"My husband says these are the best work boots he’s ever owned, even better than some more expensive ones he has had.",1
3,Not like the picture .<br />Looks good vintage.,0
1,They loose color,0
5,Even cuter in person but still masculine enough my honey doesn't mind carrying it.,1
5,"Fits great. It's a nice hat that fits well, cost less than others what more can I say. Two more words.",1
5,"These HEVA Women's Comfort Flat Sandals will be a great,addition to my closet over the summer! The chunkyness of them is the style for the summer, and the comfort is top notch! They seem to be well made so far! And sizing is on point! And the price is fantastic! These are for sure a grab!<br /><br />I highly recommend these!",1
1,Broke in 10 minutes,0
5,Cute and sturdy necklace and earring set. I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this set because I was afraid it would break easily. It held up to my 3 year old tugging on it and a full day of activities.,1
3,Good,0
5,Fits application well. Very sturdy,1
4,I took off one star because of its bigger size. Could have been little smaller.,1
1,The spinels on both sides are off center so I can't wear it!,0
3,"I ordered this dress for an upcoming trip. Was very excited but the area just under the bust was super tight. Not the full area torso. The cut just seemed strange. The chest area was fine on my but if I had a larger chest I think that would be a problem. I'm returning to see if a slightly bigger size will help. Dress seems super cute and has pockets so it's definitely worth trying, just maybe order a second size as a back up plan. `",0
5,Love these sandals for my 18 month old. The light up feature is cute and they stay on his feet without chafing his ankle. The toe part is fabric so not uncomfortable for him.,1
3,"Soles are hard not cushioned enough.  They looked different then expected but considering the price, they are good.",0
1,Ordered a large it it was more like a small in men’s,0
5,"LOVE IT!!!!!! I've been trying to find the perfect one piece that's a flattering fit all over the body. Definitely suits a curvy body and hides and lumps and bumps you have in the tummy area. I'm usually a L (36D) and ordered an XXL (according to the size guide) and it fit great, the chest area was flattering and also supportive!",1
5,Love these!!!! Turquoise are pretty too!,1
1,"Seams ripped first time use just stuffing with clothes. Unfortunately, I missed the return period by a few days. I have to sew manually to temporarily fix because I am going on vacation in a few days. I don't know how long it will last. Too bad the color was beautiful.",0
5,Cute. Not heavy.,1
4,The socks are very fun colors and comforyable to wear,1
3,"Quality is great, solid build. Big throwback is the size, Im used to big watches but this one was too much.<br /><br />The main reason I bought it is because I wanted both an analog and a digital display. I was expecting that the digital one would be bigger than it is for the size of the watch.",0
5,Just as expected,1
5,fits in my thigh high boots,1
5,Grandson Chef really looks good in this. High Quality material. Recommend!,1
1,Malo,0
2,"Poor quality, not true to size at all. I bought up a size and it still was too small. Don't buy. Only reason I didn't return it is because it was not worth the effort since it was inexpensive.  I gave it away.",0
5,this is way better looking in person than this picture. my daughter has micro braids and a lot of them. this fit her well with plenty of space,1
5,"Many people complain of the strings but it was an easy fix for me.  I just cut them at the bottom and tied them in a bow at my outer thigh.  Many compliments,  Fits true to size for me.",1
2,"I find this sweater is very short, and runs small.",0
1,Didn't care for it not as pretty as it is in the picture which is a problem with Amazon tried to return it it was too late,0
1,Poorly,0
1,"It looks nice but not for a male, the chain its self is very flimsy and the links bend and loosen with out any added force, the chain broke unsuspectingly with no pull or tug. Nice as a gift but dont be mad if they loose it or it breaks in 24 hours",0
1,"I really loved the glasses, the frame and color, however, I have been having trouble seeing clearly through them. I finally compared them to my other glasses that have a strength of 2.5.<br />I then looked at the glasses themselves, and the strength is not noted on them anywhere. Again, I took them off and put on another pair, I was able to see a lot better through the other pair. I put these back on, and unfortunately they sent me the wrong strength or something is wrong with the lenses. I was not able to see as clearly out of them than my old 2.5.<br />I am very disappointed.",0
4,Well they’re awesome. I ordered the 7.5 for women/ 6.5 for men. I expected for them to fit but they’re more like a 8.5 for women. I would of had sent them back for a size down but a relative loved them and wanted them. So this review would of had been a five star but they’re too big.<br />Hope that helps!,1
3,"Not crazy about the material or the way it fits, but I was desperate.",0
5,Super cute and great quality!!,1
3,"Nice silky cotton, I didn't wear it on a beach but I could see how it would be absorbent and helpful in that setting. However, I would like to point out that which you cannot tell from pictures, this is basically two rectangles sewn together with openings for your arms. There are no real sleeves to speak of. That being the case, it tends to slide down my shoulders and doesn't do a great job of covering my backside.",0
5,"We loved these!  Handed them out as science birthday party favors and the kids thought they were fantastic! They were excited about the rainbows, but we discovered that we could also use these to tell where in our house we still have incandescent light bulbs that need switching to LED.  Incandescent, fluorescent, and LED all look different.  So these glasses are great for kids AND adults.",1
5,It’s my new favorite shirt,1
5,great quality for the price. fits perfect on my panerai lumina...,1
4,"Love it, a bit thin fabric, but it's a beautiful color.",1
5,Great mixture of bracelets. So much more economical than spending $10.00 per bracelet at my local boutique.,1
5,Confortable,1
5,Getting up at night much better when I can slide these on.  Very comfortable and helps with my plantar fasciitis.  Excellent shoes.,1
5,fits good,1
1,"Awful! Look cheap, feel cheap, smell cheap (leather???). The top fits across my toes, but is very loose everywhere else. The arch support is narrow and presses on the bottom of my foot, ouch!",0
3,I was looking for loose and lightweight shorts to wear for physical therapy. These are heavy and a bit restrictive.,0
5,Very slim an exactly was I was looking for! Material is authentic and nice and would buy again!. Such a clever wallet with money clipp too,1
2,"[[VIDEOID:ac2d677aafa83780975a030b1bc6f26a]] My wife bought me this off of my wish list. It worked for 5 months. Then the time changed and it didn't.  So I tried to calibrate it per instructions with no success. Replaced battery, no success. The hands just shake and vibrate.  I also see this elsewhere for less than 69 bucks. Very disappointed with the overall experience.  See attached video.",0
1,The band broke on me the first time I attempted to wear it!!!,0
5,My little sister has been wearing it everyday since Christmas. It hasn’t faded or turned. She bathes with it and everything.,1
5,fits 220 lb muscle buid with fleece style liner great fit and feel,1
1,"Size is right, lose style, well packaged and arrived quickly. Color a bit off but that’s predicts with all items bought online. One star because my shirt is defective, right shoulder pops up, doesn’t stick on body. I’ll return it.",0
4,"The shoe itself is amazing! Good quality shoes, but the cat faces on front- they aren’t the best. One of them fell off, and no matter what I use (I’ve tried double sided tape, regular tape, and hot glue) it won’t get back on. The other is also cheaply taped on, but it hasn’t fallen off. The are very thick so I’m not sure if I will be able to sew them to the shoe. For the price, they are a pretty good buy if you know how to get the cat face back on!",1
2,The top stone fell off.,0
4,Really like how it's not tight and i can take it off or on and it does not irritate my sensitive skin which is a bonus! Have been using this for now on since Covid 19 hygiene routine outside.,1
4,"I love these nose rings.  Simple, inexpensive and pretty.  It was hard to get the first one in because the gage was large.",1
3,The fabric looks cheap,0
1,These glasses don't work. They don't have any protection from a laser at all. I don't reccommend anyone buying this product,0
5,Soft and fits my long thick pony tail.,1
5,Very pleased with them!,1
5,Good fit,1
3,When I first opened the package I thought it was defective because of the strapping. Only one side has a strap and the other side has two loose ends. Would prefer straps on both sides. I just tie a small knot in the front to connect the loose ends and then tuck them away inside my bra.,0
1,I I found the sweater with no bag what so ever around I just requnized it it was on the wet froor iam really disgust of start wearing it,0
2,cant zip it up,0
5,I love my ankle booties... My son wants a pair.,1
5,Perfect  fit.,1
4,"Quality is great, but I ordered a 12 for my son-in-law as 11 1/2 was not available.  They are too large and have to send them back",1
1,It is orange not gold!! My son was also expecting 2 chains not one so he was a bit more disappointed. He spent money he earned on something that he won't use.,0
2,The fabric is very thin almost plastic in texture..,0
2,"I used these recently on a trip where I took a total of 6 flights, these tags stayed attached through the first 3 yet came off and we're lost on my fourth. Wouldn't buy again.",0
1,The patches were sewn on the inside of the arms.,0
3,"This is a really cute top, but sizing seems to be a bit off.  Considering ordering another in a larger size.",0
3,"The item is exactly what it look like in the picture. However, mine didn't come with a zipper pull for the front pouch. Also, the zippers in general would get stuck more often than not. Hope this helps",0
4,Earmuffs work for the purpose we wanted them. They are tough for my 7 year old to put on because they are pretty stiff but I imagine this will loosen up over time.,1
5,Great quality for the price. Highly recommended to all of our schoolmates.,1
3,Cute,0
1,I'm not sure if it's the mail handlers or what but I receive this product broken and sadly was unable to wear them,0
5,I bought the jacket as a present. Very well received. He loved it!!!  Thank you,1
3,Very pretty on the front but a little lightweight and the backside is not decorative.,0
2,"Used and washed for over 1 year now, the pants still come off with black dye, constantly stains other clothes.",0
3,I wear DD40 and have a small waist. Got a large and it was way too tight on my boobs. But very cut top.,0
4,Small watch. Light is very little.,1
5,"A lot of ABC (altimeter, barometer, compass) watches are really large and clunky. I have thin wrists, and this one fits me well. It also allows tight sleeves to go over it. The basic functions are easy to use (though the advanced functions take some time to figure out), and it seems pretty accurate and durable. It looks great too. The mineral crystal seems hard. And the solar function means not replacing batteries (which means not having to open the case and mess up the seal).<br /><br />I previously ordered the LAD Weather, but returned it as it didn’t work, and it looked soft and crappy.",1
5,"Es preciosoooo, me encanta",1
1,"Looks nice on site, but it broke the 2nd day after receiving the item. I went to put it on and the letters fell off.",0
3,I like it but too see through and the material looks so cheap.,0
5,Bought both of my grandsons one of these jackets.  They love them - they are really nice jackets.,1
4,"these are great!  i just wish they were big enough to fit 10.5 US without feeling like they are tight against toes.  They breathe really well tho, and the heel does stay up ALL day.  Could be improved with less restrictive fit.",1
3,"I love the way this bag looks! Sadly, I underestimated how much the placement of the handles would bug me. I have to wear it cross body style if I need to be able to get into the bag frequently. I do like the size though. It holds everything I need it to.",0
2,Don’t look like the picture,0
5,Exactly what I wanted. On clearance in local stores for much cheaper but not in the size I needed so I was happy to pay more.,1
5,My Lego superhero loving nephew put it in his backpack and loves that it sets his apart from the other kids' bags.,1
3,"Very pixelated. The application associated with the mask is slow, if your patient you may discover",0
2,Photo makes it look better than in real life. Nice design but diamonds are virtually undetectable. Has a bit much thickness between fingers. Tapered back for a comfort fit is a plus. Returned it because it looked cheap.,0
2,looks nothing like the image,0
4,"I would imagine that for it to look exactly like the photo, the buyer would have to have a relatively small to medium head.  Maybe a teenager.",1
2,Sorry - I don't like this bracelet.  It slides open and drops off the wrist.  I didn't even notice the first time - just found it on the floor of my office.  The other bracelets are more secure,0
3,it's a tee shirt. and was find,0
1,Came already broken,0
1,"I did not realize that the shirt was a midriff, which is not something I dress my 5 year old in. I was very disappointed with this purchase.",0
1,dont seem well made,0
5,Great value for the price. This jacket is very warm with lots of pockets to put your phone keys and other items.  Detachable hood is great for covering your head in frigid winter temperatures.  No complaints about this coat at all I recommend the purchase!,1
3,"The pearls were black, but appears that the charm and earrings are midnight blue.",0
4,Fits well and I like the colors,1
2,Too big for me.,0
2,Loved it when I first bought them. Tarnished after wearing it. Can't return it. Kinda Sad. :(,0
5,Luv luv luv,1
1,I only received one of three and it was much bigger than advertised.,0
3,Exactly as pictured and described,0
5,Love this bag! How convenient to be able to put your sandy flip flops or beach shoes in the bottom. Kept everything dry and it’s soooo cute!,1
3,Lasted until couldn't be returned and then one of the back straps on the right pulled out of the sole. Unusable now.,0
3,"It's nice, looks good. My only gripe is that it seems kind of small. Meaning it barely fit my wrist. And I mean, I'm not tiny, but I'm not THAT big either. I can tough my index finger and thumb together around my wrist. So...I doubt I'll use this much, which is sad.",0
5,Absolutely stunning! Colors are far more vibrant in person!,1
4,I really do love this dress. It flows nicely and I love the pockets :) The sleeves were a little tight but not to a point I felt uncomfortable. If they were more loose like the photo I would've given it 5 stars. Its a great dress and everyone complemented me the first day I wore it.,1
1,"This necklace broke the very first time I wore it. I had it on for less than 3 hours, did nothing strenuous at all, and the entire clasp fell off. Very poor quality",0
1,This was the cheapest material I ever purchased and you see thru the dress. This was the worse purchase I ever made.,0
5,"Unbelievable!?!?  Once you put this on,you are transported to a cylon dimension. Fine people,and they validate your chakra.",1
1,"Wrong shoe for me made knees ache worse than ever, have arthritis in my knees and found out after buying these I need flat shoes. $200 on shoes I can't wear.",0
1,i ordered this in a 2x and it was not at all what i thought......need to return,0
1,This are cute looking bracelets and seem to be a good price but three of them broke within hours of putting them on. To contact the company to get replacements.,0
4,"From the pix, this coat ends above the knee.  And that is what I wanted.  But it is actually extends some 6 to 8 inches below the knee on my 5'9"" frame (mid-calf).  I'll have to try the medium size to see how that fits.  Also worth knowing is that the color is a much darker brown than shown in the photo.  The material seems to be a heavy wool felt. The embroidery is nice.  I'll update after getting the medium.<br /><br />Update, 8 March:  I rec'd a msg from Mythrojan that the 6'2"" and 240 lbs model in the photo is wearing a large.  They did not indicate that there is any difference in length between the Medium and the Large. As a result, I did not order the Medium since I want a coat that ends above the knee.<br /><br />This IS a nice coat.  The seams are good and the material is good.  It is fairly heavy and definitely suitable for cool weather.  Not something you want to wear in summer though.  Just be aware that if you want a coat that ends above the knee, you need to look elsewhere unless you're quite tall.",1
5,Buena calidad y muy bonitos,1
1,Vintage?,0
1,very poor quality,0
5,"Is what I needed , really spacious",1
3,Was not hot pink as pictured,0
3,Came quickly. I expected them to not be see through at all as far as panties showing but they do a little. If I wear black or tan its.just fine though,0
2,"XS was way too low cut and lose. If you like everything popping out, then this is for you. I’m 5’1.5, 120lbs, 34B/C. The long part of the dress was fine- not too long for my height.",0
1,Counterfeit item do not buy,0
2,"Cute glasses, but one pair arrived missing a screw, and the other two were scratched badly in an hour or so of normal wear.  I've had them for 4 days and they're all unusable.",0
2,Didn't really compress much. Still had moobs. It's like a compression shirt that doesn't do its job. Will not buy again.,0
3,"Unfortunately these are a little too large for me. Not as flattering as I would like. They are too baggy, not at all slim fit or hug to the body. I'm usually between an XS and small, but can get away with a small - but these fit like a traditional medium!",0
3,Doesn't fit TTS,0
3,"These lots are going to be hit and miss. I got a nice variety of styles of sizes. I ordered 4-8t and it’s best suited for most 2-4 year olds. One pair was even labeled 12-24 months. I bought them for my 2.5 year old (after reading reviews). Most will fit her now, a couple are going to be too big. Overall, the colors are nice. Only one pair was stained/dirty, the others are fine. For the right price, I would order again. I paid .69 a pair and wouldn’t pay more than that for what you get here.",0
5,It's exactly what I expected.,1
1,Very poor quality! Has extra metal that hangs off the side. Love the color? Poorly designed. Returned.,0
3,Very bulky,0
1,Pajamas were very cute and soft BUT they ripped the 3rd time my daughter wore them. too bad,0
4,I have them throughout the house.,1
1,Item received all balled up and wrinkled.,0
5,"I got crafty with this and used it as a dress for a Halloween costume. It worked perfectly. As a dress I loved it, as a skirt, it’s probably really cute too!",1
1,it broke the second time I wore it,0
1,Came with just box no any papers or card even was like bad stuff uncovered with nylon  !!,0
3,"Looks better in picture, Challenge to adjust.  Supplier was very prompt with my concern and refunded.",0
2,I’m a size 6 but bottoms were small and I ordered a medium.,0
5,I love this necklace!! Very beautiful!!,1
2,Items fit but color peeled right off two off the rings the red one and the gray one. Only had rings for one month.,0
4,"The material is fit for summer,<br />which is Light in weight and not transparent.<br />It will be perfect if the sleeve is in a proper short sleeve and an inch was added to the length of the dress",1
3,ok,0
3,"Lenses edges that comes to your nose left a plastic from molding that if you dont cut, it will scratch your nose. also no padding on the nose which hurts your nose afterall. It sure is cheaply made.<br /><br />And I am not sure what this bulletproof thing is all about. Definitely do not shoot to your eyes :)",0
1,"Purchased for grandchild. Got the largest size, but too small. Please carry in a larger size!!!!",0
3,not as pretty as it looks...,0
5,Excellent quality and perfect timing,1
2,The top part of the glasses is blurry like it is prescription and the reader part is not as strong as it should be.  We ordered a 2.5 and it is more like a 2.  Would not order again.  Hard to order products like this without trying them on first.,0
5,These were for my husband and he loves them.,1
5,Good quality! Fits as expected,1
5,"Bought these for my daughter-in-law, and she loves them. The fit is perfect.",1
2,"This cover up looks very different from the picture online. It looks like a cheap, poorly made knockoff. It does not ruffle in the front as it does in their photo. It's flat looking. Beware!!! I'm sending it back now.",0
5,Fit perfectly,1
5,"Soft material, not see through, and fits just like a similar dress I had bought at belk (just a lot cheaper). Very happy and will be purchasing more!",1
5,My boys love them!,1
4,"This pajama sleep shirt is very, very soft.  It looks exactly as pictured.  I washed and dried it in the normal cycle and it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer but not very much.  I like the style a lot, but would prefer a little higher neckline.  I don't want to accidentally flash anyone if I bend over and am not wearing a bra.  Other than that, it's perfect.",1
4,"Nice quality, has held up after 2 or 3 washes.",1
1,I loved them until they broke the first month of owning them. A tiny screw refuses to stay in.,0
2,"I really wanted to like this product. It *can* work if you’re wearing a dress or shirt that’s tight close enough to the skin to keep the sides pinned down, but otherwise, save your money. I bought this for a wedding with an open back bridesmaid dress. Fortunately with the dress on it worked because the material was held in place, but I am unable to wear this otherwise. It peels back off my skin immediately and barely stays in place. Traveling with it was a joke. Everything under the sun sticks to the adhesive and is so hard to get off, if at all. It just wasn’t worth it. I gave it 2 stars only because I was still able to get by with wearing it that day with my dress.",0
3,"The light is not very good.  This isn't usually a problem for me because I use it mainly when I am in well illuminated areas.  The buttons stick out quite a bit so when I flex my hand I sometimes accidentally switch the watch from am/pm to 24 hour mode.  This annoys me somewhat.  Meh, the watch is ok for the price.  In retrospect, I might have got something a little nicer.  But this may have it's uses.",0
5,"solid and well made.  just the right size. memorial for someone who passed away. size is just right,",1
1,This was way too small.,0
5,I love the colors,1
2,"Strap too short, needs a longer strap or I need to lose 6 inches? 🤗",0
3,they felt like they were going to fall apart but they were really cute and i liked them,0
5,Put together great and didn't feel to tight when I wore them,1
4,They're a little too small but  other than that they're really cute!,1
4,Just as pictured. A simple slightly gathered sheer skirt with slit. Fun over a body suit or paired with a corset.,1
4,"Love this product fit well ,came earlier then posted. New to Amazon  so  I'm really pleased",1
5,Very happy with the quality of the material and size.didn't expect this .have ordered 2 more :),1
5,"Helped with keeping my lower legs from swelling,  being on my feet most or the day.  And easier then the long ones I got from the hospital,  I can put them on by my self.",1
1,The shoes received was of poor quality...loose threads were all over the shoes as if it was not finished.....very very disappointed because although the shoes fits the finished product looks tacky and doesnt look like something I wud let my son wear....,0
5,this is a beautiful dress.,1
3,"For my wife on VD. Hey, where is  the Velvet Pouch? :((",0
5,"Very cute, and excellent quality.",1
5,"This style of glasses is really hard to find a cheap pair that don’t look like wannabes.<br />However, these look and feel great!",1
3,"The photo makes the three colors really pop. When received - not so much. They are pretty and delicate, but subdued. If I had ordered for myself, I would have kept them, but as gifts, they just didn't make the statement I was hoping. Returned.",0
5,Iliketheproduct,1
3,Like them a lot but the removable padding comes out in the wash,0
2,"Too bad. These looked so cute in the package, but the elastic is very stiff and didn't keep it's shape on the leg holes. Weird! I'm a curvy 6. Not huge thighs, but definitely no thigh gap. The elastic and crotch felt a bit tight and like the elastic was too wide. On the outside of the legholes near my hips, when I stretched the side a bit, THE LEGHOLE JUST GOT BIG AND STAYED STRETCHED OUT. And the waistband was a bit tight, as you can see in the picture of the side of my hip--the elastic is hugging in a bit tight at my upper hip/muffin top. :)<br /><br />I am a curvy 40yo size 6/8, and usually wear size 6/7 underwear. Ordered these in medium, so maybe a large would have worked, but I strongly suspect the legholes would get stretched and gappy in no time. Oh well!",0
2,"I really do like the suit. The bottoms fit perfectly, they are cheeky bottoms though so if you don't like that then don't buy this suit. However, the top looks different than the picture... As in there's basically nothing to it. It barely cover my nipple... There's just no material. Also it was almost impossible to tighten it from the back because of the way it cross crosses it only tightens so much. It was very see through, and you could see the pads and it looked so awkward... So I had to remove them.",0
4,"This dress is very cute I love the sleeves and the ruffle the only reason I gave it four stars is because the color is not as bright as the picture it’s still pretty but I would’ve liked it better if it was the same color as the picture. Runs a little bit small, I followed the recommendations and bought a size up and it fits fine.",1
5,Got it for wife who is a Gamecock fan.  It made her happy.,1
5,"The front looks exactly like the Oakleys. The sides are different, and have no logo.<br /><br />You won't fool anyone into thinking you bought $150 Oakleys...but that's the point. They are the exact same look and style, but simply don't have the logo. Great sunglasses.",1
4,"The dress is very comfortable, very flattering.,stretch fits perfectly",1
5,Good material with some stretch but not too much. Seams are sturdy. Fabric not see-through.,1
2,"Bonita prenda, no estira soy talla M general mente. Pedí Xl me tallo apretó, con una talla más hubiese quedado perfecto",0
5,"I have to start this review by saying that my husband wrote the review below because these are his but I decided to take a couple of pictures because I love a good pair of aviator glasses. So here is his review:<br /><br />These Mens Outray Aviator style polarized sunglasses are in my opinion very stylish! I was reluctant to get a pair of sunglasses online without trying them on first becuase I usually find myself trying on EVERY pair on a rack in a store and sometimes trying on a pair more than once before making a decision. These glasses look fantastic when I wear them and actually got a compliment the first time I wore them!<br /><br />As the description states they are polarized lenses and the color of the lenses is unique in that it does add contrast to what I see without distorting the natural colors of things too much. I do not feel like they will break easily from normal use and are a good quality manufactured pair of glasses at the price, because let's be honest if you're going out and buying a $200 pair of glasses either you just won the lottery or your priorities are a little backwards. I find that the cost of these glasses is perfect, almost a bargain for what they offer, so when your 3 year old grabs them to try them on and scratches the lenses or bends them you don't have to have a stroke over it.<br /><br />These are very light weight and rested on my face nicely without having to readjust at all. As soon as I put these glasses on I could feel my eyes relax from the bright sun which is important to me becuase I am a graphic designer and I need to protect my eyes from the sun as much as possible and avoid unnecessary eye fatigue, especially when driving. There is not much more to say about these glasses other than they come with a nice carrying case and a cleaning cloth to keep them protected and clean. Although it would have been nice if the carrying case had a clip on them to attach to a sun visor or something, but definitely not a deal breaker by any means. Definitely a 5 star Item.<br /><br />I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed my husband's opinions trust me. :-)",1
4,Overall the shirt seems to be of good quality and if it fit I would have kept it. The heading on the main Amazon page says MEN'S but when you order the heading on the order page says YOUNG MEN'S.  This runs about a a size smaller than a regular men's size and so would not fit me. If there was a larger size available I would have exchanged it but this is the largest size available.,1
4,I like it. It looks the same way as it is on the picture. The quality is ok.  The only one thing I do not like is the strange smell of it.,1
5,Everything,1
1,"I've always run in Feetures brand socks, but thought the price for these were good enough to try out.  I've run in them twice and they've given me blisters both times.  I'll stick with Features from now on.",0
5,The material feels like rain gear,1
3,Its okay 😕,0
4,This is a good quality sports bra! If you have more to deal with it might not work for you during a high power work out! It’s perfect for activities like yoga and Pilates though!,1
1,"Extremely inaccurate sizing, got a size bigger than usually and still extremely small",0
5,It is the cutest! Back and front are the same. I love it!,1
2,"[[VIDEOID:66f4db48b799bd31df5e2b1fd9496947]] This was or should have been a precious little dress but again, no quality control.  The seams on the front appeared to be sewn on the wrong side.",0
1,Very thin material. Didn’t feel like shorts material. Would not recommend.,0
1,"This product  must be children's sizes not adult sizes. I'm only 5'3&#34; & it didn't even come down to my knees & I got the medium size. They squeezed it so tight & small in the package, I'm not sure I can get it back in. I sent for a return label but it came from China so they have to contact them first. If I knew it came from there, I wouldn't have bought it. That explains the small size.",0
1,"Do not buy , excessive fabric. Unflattering and complicated top.",0
2,Not really what I thought but ok.,0
5,Adorable but sized small. I would go up two sizes for little loose fit. Otherwise beautiful summer dressy top,1
5,"I was so glad I found this for the price it was! Because it's cheaper than most other sources, I was worried it would be cheap quality but that was not the case at all. It arrived on time with good packaging. It's slightly more tight fitting than a regular t-shirt, but you shouldn't have to order a size up to accommodate. It fit just right!",1
5,I love it. It is so comfortable and sexy.,1
1,"The material is horrible. The 95% polyester feels so cheap and makes you so hot. Feels like & looks like the cheap & nasty polyester kids pj’s. Worn it 3 times and each time it was not comfortable. I’m 5’4”, 125lbs got a S. The length is fine but the fit on top is baggy, lose and gapes. The cross over is held by a single stitch. Wouldn’t buy again.",0
5,I love it! Although its bigger than I expected. Can fit my galaxy s4 in it!,1
5,LOVE IT,1
5,I love it! My husband and I eloped and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on anything. This ring is beautiful and sparkly and everything I needed.,1
2,"Followed the sizing instructions written by the seller and read some reviews and the skirt fit horribly, way too big. It’s a beautiful skirt, great material and doesn’t seem cheaply made, just the sizing was totally wrong . FYI, I am 5’4 145 pounds and I ordered the medium. Will be returning.",0
5,The shoes are so so so so cute!<br />Granddaughters love them and they seem to be very comfortable for them!,1
5,Delicate but makes a statement. Very pretty and comfortable to wear.,1
1,This product is for work I use two time know star ripped off,0
5,"This has a very high arch,  the footbed is soft but supportive, the straps have some give in them . Very comftorable",1
5,"Nothing wrong with the frame or lens, both seem pretty good - they just don't look good on me :) This is definitely not the sunglasses fault.",1
2,"For the price, I dont feel they are steady and a little cheap looking...",0
5,Bought these to wear with a Halloween costume...Love them!!!,1
3,"My problem with this top is that it wasnt as long as I thought the picture showed.  I decided to keep it, but I wouldnt by another.",0
4,Love it,1
5,These are very beautiful Jhumkay and great quality. Not heavy when you wear them.  Got a lot of compliments and matches with a lot of my outfit.  Couldn’t have been more happier with my purchase. Love them. ❤️,1
5,My son loves it,1
4,Beautiful nice fabric but runs small need one size up for tru comfort,1
2,You get what you pay for. The frames are pretty cheap.  The arms have already broken off of one pair.<br />Update:9/19/2018 - Three of the Five pairs that I have been using have broken now. I do not recommend.,0
5,Really cute and comfortable!,1
1,Nothing like in the image.,0
5,Loved it and bought two more in two other colors.,1
1,This product was horrible will be returning this item supposed to be high waisted not at all,0
4,"This dress is cute, and I've received many compliments on it. It is loose fitting and perfect for summer, except the material is a little heavy for my liking.",1
1,Wheels Broke during first trip. The large one can't handle 45 lbs of stuff. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,0
4,It looks nicely done but not solid feel. The back is more hollow than I expected but still a good buy.,1
2,"I wear size 10 or 11, depending on the shoe. These are definitely NOT size 11-12 as advertised, they are a small size 10. Also, they are not soft. The memory foam is so thin that it is almost not noticeable. I am returning these slippers.",0
2,It’s pretty,0
1,Too small cheaply made,0
5,Perfect for snow,1
1,Cheap and poorly stitched!,0
2,"Got them for either me or my husband, so I figured it would fit one of us. We just wanted to make sure our arms were protected as we clear brush in a snake mountain area.  They were just too awkward and stiff. We couldn't bend our fingers very well and ended out just using regular thick gloves and hoping we didn't encounter a snake.",0
1,It was the wrong item. Nothing like pictured.,0
5,Love it & well made.,1
5,I like it! It fits perfect and it’s comfortable,1
1,"Dollar tree has better quality masks. This one is falsely advertised, cheaply made, uncomfortable, awful chemical stench.",0
4,"My wife likes these pants, although they did shrink more than she wanted when laundering them.<br /><br />She looks fantastic in them, and so far they've held up nicely.",1
3,Cute but the way the back sat it made my butt look huge and I have a small flat butt so I’ll returned it.,0
1,Material too stretchy.  The small will actually fit someone Large - XLarge.  Looses shape after 1st wash.,0
2,The small is a lot bigger than a size 2 US. More like a size 5/6.,0
5,"One of my favorite purchases from Amazon in 10 years. So simple and a staple - order 1 size up if you want it to be a bit more comfy, but it is definitely worth it. Usually a Small, but ordered a Medium and the length is perfect and a little looser than what the model is wearing.",1
1,The idea behind this product is superb obviously but my only issue was that I could not get any of them to stay put no matter how hard I tried and they were bigger than what I expected which made them appear to be a bit gaudy,0
3,Hat too deep for my head 😏,0
2,Not as big as I expected,0
1,Do NOT buy this if you’re using it to sell your jewelry. The charms tarnished easily.,0
5,Beautiful,1
5,Its cute i like it very soft good quillity,1
5,I use these at my desk at work during the winter and I love them!,1
5,This product is amazing and it came with the right polishing cloth. My rims shine like new . Thanks,1
3,They bend. Bad quality.,0
4,They will work for what I need.,1
1,poor quality,0
2,Wore this for less then 2 hours and little bits of paint were all over my chest. Do not purchase,0
5,The items are exactly as pictured. The order arrived on time as promised.,1
1,"La talla es grande pida la talla que pida, no se puede regresar el producto,  porque cobran como $200 dólares por regresar.<br />Puse una estrella pero si pudiera pongo cero. No sirve",0
3,"I like the style but even the &#34;Small&#34; fit too loose on me. I'm 5'6 120lbs 32D, athletic build but still have some curves and I'm surprised that this didn't fit tighter on me. Furthermore, it has built-in hip siding material (I suppose to project the illusion of giving you hips? For a more womanly figure ?) but it just ended up looking super awkward. The patterns also don't match up on the upper portion of the dress , which at first bothered me. But I now realize that the normal person looking at you won't notice. I don't regret the purchase but wish it had been more satisfactory .",0
3,"This runs very small for my two year old. She is 26 months in photo. We ordered size 2-3T. We had a smaller size for when she was 12 months and they fit fine for quite some time but when we went the next size up, it felt only slightly bigger and we had to buy another hat after 2 months. So either it runs small or my girl has a big head. She is tall for her age.",0
3,"I thought these would be perfect for traveling up north, but I was dissatisfied with the overall fit. They were super long (5’6) and the waist area I felt was very awkward. The back was low rise and the front was more of a high rise. So the inseam looked very weird and uncomfortable. Will be returning.",0
1,No son del mismo tamaño del frame.,0
3,This is just one long chain and not a multi layer necklace as described. I put the necklace on and it broke very easily. I was able to get pliers and fix.<br /><br />I know this is a cheap knock off... But at least describe it correctly.,0
3,Expensive for the quality,0
5,Beautiful,1
2,It's a flimsy plastic lens that hurt my eyes! Other than that they look cool!,0
5,Bought for my daughter to wear on Halloween.,1
1,Did not expect the Asian sizing. This fact needs to be included in the product description.,0
5,Fit perfectly - thanks!,1
1,To small,0
5,"I really like this product. Its a great alternative to a traditional wallet. It's small, light, and practical. A good alternative to a wallet if you are wearing basketball shorts or sweatpants, and don't have pocket space to spare. I was worried that it would be a pain to select a card, but this is not the case, you can sort through and retrieve different cards easily.",1
5,"awesome watch, for the price! super cute.",1
1,Very cheaply made,0
1,Took over a month to receive them and they look nothing like the picture. Too small for me so I gave them to my daughter.,0
3,Not sure size,0
5,"People compliment these earrings all the time. They have hints of pink, blue and purple, depending on how the light hits them. They're quite lovely!",1
1,I Ordered the ivory due to already purchasing one in black on eBay. But unfortunately this one did t come with the 3hook choice but instead all one hook which make only one size instead of having the choice to make tight or lose. You stick with one size only,0
5,Very pretty and great for the price!,1
1,"Gold looks cheap, can't really tell from the pictures.",0
5,"Great buy,  Super cute and comfy! Fits as expected, very pleased!",1
5,The bracelet I received was of great quality and arrived in a very careful packaged cloth bag.<br />I am extremely happy with my purchase,1
1,Very poor quality.  Fit very small,0
3,"When trying to pull some of the earrings off of the paper, the earrings sometimes split into 2 pieces - the clear plastic part and the thin colored part.",0
3,"The picture makes it look like there will be some excess fabric to hang at the top, but this hat is not really that big (and I don't have a big head).  Otherwise, it's a warm cap and I did get many compliments on it.",0
5,Muy bien,1
5,Very well made. Clasp is easy to use but very sturdy,1
5,Awesome<br /><br />Perfect for my work and I like them so much That I also wear them for everyday activities.,1
5,Have used these bands for years . Comfortable long lasting. Have on multiple watches.,1
1,"Right out of the bags, the handles were falling apart at the seems.  Love the look and the size, but the handles are sure to break quickly, unfortunately.  Would be a perfect beach bag of large towels, etc.  Even comes with a cute smaller zippered pouch on the inside (although no inside pockets).",0
1,"Ultra cheap, I've seen some for around this price that look great. This was NOT it. A few stones feel out first night it was worn.",0
1,This product runs very very small,0
5,I loooooove JoJo Siwa She is AMAZING!,1
3,It was tight on the upper body if you have boobs,0
5,Great quality and fits perfect,1
1,"DO NOT BUY ! I got this watch 3 weeks ago and it is not worth it at all. The golden went off in 2 weeks and the third week the black piece around came off the watch. I really liked at first but personally, it  was the worst watch I  have ever bought it has the quality of a 25 dollar watch. I tried to treat it good but it was impossible Keep your money and get a good one because you cant even return it.",0
5,"Looks and feels great, its easy to put on and take off.",1
5,The color was as pictured and it fits great.,1
5,I would order it again. I was nervous at first but it fits good. Even though I mark that it fit as expected it runs small so I ordered a 5x and normally I would've needed an x1 but I love it. Worth the money I spent.,1
1,returned,0
1,Ordered an orange LED and after wearing it once the left arm and the top shoulder area LEDs have stopped working. I changed the batteries and made sure all wires were connected. Poor quality.,0
5,I love this item it is perfect in cold weather,1
5,"Great for Chelsea boots, they helps to keep the fit",1
5,"I purchased these because it had so many great reviews and low and behold, I agree. These are beautiful and elegant. My only complaint (which is just a tiny one) is that they are a bit big if you have smallish earlobes and/or have the piercing set low on your earlobe. Other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase.",1
5,Fits great! Love my outfit,1
2,I expected these to be sweatpants. They are made with the same materials as yoga pants and so you don’t have the soft cozy feel of sweatpants nor do you get the tight compression of leggings or yoga pants. It’s somewhere in between and not very flattering.,0
5,The product fulfilled its purpose.  Happy with purchase.,1
1,This look nothing in person like it did in the picture. Not half as bright and clear as the picture shows very dull.,0
3,Too small,0
5,My wife likes Earrings and will wear it very soon.,1
1,The hook came undone from the knot after wearing for 3 days. Poorly made.,0
5,"Good quality, sized up one to a Large for length & can wear with leggings. Regular material T-shirt, not thin and design is exactly like picture. True to size.",1
5,These earrings are super cute and exactly as described. I love them. The seller was quick to ship and I am very happy with this product and would probably get them again as a back up in case I lose one.,1
1,They are just looking very cheap looking,0
5,Great looking glasses! Very comfortable as well!,1
3,"[[VIDEOID:e6fb013bcce483c481794ac9c3f86d9d]] This hat is simple, fits well, but poorly designed. Watch my video for a full review.",0
1,"I ordered the 6 pack thinking it would be the 6 colors in the picture (white, nude, black...) they're all bright colors and no neutral like I was expecting/hoping. Don't waste your money.",0
4,"Anyone that loves owls will absolutely fall in love with this charm. It's small, very well made and SO cute! I cannot wait to show off this little gem of a charm.<br />I received this at a discounted price in return for my unbiased review.",1
2,Ripped after a couple uses. Super comfy though and fit everything I needed for work. Can’t wait for the replacement. Hopefully this one won’t rip,0
5,Perfect fit,1
5,Beautiful suit! So flattering ! Got so many compliments on this suit!,1
5,"Lightweight, loose fitting dress, very cute pattern & design!",1
5,Beautiful and I love it! Ordered based on my bust size and fits lovely.,1
2,Size small was huge. I'm waiting for either a refund or an extra small. The swimsuit is really cute and decently made.,0
3,A little big for the size but not too much. (Allows for thicker socks or an insert without being too tight) which is a goof thing. The tongue of the boot stays outside of the top when you tie it so it scrunches up under laces but overall great fit. May not be suitable for high arches without an insert. Very warm as well.,0
1,The yellow lens for night driving is a myth. Do your research.,0
5,Love these shoes!,1
5,"Love this! Very cute style. I wear a 14 and ordered a large. It fits pretty well. A little short for me to wear comfortably as a dress, but it's a nice tunic length.",1
2,Love the color and size but the quality is not great and it just has two small holes to put the strap in to wear as a cross body... you have to tie it inside.,0
5,I am so happy I found this! It fit perfectly on my daughter and Everything was as expected! Material was great and Jersey was perfect!,1
2,Would look so nice on my ear but it is too small...should be sold to small children only.  It is very pretty.,0
5,Great product,1
4,Beautiful dress and very well made. I got this for my daughter for homecoming and ordered a small because she is very petite. It fits very well every were but the bust. She is an A cup and it does not quite fit right in that area not even with a push up bra.,1
5,"This are so pretty and very well done, love them. I ordered more",1
5,"High quality, very classy dress. So many compliments and the price was incredible",1
1,"The sleeves are not tight at the wrist, the size say the right size but the sleeves are horrible",0
5,I love this bag.  It's light and durable.  Unfortunately I had an issue with the zipper however the vendor promptly replaced the bag.  I was so grateful since I loved the bag so much.  Great customer service!,1
5,Worth every penny. Sturdy and well made. Gorgeous accessories. I will definitely be ordering from them again. I have no complaints lol,1
2,"Decent last minute gift idea.<br />Smaller than expected but,  works well.",0
5,This product is very well made good material. I would like they sold the sandals on the picture.,1
2,Too Small and the material was see through.. So keep that in mind.,0
5,"Great fit and very comfortable, well put together",1
1,Very cheap. Ripped within a day. Wouldn't buy again.,0
2,For really big heads. Also a couple of them started coming unsewn after the first wash.,0
5,"Perfect! True to Gloria Vanderbilt fit is perfect, style terrific.",1
2,Disappointed with how small this mask is. This mask is more for a 5 year old child or younger.,0
5,Beautiful piece,1
1,"So where to start I didn't expect much out of these as I know you can't get high quality at this price point but it was way worse than I expected my kids are all toddler ages and  love their sketchers light up shoes so I wanted to get them something that would do more but as I inspected all 3 pairs that I bought for Christmas that came today I noticed how poor these were put together and i know they will not last more than a few months if the stitching is incomplete ,they went over areas more than once the toe of the shoe's where  the holes were made for the stitching to go through where to big they added silicone so they won't split from use<br /><br />There are photos of more than one shoe they all look the same because I order the same color for all 3 pairs I wanted you to see that this is common across all 3 pairs<br /><br />They came on time but now that they are being returned I will have to go pick something up locally to have them under the tree in time<br /><br />They did light up and come with a charging cord<br /><br />I purchase from Amazon a few times a month for work and home purposes I always say if you can't get it right at the selling price go back make it better and sell for a higher price or STOP SELLING !!!!<br /><br />I added a screen shot of an email that was sent to me from the seller I think Amazon needs to ban them from selling",0
2,String broke the first day and the fit was slim.,0
1,"Initially I loved this, but within hours it started to ball and pill.  Very low quality.  Also snagged super easy.  The bum looks like I sat on wood benches!  I am sending back.  These pics are after a couple of hearings and no wash.",0
5,These are so gorgeous up close and my new favoriteearrings.  They're a bit bigger than I thought but I don't mind.  Also they are a little heavy so If you have sensitive lobes you may not be able to wear them.,1
5,Super cute only thing I didn’t like was the “inside out” look to the shirt. Looks like I’m wearing the shirt wrong. But besides cute shirt loose fit,1
3,"First- this is so cute! I initially thought it would be great quality and I love that it comes flat and has a Velcro closure.<br /><br />BUT, the entire thing fell apart while trying to unlatch the Velcro. The cute white outer layer pulled away from the felt backing. Ruined.  Happened before my daughter’s birthday party. Complete waste of money.",0
5,Very comfortable. Really good quality. I have bought multiple masks.,1
5,Nice quality,1
3,Not exactly as pictured but OK hat.,0
5,Love my T-shirt!,1
4,I’m a fan of this dress as a Floridian. It is very sheer so it will make a great cover up or staying home day. My husband wasn’t mad at the look of it. It’s comfortably sexy. I’m 5’5” and I guess 140lbs and the Medium fits perfect. However I will not be putting it in the dryer to preserve the fit and length.,1
5,Fabric design does not look like picture,1
1,didn't fit and had to return,0
1,"Not enough cooling beads, not helpful",0
1,"Muy malo, llegaron todos rotos y en mal estado",0
3,Fits as expected. I think its so expensive for its quality.,0
1,"The fit is terrible. No shape to it st all, might as well be wearing a sack.",0
4,"LOVE this bag, my one criticism were the handles. The handles started to fray :(",1
3,The top is much shorter than pictured.  I’m 5ft and it stops at the top of my belly button,0
5,I've been looking for this for soooo long，but this is exactly what I wanted with the fantastic price.,1
3,The purse was smaller than I expected and it definitely was not a shoulder bag as advertised.,0
5,They are nice and good quality. However I would not say these earrings are for babies are they just look huge on the ears. They would be more for a 4 year old and up. Even better sized for an adult.,1
1,There are 40 finger lights in an order. Only 26 of the 40 lights work. Disappointing.,0
5,"Love these, so comfortable.",1
5,Good and pretty,1
2,Product was significantly baggier and more loose than expected. Material is fairly heavy and thick making it even baggier. If it fit well I could see it being a great winter dress.,0
5,Exactly as described. Think they will work well to keep heels from sinking into the grass,1
5,A visually interesting tie. Well built and substantial feeling.<br /><br />The colors give you a lot of marching choices.<br /><br />I have a few from SetSense and have nothing but good things to say.,1
4,Great looking beanie that soft to the touch and very comfortable when worn. This is a thick beanie that does its job well by keeping heat from escaping from top of your head where most is lost,1
2,Didnt like the scrunchy material on the sides and it runs big,0
5,Great,1
5,Great 🧦🧦,1
3,Good,0
5,Very happy with item,1
5,Really cute shirt for the price.  A little thin but not so much that it’s see through.  Fits perfectly.  I bought a medium and typically wear a small or medium.  I am 130lbs and a 34DD with a smaller waist.,1
5,Great shirt! The image is exactly as shown. I bought this for my son to wear to his Godzilla birthday party. He’s 54” and 57lbs. I bought him a Large because it was the only size available to be shipped in the time I needed it. I washed it and dried it on high and it shrunk enough to fit him well. Had I bought this in the exact size I needed and it shrunk after 1 wash I would’ve been pissed. But I bought it knowing I needed it to shrink.,1
5,Great color and style. Nice fit and I received compliments on the cruise.,1
5,Haven't worn yet - beautiful material - excellent stitchery - it fits me well.  I would say - way more than I expected!!,1
5,"I purchased this evening bag for my daughters wedding in October. It is beautiful! My only concern is that the clasp is a bit tight and I am afraid that if it is tugged on too hard then it will break, but I have been very careful in opening it. The two chains are nice to have, although I believe I will be using it as a clutch.",1
3,It's smaller than it looks in the picture. Cute for a kid. Too small for an adult.,0
5,Awesome looking panties! Quality very good and fits just right! Very satisfied with this product!,1
5,Excellent,1
5,"It was nice , just wish it had the dimensions for the pictures",1
4,"Nice light weight vest...true to size, but this red color is a little pinkish, not a true red.",1
5,I bought these to wear in the top of my ear.  They are comfortable and very pretty,1
2,"Sizes run VERy small. Soft fabric, wish I could keep it.",0
3,"It's such a cute dress, but definitely runs small. I was considering getting a bigger size but I didnt like how far the lace goes down the back, too revealing for someone as big as me. I would say this runs 1 size smaller than what you normally are",0
2,"The color is not 'Midnight' as advertised. It is a royal blue. Not enough room inside for a phone, or much else. Money does not lay well in it. And I couldn't return it.",0
3,Good product for price,0
5,"This Las Vegas sun is no joke. It’s seriously way too entirely sunny here and I have tinted windows and still need to have sunglasses on.<br /><br />That being said, I own a bunch of sunglasses. I think they can be a fashion statement plus eye protection and I like to mix it up.<br /><br />Here’s a more detailed review of these glasses.<br />Appearance. These are exactly as pictured on the product page. I picked up the blue with black lenses. The glasses are oversized and have a square finish on the sides.The blue is subtle. It doesn’t scream, hey i’m wearing blue glasses. It’s a hint of blue when you catch the glasses at the right angle.<br />Comfort. I am Asian and my nose bridge is quite a bit smaller or lower than most causasian people so I tend to find glasses slip down my nose a lot. These actually weren’t the case and were very comfortable. The nose pieces fit right at the top of my nose and stayed put as I walked around.<br />Price Point. At 22.99, this is fair and competitively priced considering it comes with a nice case that has a magnetic closure and felt lining.<br /><br />These will definitely end up in my regular rotation this summer.<br /><br />I received these free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",1
1,The material is horrible. Similar to the material reusable shopping bags are made of.,0
1,The jewelry does not stay locked into the pipe. Had this earing about 2 months and the piece has come out 3-4 times. I have been lucky enough to find it each time it's been lost but not this time. It's to bad. I really wanted to like this and get more. I purchased this one specifically because of the description stating it would lock in differently and not keep falling out.,0
5,"Works great, wire inside so you are able to form it however you want.",1
1,This jacket was awful even if it did fit properly. I ordered a xl and it fit like a medium. The jacket was short (like the picture shows) and so skin tight I could not have worn more than a tiny t-shirt under it to get it zipped. The fabric was so shiny and looked like it was made from garbage bags. Even if it fit I would have returned because it looked so cheap.,0
3,A little small and not exactly what I expected but still good.,0
5,Great watch. Easy to read. Perfect size. Very happy with this purchase.,1
5,Loved these pjs,1
5,I read the comments and ordered a size above my usual and it fit well. It is very comfortable and I love it. Great quality!!,1
2,I don't like it.  Cheaply made.  The quality is well below what I expect from Coach.,0
5,"As soon as I got these glasses, I was hopeful.  They are smaller than some styles, I am a small lady.  But, in spite of the price, the frame has hinged ear pieces.  I couldn't believe this.  AND, they are very good progressive lens.  This is amazing.  I live close to a Wilmer clinic in Md., part of Hopkins eye clinic.  And, for years, I have gone there for the routine eye test and new glasses.  Which last time, cost me over $500.  Last time, after the ear piece broke after warranty, and I was told to go to a cheap place to try to get new frames to fit the lens, I priced new glasses.  The two frames I liked were between $550 and $650, and that was a few years ago.  I just wore readers, all over the place, put on take off again!  Lose them.  Etc.<br />Then, I decided to try online progressives.  I didn't have great luck, I found some Preve Reveaux on QVC, which are great lens, but the frames didn't feel great.  Looked great, but tight, inflexible.  Still, cheaper than Wilmer, and the lens were quite effective.<br />These are fantastic, cheaper than the other progressives online, and the transition from reader in bottom of lens, in my case, 2.50, to 0 in top, is as good as anything I have had before!  I love these!  And the hinges are wonderful, making the fit comfortable.  Thanks so much!<br />I read a lot, I am on computer quite a bit, and I switch from reading to distance vision a lot.  Perfect, I can't believe this!",1

3,Ordered XL/XXL and it fit my size 8 friend.,0

5,Granddaughter loved it!,1
1,Broken it was Not like you describe it,0

5,"For reference, I am 5’1” and weigh 130 lbs. and I ordered the medium which fits perfect!  It’s more of a rose color than a pink but I really love the ruffle detail along the edges.  It’s very lightweight so I can layer it with a tank top or a shirt and not worry about getting too hot.<br /><br />The ruffle detail is along the ¾ inch sleeve and the collar.  It’s made with a soft lightweight cotton that moves with you and doesn’t stay stiff like some blazers do.<br /><br />I can wear this with jeans, dress pants, or a skirt…so many options!",1
1,They slip off my feet at every step. I tried to tighten them but that made no difference. Terrible return also. Have to take them to UPS store. No label to print out at home. Could they make it any more inconvenient to return them? I found a way to reverse that return. Started over and clicked on different things and I was able to print out a return label--thank goodness. Made it a lot easier. Good old USPS!,0
3,"It's a one-size-fits-all so the fit was exactly right.  The sleeves however are a bit strange.  (BTW, when you first look at it upon receipt, you'll groan because they look to be cap-sleeves.  Not to worry.)  The fabric is not particular attractive, IMO.",0
4,"Larger than I expected, but very pretty.",1
5,"Awesome fit. I’m 5’9 falls slightly below my ankles, perfect for my vacation. Highly recommend!!!",1
5,Fast delivery. Beautiful fabric and color. Love it!,1
2,"For the first time I'm disappointed.  I thought these earrings would be about one inch in diameter at most.  They are huge.  I donated to the Discovery Shop, charity that sells items and with funds helps cancer victims.",0
2,"I think this shirt is really pretty and I would keep it. The problem is the lining. There's one in the front, but nothing in the back. What's the point of this shirt then? Either line the whole thing so you don't have to wear a cami, or don't line it so you do. Pick one! With the lining in the front I don't even want to wear a cami because then it's too bulky, plus if you want to wear this in the summer you'll get too hot. Just know what you're buying before you buy it.",0
1,"Very poor item quality.<br />Must take caution as material used to make mask tear easily.<br />Not intended for reuse.<br />Nonwashable.<br />Strong chemical smell, must allow mask to ""air out"" prior to use.",0

5,I work in a warehouse where I have to spend time in 34 degrees a few times a day. I wanted a jacket that was warm enough that I didn't have to layer so much and be too warm when I'm in my office. This jacket is SO warm. I'm usually a medium but I bought a large because I didn't want it to be too fitted. I wish I would have bought my regular size because it's pretty big but that's okay. If I was more worried about it being flattering on me I would exchange it but since it's just for work I don't mind. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the hood. When I have it up I can't see that well because the fur is so thick. It doesn't fall off like a lot of hoods do so that may be a plus for you.,1
5,So cute,1
1,The dress reeks of oil. No option to return. Worst purchase ever on Amazon,0
1,This product is very uncomfortable. It pushes everything together but the metal wire underneath makes it imposible to wear anything without it being noticiable. I wish I could return it but I am passed the window for returning. I thought I would keep it to see if it would work with other Outfits and it does not. A waste of money!,0
5,"The watch came just as described and I can tell that it is a real Casio watch. I am in love with it, especially the color. Definitely recommend.",1
5,"Love the color, seem to be made well, very cute, clear lens, fit comfortably & straight. I plan to buy more from the same manufacturer!",1

4,Zipper is hard to close when putting on I can zip it of but can't zip it on. I just slipped the short on,1

3,"Love the fabric of the underwear. It's soft, breathable, and stretchy but the cut of the underwear was not as expected. Firstly they ride lower than other hipster style underwear I use of other brands. The cut along the back is also more ridden up (think slight wedgie) than other hipsters as well, but you can't see the back of the underwear in the pictures. Returned this item.",0
2,Didn’t like it,0
1,"I have plain regular t-shirts that are longer than this. Not only is the length a problem ( which is a serious problem considering what this is labeled as) but the shoulders are weird. It's like, seamed incorrectly or something. I returned mine.<br /><br />The package came promptly however, and the material was soft. Sucks it isn't what it should be.",0
1,Fits any to small. Ordered a size larger and it still didn't fit.  Supposed to be plus size!,0
5,An excellent hat case. I carry over 10 hats with me when I travel so this is just what I needed. There really aren't too many other products out there and this company got this product right! It holds at least 12-16 hats comfortably and keeps them protected!,1
1,"Do not even look at this!! it is not worth, the watch does not even turn on, I have read the instruction, over and over again! I have tried to contact the seller and nothing! I will contact Amazon Customer service now! this is a waste of money!!",0

3,"Got S and fit true to size, i'm 4 or 6 in lulu. Material and quality feels nice.",0
5,"I'm just shocked that there are any reviews below 5 stars. This will be my 3rd time buying these over the years, they are so comfy and perfect.

2,"I would have to say this piece is very pretty, the main reason for my return is that i was unsatisfied with the size of the piece.

5,Fits my son perfectly and keeps his feet dry and warm!,1
1,"The metal must not be surgical steel, I began getting irritation from wearing these.  I also had the rusting issue in the skull that others describe.  I discontinued use and threw away because of how poor they were and what they did to me.",0
1,I have a 25 waist and ordered the smallest size. This was very loose like 3 inches. And long bc it did not sit on the waist. The flare is a lot too,0
1,I hit this and it does not fit on my ear and it does not squish to tighten on your ear I am afraid it will fall off and it has,0
1,The product fits however made very poorly. It is a cheep item and would not withstand a wash.,0
3,I like the dress and it fits nice. Only issue is it's a printed color on a white dress any stretching show white.,0

5,The battery lasts a REALLY long time! I charge my Alto S/M frames over and over again without having to charge the case. Excellent product.,1
5,"These look exactly like the picture. I was concerned that the quality would not be that good, but they are actually very nice, and look great! They have not bothered my ears either, and my ears are a bit sensitive.",1
2,Too small and VERY see through..,0
2,I loved it at first and still wear it around the house. But the neck hole stretched out almost immediately and nothing keeps it on my shoulders so I'm constantly pulling and adjusting it.,0
5,Great product!,1
5,"Bought this for my teen's trip the NYC.  She said it was perfect.  Large enough to carry the essentials, plus phone, travel related paperwork, wipes, wallet, checkbook, etc.  The leather smell was a little strong at first but gradually faded and after a week is not noticeable.  The bag is well made-- nice stitching, sturdy hardware, and front, back, and interior zippers. The strap is sturdy, easily adjustable, and just the right width.  My only complaint is that the lining is too dark and too lightweight. But even that could not reduce the five star rating.  I would highly recommend this bag and plan to buy one for myself.",1
3,"It fits well and I love the design, but the print started to fade after the 3rd wash :(",0

5,"It runs small, need to size up when ordering. Returning item",1
4,"It looks just how it does in the picture! I wish the chain was longer by just another inch so it fit over my head easier, but that's the only thing that I would change about it. It is beautiful! I can't wait to put together an outfit with it!",1
2,So this is suppose to be a 2xl now I fit into an xl and still have room. This hooded “shirt” is so unbelievably tight for the size. The material is very thin and cheap feeling. Never again,0
5,I ordered this necklace because the peridot is my sons birthstone and also one of my favorite colors.  This necklace has exceeded my expectations and then some!  It is beautiful (the chain is a little flimsy but that is to be expected) and I have received so many compliments on this necklace!  It is also a little larger than I expected which was a great surprise for me because I thought it was going to be small and almost unnoticeable.  It is also very comfortable to wear and has not given any skin irritation to my sensitive skin (something I was worried about)  It comes in a velvet box (actually in a wrapper IN the velvet box) so it is also a great gift for a loved one.<br /><br />  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased product review.,1
5,"Less expensive then other brands, but does the job. The description doesn't have the sizing, but I usually wear a size 36 waist, so I original purchased a M/L figuring that would be close. It was a little tight at the waist, but wearable. I purchased the XL/XXL and it is more comfortable.",1
3,The same thing I said above. Great belt . Could you make it longer. Oh by the way I gave the other ones as  a gift. And they love them..<br />Now can you make one or 2  for me. 50&#34; long. If yes send them and I will pay through AMAZON. Thank you.,0

5,Favorite sports bra!!!,1
4,[[ASIN:B01M3O1QZA Miusol Women's Navy Style Stripe Scoop Neck 2/3 Sleeve Casual Swing Dress]]<br />Purchased this dress as an XL. Measurements are 46 38 42. Normally a large in tops and 14 in pants. Due to the stretchy material of the top portion of the dress fit quite well though was a little tight around the waist. Its not something that is unmanageable. I felt if I had ordered this a size up the top half would have been too lose around my bust. I stand at 5'7 and dress fell just below my knees but looked great. Would not recommend wearing a petticoat underneath. Its a very nice dress to wear in cooler weather,1
1,"PJs look cheap! Paid over $12.00, price tag shows 6.87!!",0

2,Turned silver after like a week,0
1,i wear a small or extra small and could not even pull it over my body (I got the large/extra large). I then had to pay 3.40$ for return shipping. Do not order unless you are a child's size,0
1,"The lenses was popped out in the box. I was able to put it back in for a couple wears, but after that it just kept falling out. Plan on only getting 2-3 wears out of these glasses.",0
3,"It's ok. Nothing special. It's very loose and drapey, so if you're looking for that style, I'd say it fits true to size. Size down if you're looking for something more form fitting. It's also longer than I thought, but not quite long enough to wear with leggings (it doesn't cover my bottom and I'm 5'7).",0
1,"The zipper broke on the first night of use, had to leave my huband's company party early. Thank fully I took a jacket with me to cover up.",0
5,Perfect,1
2,I go to a spin class and these tops roll up as I’m riding. I have to constantly pull the top down to keep it from rolling up to my chest exposing my stomach. I purchase a size up to avoid this from happening but nope. Maybe I should have gone 2 sizes up.,0
1,"Thankfully it was only 90 cents.  I should have known.  It doesn't even lay flat, it lays sideways, and you can't turn the chain to fix it.",0

5,Great way to close a wrap or cloak.  Strong.,1
4,Perfect,1
1,"One shirt out of the pack will turn yellowish/cream in the sun.  It looks fine in the house.  When we go outside, it changes.  The threads stay white so it looks very odd.  People noticed.  If these are for a base layer and no one sees it, fine.  But I do not recommend if you want the shirt to be seen.",0
5,"I wear mine all the time! It's softer than I expected and it's really nice! Sometimes I do need to be careful I'm not showing too much cleavage, I'm a 36 DD and it fits great in that area and isn't too tight but can creep down to an uncomfortable level sometimes (especially with my kid always pulling on it.)

3,It's ok but took forever to get to me,0
1,I purchased this and ordered my normal size that I wear and they did not fit. If you order my advice is to order a larger size,0

1,It broke I ended up returning it.,0
3,Over all the bands are nice and work.. but they aren’t the same size as the ones that claw with the watch. Got the small ones and it was good bit bigger than the small band that came with the watch,0
5,"Takes me right to Israel -- so special to me. Very nice, extremely nice... encourages prayer.",1

4,"4 instead of 5 because it's a bit bulky. color is awesome, good features for the price",1
5,This is a nice men's short sleeve polo shirt.  I usually wear a XL or a XXL based on the cut of the shirt.  This one was a XXL.  The fit is nice and I definitely would not go down a size.  The shirt is made of 80% cotton and 20% tencel.  The shirt is well stitched and the 3 buttons are nice looking.  The shirt feels nice on.  Nice polo shirt.,1

3,I got these as a gift for my daughter.  They have not been opened yet to check and see how strong the chain is. They r pretty and the size I expected.,0
1,Gold plating was bubbled up when I opened it.  Would have started peeling right away.  I returned it but I will order again because my grandson really wants it for Christmas,0

5,Perfect fit,1
1,"I was really looking forward to getting these boots for my daughter. As soon as she saw the box, she screamed in excitement. The first thing I saw, however, was how destroyed the box was. It was shipped in a bag. Why wouldn’t it be shipped in a box to protect the shoe box? No big deal, it’s not like we ordered this for the box. We put on the boots and I go to tighten the shoelace and the plastic piece that holds the shoelaces together has been broken off on one of the boots. And I notice some kind of material on the faux fur that is sticky. Needless to say, will be returning this product. I’m very hesitant to order another but my daughter is disappointed that she no longer has her “annaelsa” boots.",0
4,Have tried it in the cold yet but as of right now it is good quality.,1
3,I love this shirt but it will not stay on your body w/o body tape. Even if you wear a bralette or bra you’ll still have to tape it on your shoulders.,0
2,Cheap sunglasses what can you expect.,0
1,I will no longer purchase bags from BHFO the seller is selling 2nd quality bags at low prices & they won't hold up to normal use. They do not like to replace their defective items and want you to contact the manufacturer. Not good business practices.,0
2,They fit like skinny jeans. I even got a size larger and they are still tight.,0
3,It's cute,0
5,Just as pictured. My little one loves her shirts,1
5,Very good product!,1
3,"The fit is a bit tight and the finger lengths.. Too long, I was looking for gloves I can use while driving. These feel authentic, like they are made from genuine leather, however in my case I needed more flexibility and these just didnt do it for me. I really wish they had different sizes. It seems like a great bargain, but it could also be that the price is marked intentionally. Either way, ive felt these gloves in my hands and my honest opinion, they look good, they feel great, even has that leathery smell.... Only downside and the most important is that its not ideal for driving because the fit is tailored for specific hands.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews before making my purchase and the finger length especially for the pinky finger is not exaggerated at all. I would take a picture to show, but unfortunately I returned mine.<br /><br />I wiuld love these gloves because they were inner lining was very comfortable except for the fit of course. These are also beautifully designed. I like the chic look and its so stylish. Its my loss for having been born with short pinkies lol.",0
2,This was way to big. It was way to big and baggy and just looked sloppy. It was made well but not made for me.,0
2,"Cheap material. Top was alright, pants were on the odd side as far as fit goes.",0
4,Our baby boy has some pretty chubby feet so it is difficult to get them in all the way. But our daughter had slender feet and they were awesome easy to put on and stay on!,1
4,"I love the way these fit, while they are baggy they still look good on and didn't seem so wide in the legs which makes a difference. So the material is nice and not see through just the picture you can see the trees etc in them when I got them home they look like that. It wasn't until my son mentioned from a distance they looked like camouflage, then that's all I could see. It's not a big deal and I'm keeping them.<br /><br />I washed and dried them right away and they handled both well. The material does soften up when you wash them.",1
5,This watch strap is very nice.  It is comfortable and waterproof.  The design is well-thought-out and has the band going under the watch itself so the band is against the skin instead of the watch.,1
2,Not very good quality. Too thin.,0
3,"I love this earpiece! it is a solid well-made cuff. Unfortunately, it is too small for my ear so I will be returning.",0
5,"These belts are worth the purchase. Very nice looking & good quality, if your looking for an inexpensive belt made well. This is for you!",1
2,Seriously uncomfortable. Barely any breast support. The straps were the worst! You're better off buying a different shaper. Wish I could return.,0
2,"Loved it, until it broke while dancing the first day i wore it...",0
1,"If you are looking for good quality, not recommended.",0
5,I’m glad it has two pockets as I wear am insulin pump.,1
3,"these socks arrive with a strong chemical sort of smell, so I washed them before I wore them. Smell was gone, they shrunk a bit but nothing crazy. When I wore them they shed black lint all over my feet. That continued until they had been washed at least a dozen times.<br /><br />once i got through that stage they're alright, but in no way great. i don't see them lasting more than a year though.",0
5,Sturdy yet comfortable. Good team graphics.  Pleased.,1
1,Was completely see through. Thickness of a cheap napkin.,0
5,Very cute and has just the right amount of storage for cards. I love the zippered change pocket in the middle.,1
5,Looks like good quality and cute.,1
5,Very happy! bought it twice :),1
5,I liked the length and the color.,1
4,"Definitely a nice shirt for the price, quality material, washes well.",1
5,"I really love this product. My mom (81, sister and I all got one) and it's so fitting for these current times!",1
5,Love it,1
5,Very great product,1
5,Great shipper great product,1
3,I liked the price but didn’t like the thin material it was made of.<br />My daughter needed it for Tennis in the cold months.,0
5,Awesome!,1
3,"From the waist down the dress fits beautifully.  The top is another story. The straps are more than 2 inches too long. The bust is sewn crooked and fits really weird.  I am a size D and the top fits rather big. Very pretty dress though. I am going to try to fix it because I am out of time for my wedding. I think it will look fine in pictures. Also, this dress shows ANY fat you have on your back. I  am buying a shrug to minimize that look. If you order the dress buy a size up and order it in time for alterations.",0
5,"A really gorgeous bag. Soft buttery  off white leather . I love the shape and style. This is my second such bag. I own a  Colgate bag in green too, but this one is super elegant and also very trendy. Excellent seller, highly professional. I highly recommend this bag.",1
4,"I freaking love giraffes. And when I got this wallet in I was estatic. But on the inside of the card slots, there was sticky stuff in it? And the clear plastic for the ID slot is wrinkled. But other than that, this wallet is absolutely gorgeous, the outside texture is soft and feels nice. I hope this lasts awhile, because I'm worried that it might not",1
4,In the pictures it looked more red which is why I ordered it but it is actually a very pink color. Still very pretty.,1
5,Great item- fit as expected. Really great seller. Perfectly shipped and responsive to questions.,1
2,"The hats wouldn't stay on our heads. It shows a little ribbon, but it wasn't enough to keep the hat securely on your head.",0
5,This çostume is gorgeous.  It is not light and flimsy.  It looks so beautiful on.  Was a Halloween costume for my 12 year old daughter.  This would be a great costume for a festival or faire.,1
5,Excellent hat. Extremely soft velour material on the inside. Very happy with this purchase,1
2,"There's a reason why these crash pants are ""hand wash only"" - because they're made cheaply. The material just doesn't stand up to any sort of trauma. It tore itself rubbing against my pants, and that's just through one outing. Also, the rip revealed the actual pad, which appears to be made from the same materials as the swimming kickboards. On top of that, when new, the crash pants SMELL. They smelled like chemicals emitting from the pads. It was honestly impossible to put in my closet without washing them thoroughly to try to get rid of the chemical smell.<br /><br />I bought these because they were made in the USA, but these junk are so bad, they made the made-in-China junk look good. At least the other ones are machine washable, doesn't give you cancer, and is less than half of what these pads demand. Threw mine away, huge disappointment.",0
5,Exactly as advertised.  Good size and color and quality.  Excellent price.,1
1,"The watch face arrived broken, I requested an exchange but have yet to receive it.",0
4,I like the look and the way it feels when I wear it. The only complaint I have is that over time it does start to change colors underneath I guess from sweat and getting wet when washing dishes and stuff like that. The top side is still silver. It’s worth the money and worth buying if your not wearing it every day like I do and keep it from getting wet. If you do that then it’s great.,1
2,Broke within a week,0
5,Love my suitcase,1
4,There were so much glitter! It was everywhere. But the costume fit true to size and was super cute and lightweight. Probably not the best for a cold Halloween night.,1
1,Don't luck like the picture,0
3,"Although this product description stated &#34;Women's&#34; sizing, I think it is more like Juniors sizing.  I generally wear a women's small, so that is what I ordered.  I am 5'5 and 135lbs (pear shaped / B cup).  The shirt was quite a bit shorter than expected (came just below my waistband).  I loved the texture and feel of the shirt and the softness.  A larger size may have made up for the length, but I went ahead and just returned it.",0
5,"Bought this for my gf, she loves it.. could be a little better in terms of durability",1
5,Very good,1
1,Poorly made.,0
4,"YEEPSYS Women's Zip Front Sports Bra<br />This sports bra is comfortable to wear with adequate support for most activities. It features removable pads in the cups (the pads are thicker than I’ve found in other sports bras), cute crossing straps in the back, and a zipper closure with internal clips for added security and to make for easier zipping. The front zipper makes it easy to put on and take off when you're sweaty.<br />It is quite similar to a Tek Gear zip sports bra I purchased about a month ago, with the main difference being the sides of the Yeepsys brand are very high and offer quite a bit more coverage than I’m used to with a sports bra.<br />I ordered a medium, the size sports bra I’ve purchased for years, and I think in this case, I probably would have preferred a small. I’m a 34D and the medium is a little too big.",1
5,Perfect,1
2,My daughter loves the show and she loves the necklace. But it's very cheap and the locket doesn't latch properly. It is NOT worth $50.  I would not purchase again.,0
5,pretty,1
2,"I like the fabric but the skirt is too short. I am not a tall person, I am 5'4'' 127 lb. and ordered a medium. It is fine on the waist but it is way too short for my flamenco class. Was not what I excpected",0
3,sort of too big for my taste,0
3,they are just ok.  Too plastic.,0
3,"Much smaller than I expected. These are fairly  tight-fitting, and very thin material. I ordered large. I am 5’7 and 145 lbs. I look much like a sausage in a large, but I think an XL would have an odd fit do to the cut. For me, they are on the short side, but the arm holes are large, if that makes sense.",0
5,Awesome quality for the price.,1
5,I love this shirt so much!!! I ordered two more colors because I am so in love with the style!,1
5,Boyfriend loves it,1
5,"Love this watch the dome Crystal to the large easy to use crown snap in snap in case back the strap that it comes with from Timex is well for all intents and purposes junk. But easily replaceable with a NATO strap. The fixed stainless steel lugs rather than spring bars is a great feature for durability.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this watch is aside from some differences in number style and the watch face it is almost identical in size shape and feel to the Cabot Watch Company g10. Big benefit to this watch is the price size and durability. I love my g10 but didn't want to abuse it at work this was a perfect compromise. This watch was definitely designed way out of its price point.<br /><br />8 months in update.<br />Still with several other watches this is the one most often on my wrist. It has taken a lickin and kept on tickin. I have no other complaints then, don't expect to use the lume at night to read the watch. It is entirely useless. With that in mind though the rest of the watches comfort, durability, and utilitarian design and function way more then outshine the crappy lume",1
1,Cheap!,0
4,I looked at reviews and decided to order a size smaller and I’m glad I did! I normally wear a Large but ordered a Medium in black. It fits nicely and not snug. The material is stretchy but slightly see through depending on your undergarments. I’m short and it fell right at the top of my knee.,1
5,Love this bracelet.,1
5,I collect watches and i have bought the wife a few but when she got this one she loved how light it was and how it went with a lot of different outfit's and looks very classy,1
5,"This was what I was looking for! I should've gotten a small, because I like my cardigans snug around my arms. Aside from that, this cardigan fit was what I've been looking for. The fabric is nice. I don't know about other people, but I hate looking for cardigans at target, h&m or wherever I can find them and come out empty handed. This cardigan was the closest one after my fav j. Crew one. I will probably purchase other colors!",1
4,"Authentic — silver stamp clearly marked on back of each earring. These earrings are smaller than I anticipated. That said, the level of detail is outstanding. It makes the size dainty and demure though exquisite — like RBG!",1
5,Pretty necklace,1
5,Spectacular watch for the money! I get a happy feeling every time I look at it. And the functions are great and easy to use!,1
4,Exactly what i asked for. Masks light up and look exactly like picture. Plastic is a little flimsy but all in all great buy for the price.,1
1,Crooked. Very poorly made. Cheap materials,0
5,These are lovely. I love that you get a full set of gold and silver. Very well made and sturdy. They are going to make an excellent gift. I can't wait until he opens them.,1
1,The tassel was very frazzled looking and they fell apart almost immediately.,0
1,Should have ordered extra large CYZ. Tight in crouch.,0
5,"I received a lot of compliments. They do pill easily though. I am 5’6, 130 lbs.",1
5,So nice. I love the colors. Feel light and cool. Wear them to the gym and they do help are flexible.,1
1,Very cheap. I ordered xl and I am a size 6. Too tight.,0
1,Very small... Leather is real but poorly crafted... I do not recomend this necklace.,0
2,"This bralette fit me well around the band, the material was nice and breatheable and I like that the straps are adjustable, but this was made for someone with almost no breasts. Incredibly annoying because you’d think as the sizes went up there would also be more room in the cups, but that could not be further from the truth. I am about a 36C. In my opinion this bralette is sized for someone who is a 36A or 36AA. I think it would fit an average-built man better than it would fit most women.",0
3,not bad just thought it would be a little higher quality.,0
2,"I would’ve given them 1 star but heck, I shouldn’t expect too much considering the price. Let’s just say, “you get what you pay for:(“",0
5,Love these pants. Very comfortable. Fast shipping.,1
5,"Gardened for 30 years, best hat ever!!! Bendable brim, can shape however you want. Will definitely purchase again...FANTASTIC!",1
5,Awesome!!!,1
1,No water resistant at all,0
5,"My daughter is very particular about the feel of materials on her skin; these are perfect for her. She says the are her favorite! If you have battles about the way your babie's undergarments fit, these are worth the investment!",1
1,hate this! I couldn't put my case on with it and it did not stick well.,0
1,Purse does not have Coach name on it? Not sure if it’s real!,0
3,"The quality was good with this. The ties felt nice and silky. They were of a nice thickness. They came in a nice (not spectacular) box so they would be good to gift. We were very pleased with the quality.<br /><br />They darker tie was very nice. It was a pretty color. I thought it was very versatile. It had a nice sheen to it. My husband liked it a lot and it would also be nice as a gift.<br /><br />The problem was the other tie. It had the stripes, which I expected. I did not expect it to be sparkly. Literally sparkly. So it would be good for Christmas, perhaps, but both my husband and dad took one look and said they couldn't wear that. It really seemed to push into novelty. So I wish that was a little more of a standard tie.<br /><br />Overall great quality, just know what you are getting.",0
3,I thought this ring was very pretty and I love roses. It is really a very cheap ring and looks like a child's ring. I would not recommend it for an adult.,0
1,"This is the second Summer Mae swimsuit I purchased,  Both same styling, both same size,  couldn't even pull this up past my knees.  Embarrasing!",0
5,Love this sleek and handy hook! My purse is safe from dirty floors or grimey ground.  Super easy to move among my purses and excited to try with my heavy tennis bag.  May need to get a few more!,1
2,"Be aware that not all of these dresses are made of the same thickness of cotton. This dress's fabric was much thinner that others in the same design, from the same vendor, in the same order.",0
5,"Cheap stand in wedding ring, since we spent enough on the wedding itself. It is thin, but I have short hands, so it looks great.",1
3,Cute but too narrow,0
1,"Not very comfortable, and not working at all.",0
1,"I ordered the white one and it smells terrible!  I don't know if it's the paint or the chemicals used to tan the leather, or what.  I put it in my garage to let the odor dissipate, but it has been more than 10 days now and it is still awful!  I don't know if I'll be able to wear the belt because of the strong odor.",0
5,"These are well made and overall really cute! I gave one as a gift and my friend loved it! I just wish they were slightly larger for the price but, I'm still happy with this purchase!",1
3,The purse is heavier than I thought it would be.  And the shoulder strap broke at the metal part. I ended up not using it.,0
4,"i got a medium and it does run kind of small, but the shirt is super cute and it still fits pretty well. i ordered a medium and i am 5'6&#34;, 120 pounds. it comes down to my jean line and is not super loose or baggy but not too tight or uncomfortable. i can definitely wear this with like a cute skirt and tuck it in or just jeans!",1
2,"This top runs very, very small. I am 5'6""  and 165 lbs.  The largest size available lacked about 10"" coming together to attempt to zip.  The top also had a very strong chemical smell.  Had to return.",0
1,it fell apart the first day!,0
3,It's okay.,0
3,Okay not great. Takes a minute to get the speakers where you want them. Good if your not doing any loud activities other wise the sound gets muffled out compared to having earphone directly in your ear canal. Probably be great for running or shoveling snow.,0
5,Love love love this.,1
3,"I bought these boots in a size 7, and I usually wear a 6. They fit perfectly around my feet, but I feel like they taper a little too much around the ankles and calves, and they just don't look very flattering. I don't have very big calves and I feel like these boots just make my legs look thicker than they actually are because they are so tight around the ankle. These boots would be much cuter if the ankle part was not so skinny.",0
1,"These were terrible.... I don't know who's belly button is this long. But when I went to cut/adjust it to fit my belly button, the ends wouldn't screw back on.  Flawed design, waste of money.",0
3,Gift from my children! It’s cute.,0
5,Soft with a great fit.,1
5,very nice shirt,1
1,Cute but very cheaply made. I wasn’t able to put my prescription on them as they are very poor quality,0
3,"It's a pretty ring but the metal is thin and bends very easily. Given this, not sure how well it will hold up over time.",0
5,Nice product. Well made.,1
5,Luv it,1
1,Finish cracked after one week of normal wear,0
1,Really cheap flimsy material.  Has a metal hinge in the side which doesn't show in pictures. And pictures show a more solid stiffer mask. Not happy with it. But you get what you pay for.,0
1,"My wife got on here and ordered this shirt. When I saw it I asked, ""Who got in my account and ordered this shirt"". She confessed. It came, I didn't even see it, and it went to the thrift store. It was ordered as 3X and it was way too small. The material she likened to sandpaper. What more can I say?",0
3,"Cute, warm, and as pictured but it small for the size.",0
4,"This is a really nice hat if it fits you. It's too shallow for me so it doesn't go down far enough on my head, and it's only just big enough around to fit. That's my problem, not the manufacturer's fault, but maybe that information is useful to someone. My head is about 23.5"" around, if that helps. In my experience with dark cotton ""military"" caps, they show white sweat stains if you do outdoorsy stuff in them, then they shrink if you even spray them with water. So if you plan to sweat it in then you probably want to get a bigger size if you can.<br /><br />The cap looks really sharp. The brim is short which I love. The fabric is a brushed fancy weave that's super soft but was already covered in lint by the time I received it. I've had a hat like that before and it was just always covered in lint. Not a problem in a heather gray, but it looks bad on black cotton. You have to brush it a lot. But it does look really nice. It's a heavy cotton (and it's black, obviously) so it probably isn't best for really hot weather.<br /><br />I wish it fit better because I really like it, even if I have to lint roll it.",1
4,My girlfriend is very happy with them. Now I'm looking for a matching bracelet. They are a good price and look great.,1
3,"The white leopard design looks so cute online, but in person it's a little deformed/misshapen/uneven. My toddler still loves it and it seems warm, so it's not a complete bust - but I would expect higher quality at this price point.",0
3,Low quality and very small.,0
2,It was not the right fit. It runs small. Cute but I didn’t like the fit. Will go up a size.,0
2,The design and material are nice but could not get the wrinkles out after 2 washings.<br />The color is more lilac<br />and dull definitaly not purple.,0
5,i really like this shirt- i wish it came in other colors.,1
5,"The fabric is so beautiful.  It has a lovely sheen and drape.  I am 5'8&#34; tall and the length is perfect for me.  My measurements are 39B/37W/41H and I ordered the XL and had no fit issues at all.  I saw they also carry this in short sleeves, which I would prefer, but they didn't currently have my size in this color, on the hunt now for the perfect shrug to match.",1
1,"THEY LOOK BIGGER, HOWEVER THEY WERE TOO SMALL.",0
5,Love it,1
4,"very good quality for the price... I used for my sons Steampunk costume, spiffed it up a bit...I added a leather band,some gadgets, feather and steampunk glasses and it looked awesome! Also he has a pretty large head and thick hair so it fit perfect.... small headed people might need to add a little cushion on the inside....",1
4,"Not much to say.  I haven't used it, but it's very pretty and will be perfect over my suit",1
1,Better buy at Walmart.,0
5,Perfect quality.,1
5,"I LOVE this watch. For $25 ? A BARGAIN. Looks expensive, feels expensive but isn't expensive. Luckily I read a review on the setting of date (pull crown out 1/2 way ) from a prior review. Because it does have no instructions.<br />I love it",1
2,They are not as detailed as the picture. Pretty disappointing.,0
5,Pretty color and doesn’t get caught on anything!,1

4,It can fit my purses. I like it!,1

3,Good looking. But too big. From nose to chin. Made for a huge man's size face I'm thinking. Wldnt buy again due to this.,0

5,"These pants have a nice thick, breathable, and flexible nylon material making them suitable for hot summer or springtime wear. They also have a waistband that comes up above the waistline to help hide that pesky baby fat. One thing to note is that my girlfriend, seen in the photo, is only 120lbs and has a slim body yet these leggings fit her tight despite being a large size. So I would say they run small.",1
1,The winder did not work at all. We have now returned it.,0

5,It is good quality and fit to myself,1
1,"Super pequeño, para una niña",0
1,"I ordered a small and medium in these pants and they were both too tight in the hips/butt. I have some curves but am a pretty average shape, 125lbs. Normally a medium would swallow me but these were too straight through the hips. Both pair went back, boo.",0

3,"not the same size, other than that is very good",0
5,"My family and I just started watching Schitt's Creek a few months ago and we are in love with the show and the cast. This was a funny episode that definitely sticks with a person, so it's fun having a shirt that reminds me of it.<br /><br />Let's talk about this shirt. It's made well and feels like a high quality graphic tee. The graphic itself is secure and not too stiff. The shirt is soft and comfortable to wear. The size is probably just about right. I usually wear a medium/large (size 10 in most things). I got an XL just because I wanted it to be roomy, and it is perfectly roomy, but doesn't make me feel dumpy.<br /><br />Seriously cute!",1

1,"the seams ripped right away :( so cute, but poor quality",0
3,"The feel is this leather is nice, but the whole reason I bought this wallet over something that was a quarter the price was because it claimed to be thinner than other wallets. If it lasts 10 years, it will be worth it, but otherwise it was overpriced.",0
3,"I currently have a pair of swimming shorts from this brand, and I really love them.  We took them to the beach and I had no issues with them being uncomfortable or being too thin.  These ones seem very thin and with the color I am worried they will be see through when wet.  I will still try them out when the weather changes (will update).  They also just feel to fit a little differently than my other pair.",0

1,"I ordered these glasses and they arrived on time. They are very cute and fun to wear. I got several compliments on them.  HOWEVER, I wore them for less than a month and they broke.  I only kept them in the case when they weren't being worn and I pretty much only wore them for driving so they didn't get a lot of use.  However, after about 3 weeks of wearing them, the plastic broke where the screw was near the bridge of the nose on both sides. They are now completely useless and a waste of money.",0
