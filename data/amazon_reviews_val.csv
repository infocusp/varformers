1,"I would not order again. It has a very bad chemical odor. It was pretty, but the smell is horrible!",0
1,The material was thin and cheap.,0
5,Beautiful and well made.,1
5,none,1
2,"Arrived on time but would not recommend.  üò£ fabric very light, I like heavier.",0
3,"This is indeed a very strange wig, it comes smushed inside a narrow cardbox, as soon as you take it out it doesn't look at all like in the picture. You need to invest some time combing it and giving it shape for it to be somewhat close to a 50s hairdo. Once you go through the process it will look OK, but I still think I could have done a better job with my own hair. Unless you are bald or short-haired, I wouldn't recommend this wig, combing your own hair will look way better and natural",0
4,too long,1
3,"I love the cut, but the fabric is very thin and of cheap quality.  It‚Äôs supposed to be line dried, but dries in a mass of wrinkles.  I do not typically iron a knit dress, but it‚Äôs really necessary here.  Even compared to the thinnest Lula Roe fabric, it‚Äôs thinner than that.  You definitely need carefully selected undergarments with this dress.  I would never wear without thick leggings.",0
5,This product is very well made. Soft to the touch and amazing. Definitely will be buying more.,1
2,"It fits perfect, but everyone can see everything, the fabric is so transparent =(, so I cannot wear it.<br /><br />But looks gorgeous.  So trans-lucid  T.T",0
5,"Very nice chain, just the right lenghth.",1
2,Doesn‚Äôt really stay on my wrist because Magnet doesn‚Äôt stay connected. Ended up purchasing a different band. Don‚Äôt recommend.,0
1,Came broken sent them back,0
5,"I love all of these! They're comfy, cozy, and fluffy, all while looking super cute! The sole is thicker making them great for hardwood floors and slip-safe.<br />However, I am glad I listened to the other reviews saying size up. I'm a size 6.5 normally and I ordered a size 7 based on suggestions and I must say I'm glad I did. Half a size up was definitely necessary since 7 was an exact fit for me. They do open up and stretch just a bit after a while but definitely size up by like half a size. Other than that super duper happy with them and wear them in the house all day!",1
3,I liked the various stones and styles of this set and that‚Äôs the main reason I ordered it. They came nicely packaged in a blue bag and each ring was in its own plastic pouch. Only issues i have is that they seem pretty cheaply made and I‚Äôm nervous the gems will fall out since they are only held on by four thin prongs. They are your classic belly button rings and definitely do that job for a fair price!,0
1,Too short waisted,0
5,"Very, very nice.",1
3,"I have purchased several of these shirts in the past and they are great. However, the last one I ordered had a pulled thread on the bottom causing it make the shirt loose.",0
3,"not a generous fit, harder to breath through than a knit",0
5,"Breathable, and nice looking.",1
5,"Great item, I even found earrings, a necklace and Connections by Hallmark charm that match it.",1
1,Underwire? In a swimsuit? You've got to be kidding...,0
5,birthday gift,1
1,This looks like a good idea. 3 seals in case one fails there are others as backups. But it still leaks.<br /><br />I was only snorkeling on the surface of the ocean. So the bag only experienced a water depth or 2 or 3 feet. When I got back to shore I found my wallet and phone were soaked.,0
4,"These are quite the bargain for FR pants, the only issue I have with them is the fabric is quite rough and chaffed my skin in places that I wasn't used to .<br />The quality of these seems to be very good and they should last quite well.",1
4,It fits a little tight and is somewhat sheer but super sexy on my curves. This is my 2nd pair...different color,1
5,VERY GOOD,1
5,originally got it to go with my Halloween costume but i cant stop wearing it! i get so many complements and it's genuinely gorgeous!,1
1,cheap product like MADE IN CHINA,0
1,Worse quality I‚Äôve ever seen-could have bought these at Dollar General,0
5,"I wear this everywhere and because I have curly fluffy hair, it can be lifted off my neck, with or without a tie, and when I use it without a ponytail, my hair doesn't poof out over my ears. I used a headband over the bill to keep my ears warm during an Alaskan fishing trip. I will doubtless have a design appliqued to the front. Just my favorite hat.",1
3,"Nice shirt, but I had to return it because the size ran a little too small. Tried buying it again in another size but it looks like it's no longer for sale. Oh well.",0
5,"Nice product, I like the fitment",1
4,A bit large but ok,1
5,Cute dress!,1
3,"Item runs very big. It's made for a tall person. I'm 5'10"" and this shirt looks like a nightgown in me. VeryThin material. Hope it shrinks in the Washer. Very nice Logo.",0
5,I can‚Äôt wait until my baby girl can fit this! I think I‚Äôm gonna kick it with MOM today,1
4,"Very pretty, but too big for my taste. Will be returning.",1
2,"The fit is good and is comfortable. I liked the way it looked when I recieved it. However, after only two weeks, the bronze pattern has worn off from a significant part of the band.",0
1,Material not good,0
1,"Felt comfortable, but the stitching is falling apart already.",0
3,Because it‚Äôs only magnet and there‚Äôs no loop or anything to secure the band I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this‚Ä¶ I lost it once when taking off my jacket luckily I found it but when the magnets are pulled they come apart and the watch detaches from the wrist,0
3,"The length of the shorts are a bit too long and they have the look of clown short for my taste. They could be shorter for better look. Still comfortable, stretchy  and cool fabric. But clownish style shorts still",0
5,Great glasses you will like them.,1
1,These were not tights. They were very thin stocking which had holes in both legs when I unwrapped. I was desperate and wore them but by the end of the party I had runs up and down from holes. Don't waste your money on these.,0
5,"This coat is rather nice, if WAY too small.  The outside feels like a wool blend, and the liner is silky.  It seems to be made fairly well, and looks very similar to the picture.  It is very cute, but I can't wear it.  I ordered it 2 sizes too large (I am just over 5'4&#34; and weigh about 160lbs) at a 2X Large, but once it finally arrived (it took over about a month to get here) I was heartbroken to find I can't wear it.  It is much too small. It was designed for a woman much more narrow across the shoulders and much smaller in the chest (I am a 36 DD).  While I can get the coat on, I can't close it over my chest, and I worry that if I reach for something too quickly I will split the back.  I will be giving this oh-so-cute-but-much-too-small coat to my little sister, hopefully she is petite enough to use it.",1
2,even thow theres size options i dont think there actually is different sizes for these theyre waaaay to small for an xl,0
4,Bought as a birthday gift she loves it,1
5,üëè fit  LOVE the pockets!,1
5,"Love, Love this band. So comfortable and secure and easy to adjust.  A little tricky getting it on the watch but it's worth the work. The lavender is beautiful.",1
5,Good quality,1
5,Very cute and well made,1
1,Look cheap.,0
3,Returned as the bras run way to small in the size chart indicated. Was very disappointed.,0
5,Excellent materials. Resistance.,1
3,"The color is bright & pretty for a mask, but it's huge & the ear loops come out too far.  For an average-sized adult-female face it doesn't seal securely enough around the face to be protective.",0
5,Lovely!,1
3,"Nice shirt, but not a ""tee"". Soft and shiny silky material. Not what I expected, more of a ""shirt"" than ""tee"".",0
2,"I am always between sizes M & L and I ordered a L this time. It‚Äôs way too big. The fabric is cheap, shiny and thick. It‚Äôs a cute design, but I don‚Äôt think I can get past the fabric.",0
3,Looks like it runs a size smaller. Comfortable though.,0
1,Not put together good at all my kid would have done better job ...way too small ! I am a 100 lb women.,0
5,I ordered a size oppsmall. I am 5'7&#34; and 120lbs. This size small fits me well. Not too tight at all. A little breathing room. The dress is comfortable and the material is really nice! It feels silky smooth and the blue color is beautiful.,1
1,DID NOT FIT AT ALL,0
3,"I read the sellers remarks to other Vine people giving bad reviews about these necklaces and explaining how they can't guarantee the names being sent. I personally don't understand how since there are dozens of them shown in Vine and each one in different names. I believe the name is also in the description we see when we request an item. Anyway, I requested ""Bethany"" and got ""Rose"" instead. Obviously I couldn't use it since the name was wrong, but I will say that the necklace and tag are actually quite impressive for this type of jewelry. Had I gotten the correct name, I would have been much happier. I can state though that the item is very well made and would make a great gift.",0
5,"Cute, very light weight dress.",1
2,"Fits as expected for length, cheap plastic costume jewelry. The company sent it to me through Amazon with a cannot return clause apparently. Never used it since it looked so cheap. Guess I'll give it to my niece to play with.",0
1,Felt like I was wrapping myself with an Ace Bandage. I wrapped myself. Then my Hubby wrapped me. And I looked nothing like the picture and didn't feel comfortable. Adding a wrap 101 video might of been helpful.,0
1,"Not made for plus size, I am a size 20 and the pants shredded in rear and between thighs on first wear. Had to leave work to change.",0
5,"Like the color shirt. Not greay, or purple,it‚Äôs an in between color. Got it as a gift for a nephew who loves The game. He didn‚Äôt have this shirt",1
4,"Bought it for my son‚Äôs neon themed dance at school.<br />As far as quality, don‚Äôt expect it to last longer than the event in which you purchased it for. Upon arrival we had to do some alterations for it to stay in place. However, for the fun factor, it is definitely a hit. Great effects and unique. You will stand out.",1
2,No help at night.  Would not buy again,0
4,Just to tight.,1
4,"Love the purse, fits iPhone 6+, wallet, and chapstick.  Had to give only 4 stars bc top zipper sticks frequently, unfortunately.  I use this purse every day.",1
5,Great fit! So comfortable! So cute! Love these!,1
1,I was ordered red color and y received white earrings.. üò£üò£üò£,0
3,did not fit with my case,0
1,pretty,0
3,I love the dress but with my built 5'2&#34; and 108lbs the small I ordered is too large for me. Should have gotten an XS. Or I got to gain more weight. Haha! The dress itself isn't bad though.,0
5,This dress fits like a glove. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 so the length is perfect for me. I‚Äôve brought other midi dresses and they barely came over my knees. I love this dress so much I brought another in black and will probably go back for blue,1
5,gorgous bag!,1
4,I love it.  The only set back is that it changed color with my sweat. :-(,1
4,Super cute. Wish they would have came in individual bags for storage,1
2,"I really loved this light pink color but when I received it it was hot pink - a color I wouldn't have ordered. I feel it's inconsiderate of the company to switch colors without asking. I would've returned it but it's too much of an inconvenience. Also, my almost 5 year old girl has an average size head and this was really tight on her and it didn't cover any of her face as the picture might lead one to believe. I would not order from this company again.",0
2,They were too small and the button hole wasn't there... like they forgot or something. I returned them and got a refund. They might have been cute though??,0
1,Not anti-fog I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again,0
1,See through and very very long. Disappointed because the color is so cute.,0
5,"Made for a man, but used by a woman. Before viewing this item, it never really crossed my mind that men might have a need for such a thing. Obviously, you can can tell that I'm not a runner. I got these for those situations where wearing a bra is not needed, too much trouble, not possible, etc. I'm incredibly self conscious that my girls might give a heads up about the weather or just decide to wake up all on their own. I like these because I can simply put them on and then discard them afterward. They are large enough to cover the entire space so that even if the top is tighter, you can't tell that you are wearing these. They adhere well and haven't been irritating at all and I have very sensitive skin. I have never experienced nipple chafing but I'm gathering that it is a very uncomfortable and painful experience. So glad to know that these exist so that I can share this information as needed. This is a huge value with 50 pairs. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1
1,Turned after 1 week,0
1,"El estampado es de muy mala calidad, esto no parece una camisa de calidad",0
1,I normally wear a medium but when it comes to dresses I do a large because my legs are 75% of my height! I decided to be extra careful with this dress and get an extra large! Well it fits like a medium I wanted this dress for a funeral this weekend so it was kind of a quick decision to buy but still not cheap for it to not even fit!! Don‚Äôt waste your money,0
5,Exactly as described,1
3,This was a cute costume but ran very small,0
5,"Love this bracelet ... very elegant and eye-catching.  I have small wrists and it fits fine. The only issue is the way the back is finished, it tends to poke into my inner wrist when I use my keyboard.  So, I just wear it when going out and get lots of compliments :)",1
2,I was excited to do my nails until I opened the powders. The solid colors are fine. The powder is really fine. The sparkle ones are not. I have to crush it up before I can use it. And I don't think I will be able to make it as fine as it should be. Disappointing.,0
4,"The seller didn't put a size on this listing, so I took a chance. (I needed some new clothes for vacation!) The shirt is very nice, great material, etc. But the size is a little small. It would help to include the size as stated on the label. Measurements would be helpful too.",1
3,"Not bad, but doesn't look as good In Real Life as the picture here. My main complaint is the rubber pinbacks fell off, lost, and now I'm digging through old pins trying to find proper metal ones that will stay on.<br />Would not buy again.",0
2,"waistband too tight. ordered 1 size larger, still way too tight.",0
5,"purchased this ring for ring finger.... suits it very well; delicate looking, comfortable and pretty... love all my rings from Gem Avenue ....  great purchases in pretty packages :-)",1
2,Terrible quality. The seams started opening up after one wash.,0
4,"Love this shirt, but it does run a tad small. I'm a size 12 and ordered a Large, it barely fits. I like my shirts a little bit looser. It is really pretty though, and the color depicted is accurate.",1
5,This suit is awesome. Fits perfectly,1
5,"This wallet is vey well made and comes to you as described in the literature. Great value for the money, and I would definitely recommend buying one!",1
2,"The zipper is a really bad plastic and the buttons didn‚Äôt line up, also it started to tear a whole in the pocket pretty fast",0
2,"Did not like ,look s cheap",0
5,Goid,1
3,Cute shirt; but if you have a larger bust size it lays weird on your chest.,0
1,Fell apart peice by peice in public...it was so embarrassing...no thank you..,0
2,Hated the way it looks.  It wasn't long enough!,0
5,:),1
5,I liked the simplicity of the install to my existing watch.  Its also very durable and easy to remove/put on. Looks good enough in a business setting as well.,1
5,"Absolutely love it! Just like the photo, adjustable straps helps a lot because I have a small face",1
2,"I‚Äôve bought this set before in different colors, but this particular one was too small.",0
1,Sizing is way off. I ordered a 10/11 which should be a large in girls. It fit my four year old! It was more of an x small. Cute dress I kept it but we warned sizing may be off.,0
1,Too small and bunchy at the bottom. Ended up returning the top.,0
5,Exacto,1
2,They are cute but do not hold liners !,0
3,"Since the band turned out to be too big for my watch, any watch, I didn't get a chance to use it.  Didn't think about the band being too wide for the watches I have.  Live and learn.",0
4,"It‚Äôs a bit small on the top half. I wear a large or size 12-14. The arm holes are chest area are a bit snug. Good, thick fabric. Pretty dress!",1
1,His belt is so small it should be noted for children I wear a size 6 and cannot wear this,0
5,love them so cute,1
5,"I chose the basketball theme, and they went over great with my 13 year old grandson. He is wearing them every day!",1
5,Bella,1
5,Very pleased. .,1
1,"My picture actually does it some justice.  This is horrible.  Like someone's ,600lb+,faded , washout,  homeless,  cheap scrub with wings from a garbage can. Nothing like the pic.",0
5,I loved how it fit and how thick and good quality the fabric was,1
5,"Great full metal quality, feel like $200 sunglasses. Highly recommend",1
3,These are flat not three dimensional just FYI.,0
5,Ordered a pair of these cool shades for my son/in-law who is a boat owner and continues to loose his shades.  He loved them and wears them 24-7.  Haven‚Äôt lost them yet!!,1
2,Looks like a prisoner.,0
4,"This scarf fell apart very quickly, even in a gentle wash. But it looks pretty cool even while strings are hanging out and holes are evident.",1
5,"I bought these a size larger than recommended because others I've bought have shrunk after being wet multiple times.  These work just fine.  Still easy to take on and off, good grip.  I use them for surf fishing and so far they have deflected a few fish spines successfully and prevented one cut.  (Note: deflecting the spines only works if the spines come in at an angle.  If they are perpendicular it is still puncture city, ouch! )",1
4,Cool and great for casual wear,1
5,Can't go wrong ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,1
5,Just what I wanted !,1
5,Daughter liked it.,1
5,"I ordered the wrong size & it fit exactly as expected (FOR BEING THE WRONG SIZE). It was too small. :-) BUT despite my mistake, I take nothing away from the corset. It is so strong & well-made. It is the highest quality corset I have ever owned (& I have bought over a dozen in the last couple of years). I missed the window for exchanging it & I do not have any of the packaging material any more. I am in the process of ordering a larger size (one size larger). I will keep the smaller one for when I waist-train myself into it.",1
2,Fits small & I wear a size 7. Holes in ties in no time.,0
3,should check the sizing chart..large seems to fit medium,0
3,"We all know a lot of stuff on here (especially the cheap stuff!) is made in Asia and the sizing is off. I already have a 40th birthday shirt but thought I'd pick this up while getting a friend a similar one. I wanted to order an oversized tee to tie at the bottom and roll the sleeves. I can wear medium or large depending on the style/cut but figured I'd need a large for this. I ordered XXL for my oversizing goals. It fits like a standard large. Not long enough and barely enough fabric to knot. When I did so (as small as possible), the shirt was at least two inches above my belly button (too short for my XXL expectation). Sleeves not overly long but could do two small folds. The XXL is fine and comfy if I wanted a basic L-fitting tee to wear normally.",0
2,Very cheap product the material deteriats easily and will not actually keep your head warm,0
5,"A terrific travel scarf that looks as good as it functions: it's versatile, soft, and it can be used as a plane pillow, compress, rifle sling, or any number of other functions other than the fact that it keeps you cool in hot climates and warm in cold temperatures",1
5,Very cute,1
2,[[VIDEOID:fa850d4111416566c7de1766bf8706cc]] Looks embroidered and thick.  In actuality it is very thin like pajamas.,0
1,Very poor quality and unconfortable,0
1,This coat was way too long on my two year old. It hit his knees and the sleeves were extremely long. It fit my 5.5 year old and I purchased a 2-3t! The 2T fits more like a 5T. Sizing is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt know any child with an average torso and arms to his knees. Fabric layer on the outside is super thin. I can see it tearing up very easily. The pro is that it is pretty warm. Definitely not the right coat for us. I am in the process of returning. I will keep you all posted with how that goes since this product was sold by a third party.,0
5,It‚Äôs like 4 or 5 different dresses in one. At first it seemed kinda like a thick material and I thought I would be too hot in it but once I actually wore it a couple times then I wish I could wear it every day it‚Äôs so comfortable!,1
5,"I found this top to be true to size. I am usually a US 16 and take an XL or XXL in a top, depending on the style and brand, and in this, I ordered an XXL and it fit great and was just roomy enough. The great thing about this top is that the buttons are functional, so you can alter the tie in the front to your torso length. I decided I wanted to wear this with a high-waist maxi skirt on a date, so I unbuttoned some of the bottoms on the bottom, then tied, and it looked cute! The waffle-like material is comfortable and although it's not particularly hot, I feel like this wouldn't be something I wore outside in the HEAT. I just feel like it wouldn't breathe properly, so take that into account. The material quality isn't bad, though! I would buy this top again in a different color for sure!",1
4,My wife loved the sturrup,1
5,"I like everything about this Handbag, it looks so elegant.",1
5,it made my wife smile.,1
2,This is NOT a sweatsuit. It is a thin outfit. Ran too small had to give it away.,0
5,Bought for my grandson and it fit him to a tee!! He looked so cute in it.,1
5,"Great goggles. I got these for my 9 year old. Shipped fast with Prime. Did come with cleaning cloth, earplugs and nose thing my son is using them 2-3 times per week. They are stored in the case after they dry out. Great price too!",1
4,It is a beautiful skirt. I love the pockets! The skirt I received did not come with a belt.,1
5,My new favorite Harley T!! Great fit. Great price.,1
5,"So cute! My 6 year old daughter wore these for our wedding 2 weekends ago. She is obsessed with them and now ask to wear them daily.<br />PS: they do not rub the back of her heel, which is a HUGE PLUS!",1
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money.,0
1,Frame came completely shattered with glass shards everywhere. Very dangerous. I'm extremely disappointed.,0
1,Dislike the product is cheap the plastic is very thin and the label you put on it stuck to it and there is no strap to keep it close poor quality for the money i payed not happy.üòû,0
1,Returned,0
5,It's very light weight compared to other compression shirts I've worn yet it does it's job just as well,1
2,MUY SIMPLE PUES  Y ESTABA QUEBRADO,0
5,Nice quality!,1
5,Love it,1
1,"I gave it one star because the design is gorgeous. I got the gray and it‚Äôs gray unlike what other say about being lavender. However, I also ordered 3 sizes up from my normal size of a xl to a 4x and can barely get it over my chest after reading reviews. I have had it with the China sizing. A 4x should fit 3 of me and I can‚Äôt even get it on. I normally wear a Xl in tops and 14/16 in pants. 38 D chest why is a 4 x so small???",0
5,"Comfortable, lightweight and great price.",1
3,Tight across the belly.  Fits my big &#34;girls&#34; well.,0
2,Fabric is rather stiff so it doesn‚Äôt have a flowy look. More like a petticoat.,0
5,x-mas gift,1
5,"Bought these for my boyfriend's birthday this year and they were a huge success! They're a nice pair of classic looking aviators. The tint is nice and dark, and the metal frame looks sleek against the black lenses. Pay attention to the size. They're larger than I would have expected them to be, which makes them great for my boyfriend, but makes me look like a kid trying on my parent's clothes. Guess I'm not stealing these for myself after all!",1
3,"The pajamas are not bad but watch your sizing chart. I am 5'0"" and 140 pounds. I normally wear a medium in USA sizing. But these are Asian sizes. I ordered an XL in this and they JUST fit me! In fact they are a bit tight in the thighs and the stomach but I can wear them. I just hope they don't shrink too much. The material is nice and silky. But do not buy unless you are a smaller person. I truly would say no more than 150 pounds maximum. Order 2+ sizes up.",0
2,Very fitted - like two sizes too small fitted.  Great shirt otherwise.  Lightweight.,0
5,Excellent,1
1,This product has snaps on the side and top of the hat.  However the top snap is pretty useless.  The ones on the side do not give a good fit and the plastic is flimsy and hard to see through.  I definitely do not recommend this product.,0
4,"This generously-sized scarf is wonderful for the winter, offering moderate warmth with enough fabric to wrap many different ways. There are definitely warmer scarves out there with thicker, more insulating fabric, but this one is decent for moderately cold weather, especially if you have the right clothing on. My only critique is that it is a little bit itchy, in spite of its softness.",1
5,"The feel of the product, not the sticky normal plastic",1
5,They're great,1
4,"Loveeee this dress, the neck part is a tad tight for you to put your head in but it worked, other than that it‚Äôs a really cute dress.<br />Wore it for date night ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
4,Did not get the free N95 mask as stated in the description.,1
1,couldn't wear the dress was so tight I nearly ripped it,0
5,I looooooovvveee it,1
5,This is so soft! My son has only had a few uses of it so far but seems to keep him very warm and has held up well being washed,1
5,Muy buen producto excelente lo que yo quer√≠a muy contento,1
4,"I love PajamaGrams.  They are quality sleepwear.  A little pricey, but worth it.  So glad Amazon carries them now since the PajamaGram website charges outrageous shipping.",1
5,"I had been looking for a phone pouch for my iPhone X for so long ! I can fit that, lipgloss, cards and some light cash all in this little thing. Not to mention it gives sailor moon vibes! It‚Äôs super cute true to color and goes with almost anything I wear! Great buy as well!",1
5,Very pretty!,1
5,Product is very beautiful and high quality.,1
3,"HARD to rate. There was nothing wrong with the ordered item as far as I know, but it did not meet my expectations, because I ordered the wrong Item. It would have been for some other Beretta, not the one I have.<br />I modified it so it does the job as I could not, in good faith, return it.<br /><br />Charles",0
3,Looks like a hospital gown,0
3,"This is cute, but it‚Äôs pretty short. I have somewhat of a long torso and it comes up above my hips. Not sure if I‚Äôm keeping it yet.",0
3,The quality of the tank is great and it‚Äôs super cute but it runs small. I usually wear medium/large and this felt like a small.,0
3,"Small for a XXL, but as expected. I wanted more room.",0
3,"Item is cute, the buttons on the bottom are cheaply made and to stay clipped.",0
1,Well dosen't light up not sure if I wanna reorder or get something else,0
3,Definitely has a cheap feel to it.,0
5,I love these bands I just wish they had a different variety of colors in them,1
3,"Nice look and fit, but unfortunately one had a big cut in the visor.",0
3,These face masks do the job but they stretch out easy and more appropriate for a man's face,0
5,"Really liked these, fabric, size, length...just to bum around the house in. Wound up purchasing almost all colors, long and short sleeve, and may buy a few more.",1
5,"I received this hoodie as a gift from Hockey Santa.  All the other hockey parents are jealous, as they freeze their asses off at the rink every week.  It‚Äôs so cozy, I‚Äôm almost too warm!!!",1
5,Ok,1
1,This is a very thin stretch almost a light spandex material.  I returned because I wanted a sweatshirt.,0
5,Excellent,1
3,"This skirt is very small, and the fabric is rough to the touch. It is cute though.",0
1,"arrived broken, had to return. cant imagine these would have held up well if they are easily broken during shipping.",0
2,"The shorts on this pajama are cut small and although they fit, they are a very skimpy medium and not comfortable for sleeping.  This is in contrast to the top which is sized as expected.  The material is OK but not of the quality that I had hoped for.",0
1,I'll be sending them back. They arrived with loose stones and in the light the black stones look green. It's unfortunate because I really liked the style.,0
5,Wife wears medium shirts so I got this in a medium for her birthday. Fit perfectly.  Seems to be good quality. Wife really likes it.,1
5,Sorta small but good enough to rave in or wear underneath a shirt. If you have bigger boobs I'd get maybe one size larger.,1
5,Fits perfectly. Looks good on my feet. I got a lot of compliments on them.  They go right with my jeans.,1
3,It is pretty but very light. I like it but I am afraid it wont support its own weight on a chain.,0
4,Some flowers fell off but a very nice product. Great for my 20 week maturnity photo shoot.,1
3,"These slippers felt good when I first put them on. After wearing them the short time (less than two months) that I have had them, they are fitting sloppily. Sad to see this happen as I wear slippers everyday.",0
1,These socks are awful quality. They are suppose to be for men but don't even fit a womens size 6.5.,0
2,"Arrived undamaged, on time, and well-packaged.<br />Fits great everywhere: around shoulders and across chest is smooth, relaxed around waist, drapes nicely at hips and thighs. Lands around 2-3 inches above knees. The dress is well-sewn and the color is as expected (a deep red).<br /><br />The problem for me is the gaping at the lower part of the armholes. There is at least an inch which can be folded over, it is flappy. I will need to cut an inverted triangle and sew it up to wear. As stated, the fit across chest and shoulders is smooth and form-fitting (not body contouring, but certainly not loose), and this is why the extra material is surprising.<br />5‚Äô4‚Äù, 100lbs, 30D-24-35",0
3,Love coat but too tight ( large was very big on me) there was also whole in left pocket! I have Michael kor jacket very similar cut large fits me perfectly. ? How this could be??,0
2,don't really like this piece. Looks really cheap in person.  I did not pay very much for it but just don't like it.  Would have returned it if it had cost more.  I'm just going to donate it.,0
3,"had to resize to fit, but other wise ok",0
2,Not good in quality.,0
3,They are a little tighter than expected but still good,0
5,It arrived safely and its so beautiful! I believe my little sister will love it this Christmas! :),1
1,"Looks better in the picture, the stones are not put on well, crooked, uneven,  and not even sparkly at all, good for kids playing dress up that's about it.",0
3,Really pretty but way off in size!,0
1,Pretty and good fit but literally turned to silver within a week or 2. It‚Äôs cheap and is cute for the money just know it won‚Äôt be rose gold for long,0
3,To small,0
1,Terrible quality. Six out of the 12 earrings came broken.,0
2,"Two stars for being pretty, but no more because the design is completely flawed.<br /><br />Whoever designed this forgot that the Vivoactive HR has a built in 3-axis magnetic compass, which is vital for the navigation to work, as well as things like the compass widget. The magnet clip, that holds this wrist band together, is strong enough to make the compass swivel around like crazy.<br /><br />Returning this.",0
5,I am so happy that with this dress. It fit me so nicely.  I am kind of hard to fit in dresses. Top heavy and short. Size 16 most of the time. Fabric was nice too.,1
1,"Super thin, does not stay up well.",0
1,Es una estafa por que yo las pague y aun no las eh recivido,0
3,"Overall the blouse fit, however the arms were extremely tight for the size.  I don't have big arms.  I was also disappointed the blouse had a dark spotted stain right out of the package. It looked a lot nicer in the pics, than it was in real life.",0
1,"Sleeves are a little short as at least one other has reported.<br />But I could not believe that this all WHITE garment came with a BLACK zipper!  Not at all with, what would make sense, a white zipper as shown in the product picture.<br />I will return it and not order again unless the vendor can GUARANTEE a WHITE zipper, as shown.",0
5,"cute shoes, my daughter loves them.  One of hte little green lines on the bottom did fall off within about a month but nothing more since.",1
1,These are awful and do not sit flush against your nose. Although size is nice they poke out and even fall out.,0
2,This dress looks good but once you try it on you begin to see it doesn‚Äôt fit as expected. The waist rides above your waist line and there are no belt loops for the belt. Overall it was an uncomfortable fit for me.,0
5,I love this dress.  It is beautiful and comfortable.  It is a light weight fabric and is going to help me stay cool.  I bought it for a summer wedding.  It is going to be perfect!,1
1,Cheap af,0
5,Perfect,1
5,"I‚Äôm in love with this shirt! Very flattering, covers what it needs to cover, does not cling to your stomach, flows well in front but doesn‚Äôt make you look like your pregnant lol. Makes you look slimmer. I‚Äôm wearing an extra large. I could have fit in a Large but I wanted it loses in front. And it fit perfect!  I‚Äôm a 38D about 182lbs and 5‚Äô3. I just wish it came in more colors. I got the Brown and the black . I will be buying the long sleeve in black too! Please make more colors! Definitely recommend!",1
1,Didn't look as nice as in the picture. Looks really cheap and a bit cheesy.,0
2,"These shoes are cute, but they are not comfortable.  Feet kept sliding, inserted foot pads, but didn't make a difference.",0
5,"These arrived really quick, came with a nice little carrying bag.  They are a little tight to put on but are very comfortable after.  Very nice product and they feel pretty sturdy.",1
2,The top doesn't fit correctly as if it is irregular..the bottom fits fine.,0
4,Nice.,1
5,I have a long-distance friend and I wanted to give her something she could take with her daily. This pin was the best option and she loved it! It came to her in perfect condition. Thank you!,1
5,"Matching colors online can be a crap shoot, but this is pretty true to its actual color. It looks really nice.",1
3,"I wore this once, but it just felt cheap so I gave it away shortly after.",0
1,"These shoes are horrible, the shoes fit different and are inconsistently made. Cheap labor allows them to make this type of product",0
3,"It looks nice at a glance but the edges are a little poorly made. Although it hasn‚Äôt yet, it feels like it might come undone.",0
3,The shoes is excellent except the part that goes across the top of your foot and you can‚Äôt really size up,0
5,"The mask is well made, attractive and very comfortable.  It probably offers SPF sun protection because I  held it up to intense light and none came through.  I purchased several colors and couldn't be happier.",1
3,This is beyond a crop top.  It is more like a bra because it‚Äôs so short.  I was very upset when I tried it on because the sleeves looked awesome and it was super soft material.,0
1,Thumbs down. Material is cheap and see through. Was nice to refund payment but comes from overseas.,0
5,looks fantastic in hair for prom night,1
5,Was a great buy. It worked perfect for the person who looses their phone alot,1
1,The shoe is falling apart and I have only worn them 3 times. The suede is falling off the boot,0
5,Beautiful dress a little tricky to get in and off but hands down for the money great dress quality was amazing was very impressed was upset to have to send it back because my daughter didn‚Äôt like the lace over her shoulders touching her arms she just pulled and messed with it u could tel she was uncomfortable,1
3,Great people to deal with order the right size too small order the size bigger still too small so my behalf to go at three size but they had no problem with returns,0
5,Just the right amount of sparkle at an amazing price. I was going on a cruise and wanted nice but inexpensive jewelry... you know... just in case and this fit the bill perfectly.,1
3,It‚Äôs rolls really bad and I felt like I was always pulling it down.,0
2,"- Did not fit as expected. Ordered a size medium which was extremely large. Beware.<br /><br />+ Length was fine for me at 5'8&#34;<br /><br />+ Fabric was soft<br /><br />- Extremely wide around the waist which was not flattering with the striped pattern. For my body type, this could have been a maternity dress.<br /><br />+ seller was quick to respond and my item was returned succesfully without hassle",0
4,"I got the one with the blue liner.  The fabric is just as I expected, light and breathable.  I am 6'1&#34; and just at 300lbs and the 3xl fits fine in the arms , shoulders, and around the body. It is however a bit shorter at the waist in proportion to it's other dimensions.  The hood is enormous.  I can pull the front of the hood well below my chin without stretching the material.  Great lightweight jacket, I just wish it was about 3 inches longer in the body.",1
5,It was Soft and comfortable. The stripes pattern was cute on my daughter. She put it on immediately and was very pleased,1
2,It was not the right size I was looking for. It was a gift and used for money however it is so stiff not much money fits in it.,0
1,QUALITY WAS VERY POOR NOT HAPPY,0
2,"The necklace is beautiful,but broke within a week.",0
1,uncomfortable,0
1,I ordered 3 plain solid hats. All of them came embroidered with an American flag and say ‚ÄòUSA‚Äô. The colours aren‚Äôt even as advertised,0
4,Good to go,1
3,"Cute style, but did NOT like the polyester material!",0
3,Bigger than I expected,0
3,These are very thin and when you try to take them apart some of them crack,0
4,Love how this sock hugs the foot!,1
2,"This bra is pretty to look at but is not a conventional ""bra"" it goes over the head and has no front or back clasp to get on or off. This makes for a not so fun experience, I was not expecting a sport's bra aesthetic. I am usually a fan of longline bras and I do like the bra once it is on. It is just not at all what I expected.",0
5,Nice outgoing dress.,1
4,It is comfortable but the material sits weird on the sides,1
5,NICE PRODUCT.  HAS CUTE BACK POCKETS,1
3,The shirts were cute but to small in the breast section,0
1,It broke when I first got it not good quality at all it is Where is the money do not buy this it is a  Rope off do not buy at all and don‚Äôt waste your time on it,0
2,Sweater swallows me. Fabric is scratchy.,0
5,Love the band just wish there were more variety,1
1,It took two months to receive.  The sleeves are way too short and ridiculously puffy.  The fabric is cheap. I‚Äôm returning this!,0
4,Feels great wearing them and helps suck my waist in a bit. Color (white with design) is see through ish and thin. Quality is good and I feel comfortable stretching in them. Recommend!  delivered quick and safely.,1
5,Excellent top that seems to show off all of my wife's amazing curves. High quality material and customer service is great. I have bought 5 tops for my wife from PattyBoutik and she always loves the fit.,1
5,Nice quality,1
3,"Cheap quality, but also cheap to buy. It's good to own these glasses if you lose glasses frequently.",0
5,"I used the size chart included with the dress photos- The dress itself is more generously sized than the chart suggests.  My waist is 27 or 28"", not 26 as the chart says.<br /><br />I had to put a very small tacking stitch where the two sides overlap so that there was no gaping.  You may need to do the same, depending on the size of your bust.  The chart says 33"" but I wear a 30E or 32dd bra and found the size perfect but gappy.<br /><br />very light weight, cute pattern, semi see through. I wear dresses with leggings due to the nature of my job so the thin fabric is not an issue.",1
4,They are waterproof to an extent. Snow and rain will eventually get gloves soaking wet. 2 or 3 pairs when you buy is smart to always have a dry pair,1
5,Love this coat!,1
4,runs small so I order one size up,1
3,I am a server and struggle to fine a good Pair of pants that fit professionally and that are durable enough for squatting and bending. I thought I had finally found a pair after i received these. The fit was was amazing they have belt loops for us curvy girls who struggle to find something that accentuates the booty but fits the hips. They are kinda high waisted to hide the muffin and they are straight legged. They have the perfect balance of stretch and compression. I was literally in love with these pants until I washed them for the third time and they started falling apart.,0
5,Wore to work,1
2,Very small,0
5,"Gorgeous bag, high quality vegan leather. I am in LOVE with this brand.",1
2,They were inexpensive and they feel like it and probably look like it too,0
5,"This watch was great for the price and even though it was scheduled to arrive in 20 days, it took half the time. I live in New Jersey. Yes it is QUITE large BUT you can cut the band on either side to size and the plastic clasps on each side slide off and right back on. If you look at the pictures, the band has ridges that slide securely in place. Pretty smart design, at least by cutting it, it doesn't leave any awkward excess band like usual wristwear. There are no instructions but it's so simple. It has one button. You press it once to interact, you hold it to indicate you want to make changes. Then press the button to scroll through the numbers. Once you're done scrolling to the correct number, hold the button to continue to the next field. First it asks the hour which wraps around to either AM or PM. Then hold the button to change the minutes. Hold again to get to Year which is indicated as &#34;Y&#34; then hold again to get to month and date. Hope this helps.",1
4,"First time using a ratchet belt and I love the ease of use and comfort of them. I do HVAC work, so there are lots of bending and kneeling. At times, I can feel the ratchet unclick(?) a couple times, but it's really a non issue. It's certainly better than the old fashioned belts.",1
4,Good,1
5,Product came packaged nicely and has hold up nicely to sturdiness!<br />Do not recommend if you currently have kittens who scratch at things though! Mine has a small scratch in it and with the material there's no way to fix it.<br />But that it my fault and NOT the company's! Company did greay.,1
3,good,0
1,"It looked fine and worked well for 3 days.  On day 4 the pin with the crystal on the end popped out of the primer pocket, and the crystal fell off shortly after.  I'll probably de-activate an unfired primer and then seat it in the pocket after soldering the pin in place.  I do not recommend this product.",0
5,"Slim design perfect for under jacket wear; adjustable, comfortable; metal hooks durable.",1
5,"Had to replace my last one that was just old and stretched out. This one fits just right, snug but flexible.",1
3,these are beautiful but break REALLY EASY. You get what you pay for and this product is a prime example. I bought three and all three only lasted five days of normal wear.,0
5,Great tutu for my fun run!  So many compliments.  The quality was very good and it hand washed beautifully. Color was rich and it was well lined.,1
2,"Yeah. NO. I'll keep them to wear UNDER stuff, but these are definitely not one size fits all. And see through as all heck.",0
3,"It's not a bad shirt, just not as comfortable as I wanted and is slightly see through.",0
3,Jut OK - top is kind of stiff.  The cushion sole is soft.,0
4,"Bought these when Costco stopped stocking their version and my last pair wore out.<br />Four stars for value; three for quality. They don't fit my particular frames perfectly, but it's good enough. I was able to put a little bend in the center piece that improves the fit a bit. I did snap one of the lenses out when taking them off once, but I was able to replace it and the problem hasn't repeated. They're actually fairly dark, and do the job pretty well.",1
5,"Awesome shirts, beautiful quality, highly recommend. We bought thing 1- thing 9 for a &#34;twin&#34; day at school, they were awesome. The parents were thrilled and they are priced just right for the quality and they arrive on time despite an email saying they might be delayed do to a storm",1
2,"I wear a size 14 and bought these sandals for casual, warm weather.  Although the length of the ""shoe"" is correct, the straps would fit around a large bologna sausage...they are way too loose to fit; correspondingly, they fly off my feet as I walk.",0
5,Quality of the shirt is really good but its little small for my size (220lbs fit body type),1
5,Perfect for my 4 year old,1
3,"Colors were as pictured, shape as expected.  Upon inspection, noticed hole and fabric pull.  Waiting to hear from Amazon if they want it shipped back or discount it for me to keep",0
1,I bought this a couple months back but mt baby is just now grown into this size. The shoe is really cute but extremely slippery. I had no idea it was going to be this slippery so I put this on my baby and put her down and walked away and she slipped and fell backwards hitting her head on the floor.  I thought maybe that was an error on her part and after she calmed down I made her hold my hand and walk and she was slipping all over so I will not be using this. I really wanted this to work since it matches a lot of her outfits.  Disappointed!,0
4,good support,1
5,Love the bag.,1
5,I am 5.3 and 150 lbs. I ordered large and it is perfect<br />I was worried  it will be poor quality but its not. It is a great jacket,1
1,The gaiters are very thin and would add no protection to use as a mask. They are very loose and do not stay up. Waste of money,0
5,This was the cutest onesie that my son bought his neice,1
3,"Great quality but runs smaller than expected, and I have a child who is very small for their age.",0
1,My girfriend is medium size but this Large size product is stil very tied for her,0
1,Beware - This bra has the same cup size regardless of the size you order. My XXL and XL came with an A or small B cup size. I normally wear a 38 to 40 D cup bra size. I ordered an XL and a XXL to see which fit better. I took the bra out of the package and thought I had bought a training bra it was so small. It was ridiculous and not at all what was described.,0
3,"It was too small to slouch on your head, it's kind of tight.",0
5,"If you need to toss on a formal outfit, this is a great addition to your attire.  I needed a white maxi skirt and blouse.  It was for a installation which we were all to wear white!  Thank you so much for an answer to my hopes and prayers.  The skirt is just beautiful.",1
3,"Sweater is nice and fits well. Unfortunately, there is a hole under the left armpit. It'll take forever and a half to get a new one.",0
5,I've gotten so many compliments on this bag. It des have a weird smell on the inside but it's fading over time.,1
3,"The DragonFlies are beautiful, however the chain was awful.  It broke within the first week.  I would recommend this however to someone that will go buy a real chain...",0
5,"Love these - I own about 12 pairs.<br />Wash & dry inside out, use fabric softener & the won't pill. They've lasted me for a year w no holes or pilling! Just treat w care. These are my favorite!",1
3,Should have ordered the high waisted pair to cover my problem area. They are nice.. but my fault for taking a gamble on these.,0
1,One star because they're made out of bamboo and that's it. They broke after one day. Wish I had a picture for y'all but they were so trash my girlfriend already threw them out,0
3,Runs small and tight. Very itchy.<br />Color and look we're great but had to return,0
2,"Actually in love with the fit/feel of these leggings! Sadly, the seam on my inner thigh ripped the second day I wore them. ‚òπÔ∏è",0
1,Dont waste your money! This ring is so.....thin. The picture makes it look way....thicker than it really is. It is pretty but not worth it at all!!! So disappointed!!!,0
3,"The dress is much longer and larger than expected. Was sure to return it, but it may look better with a belt. The quality is not great, loose threads need to be cut.",0
1,Cut very small and material is very heavy,0
5,"Beautiful, looks better than my pendant that's solid gold, very pretty touch to any outfit",1
5,Really nice and sturdy...the color is nice too!,1
5,Perfect! All the goodness of a regular bandana but stretchy and breathable. Lots of great color options. 100% recommend,1
5,"I ordered the women‚Äôs bands. I am a size 6.5 so I ordered the 6.5-7, great fit and the bands are exactly as they look in the picture. I am very pleased overall.",1
2,"They look good for an event, but are kind of big and difficult to breathe with.",0
1,Looks nice but poor quality.  The seam of the underlay er began to split within the first 15 minutes of wear. It ripped about 8 inches over the course of that first (and only) wear.  Because of the grain of the silky fabric I doubt restitching will hold.,0
2,I kept these but they are very small and narrow. They are constricting and are so narrow they cut off the circulation to my legs.,0
5,Product works well.,1
1,Very beautiful watch but it's not working. Might need a new battery... very disappointed.,0
5,"I like it, the band is not as substantial as I would have preferred, but the watch itself is quite striking.",1
5,I love it!!!<br />I want all of them!!!,1
1,They did not work for me.,0
2,Looks like decent tanks for the money. However very disappointed that two of the three shirts were thrown in the box wrinkled and opened and only one was sealed. It looks like they were returned by someone else. Offer said new shirts not returned or open box shirts.,0
1,Not as expected,0
1,I am a size 8 and ordered the biggest size. It is SOOOOOO tiny. Would fit a child.,0
3,Beautiful but small. Even smaller after washing. Great for petite woman or older child.,0
1,Bad,0
3,Uglier than crocs. Only reason giving 3 stars is because they‚Äôre very comfortable.,0
3,Runs small.,0
5,Good color. Nice material,1
3,"My wife has a pendant with Baguette diamonds. I thought these would be good for occasional wear with her pendant, but they were disappointing. The baguettes are recessed inside the silver frame and don't show much fire. For $20 I didn't expect much but these didn't live up to expectations. Giving it 3 stars because they do appear to be well made",0
4,"Purchased for a long flight, it was comfy and stylish .",1
5,I put them on my chromebook and they are adorable....a little too pricey though. They are very cute and stick very good!!!,1
5,"Great for traveling!!! Exactly what I needed to keep organized!!!! Last thing anyone needs is searching around for passport or boarding passes, with this you know everything that is important for traveling is all in one spot!",1
4,It is a good fit on my 6‚Äô2‚Äù hubby. The only thing I would change is the thickness. It‚Äôs not really thin but could be a little thicker or heavier duty. Otherwise I am sure we will get our monies worth out of it.,1
5,"This is a great watch with Seiko‚Äôs world renowned quality.  Beautiful vintage design with gold case and strap buckle, slightly distressed brown leather band, and crisp white face with Roman numerals.  The beauty continues  in the details, such as a slightly domed anti-reflective crystal, gold outlined date window, textured setting stem and and blued hands.  The world time and alarm functions are simple to use and functional.  The only negative is the watch is a little difficult to set and the process could be explained a little better in the manual.  Overall this is a great value and looks much more expensive than it is.  High class watch with a fashion watch price tag.",1
2,The golden borders are not as well defined as on the picture,0
5,"Love, love this dress! It fits really nicely, is light for summer, and the pockets are a huge bonus. Mine is working great as a maternity dress due to the high waist. The length is great for me as a busy mom of a toddler too - not too short! And the red color is bright and pretty.",1
5, ,1
1,Very cheap. Slow delivery. Doesn't work.,0
5,Good quality.,1
2,"I was certain once I ordered this T-shirt that men would be powerless to resist me. Cats are stealthy, graceful, and mysterious. I was under the impression that once I donned this post-modernist masterpiece, that men would associate me with those qualities. Sadly that has not been the case. However, even though men don't stare at my breasts (as hoped), I noticed that cats do, so at least I am getting some attention.",0
1,"I bought this jacket for my fianc√©, gave it to him for Christmas. He loved it. We are now on February 2 and the jacket will not turn on even with a full charged battery. My return option expired on January 31 so what now???",0
5,"I bought this pin because it reminds me of me and my son. It looks great on brown, beige and denim.  I get compliments everytime I wear it.",1
5,The Nurse Mates compression socks have helped immensely. My ankles feel a lot better than before and I love the pattern.,1
1,Cheap. I wore it once snd when I was taking it off it broke in half. It‚Äôs made of the cheapest metal... I don‚Äôt even know what it is.,0
1,"One star because:<br />1) I purchased the turquoise specifically for the color, and as you can see, it‚Äôs just a light blue blah color.<br />2) The cut is completely different from the seller‚Äôs photos. It is not at all drappy with a low v neckline. It‚Äôs boxy and unattractive. I question if it‚Äôs really 92% cotton. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it.<br /><br />I‚Äôll keep it for a gardening shirt, but I would definitely not buy again and it is absolutely not what it was purported to be. üëé",0
2,The pendant was smaller than I expected and was returned.,0
5,"[[VIDEOID:a857e20e2d0ac09fc18c0b24e31507f2]] I got my order today and I wore one of the outfits to the gym. It was comfortable, stylish, and held up well during my workout. I say outfits, but I purchased the tops separately from the bottoms I do wish they were sold together. My only con for now is that I wish the pants had a pocket on each side instead of one. Other than that I highly recommend these items. I purchased the gray, navy blue, and black cropped hoodie and the matching pants, I got my pants in a XL, but got my hoodies in a 2XL only because I‚Äôm busty and I wanted to make sure it fit comfortably. I will be buying more in different colors very soon!",1

5,Fit perfectly and is very comfortable. Can't wait to wear it on a cool evening.,1
5,"I expected to get the product in a couple weeks but it actually came in a couple of days! Product is as described. Doesn't fit as securely as I would like,but definitely gets the job done.",1
1,It was supposed to be a 3 pack only 1 came,0
1,The watch face is 1.5 inches in diameter. It's almost as wide as my entire wrist. Good thing it was cheap. Not even worth the shipping charge to return it so straight to goodwill.,0
5,"These are the coolest pajamas I have even though I have some with shorter shorts and matching short-sleeved top. The fabric is the secret, very light-weight and breathable yet silky. If you need good-looking PJs that are ultra-cool at night, you've found the right ones.",1
5,I loved it & the fit!,1
3,"I put on the watch and it was too big so I decided to take off one of the latches to make it smaller. The latches are extremely difficult to open. Good thing it was too big and I could slide it off my hand...if not, I would probably still have it on.",0
2,Short chain barley goes around the neck and rubbed off finish in one day of wear..,0
1,"The ""screw on"" backs .. I can't get one of them off.<br />The other one, once I got it off would not screw back on.",0
1,Typo. Should say ‚Äúfirst‚Äù but says ‚Äúfirsy‚Äù. Requested replacement and it said the same!!,0
5,Perfect size and quality!,1
3,"Purchased for spin bike. Thinner material is nice, they feel like underwear so you can wear under workout clothes comfortably. Padding is not super thick and doesn't really go far enough to the front for me but fine for shorter rides. Washes well, pattern\ color is as shown, bought my usual size and they fit as expected.",0
5,"Not too big, but great quality. Also not too small. It work great to make hangover kits for the bride tribe!",1
1,"I find the sole to be very thin and not at all comfortable, even for a slipper. I can only wear them for a couple of hours around the house before my feet start to ache. They are akin to the cheapest shoe sole you've ever seen. The fuzzy/plush bits are constantly falling out and shedding all over my house.",0
1,"I have bought many products on Amazon and this is the worst.<br />1. Hats are full of pungent chemical odors. I think you'll suffocate if you wear it all day.<br />2. It's a piece of rubbish. A material like paper. It's too small. It's more like a hat for a child. But even the children did not like it<br />3. The seller is a liar because the color doesn't match the picture and everything doesn't match what they say. Garbage, garbage, garbage! ! !",0
5,I really like the handkerchief  The Claddagh is just perfect.  I gave this to a friend for her birthday.  She loved it!,1
5,"This is my favorite blouse at the moment, so unfortunately I wear it a lot. After six months use I have to wear it with a camisole, as it stretches quite thin and you can see undergarments through it. If they start making this in a sturdier, thicker fabric I will order more.",1
5,This tutu is ridiculously cute! I got it for my daughter's Halloween costume but I'm sure she's going to be wearing it around for months to come. It seems to be pretty good quality and the elastic is great so I'm sure it fits a wide variety of body sizes. It is somewhat see through in the light but it isn't a deal breaker for me personally.,1
5,"This is a gorgeous piece. It looks exactly like the picture, save for the variation in the veins of reddish-brown the bottom two stones. The chain is the perfect length. I'm not a fan of gold, so I plan to give it as a gift. Still, I love the stones, and would love to know what they are. I want to say the top stone is amazonite, which is one of my favorites.",1
5,Nice looking. It fits well with my fingers,1
3,Too flimsy to stay in my head.,0
5,This necklace is pretty. Looks really nice if you have a longer neck.. I gave it to a friend and it looks great on her!,1
5,"I bought this as teachers appreciation gift. Good quality, bigger than expected.",1
5,They were great good quality and love them all,1
2,Zippers were all defective. Lining bunches up.,0
1,Not comfortable.,0
5,great product; super follow-up by seller; concern with customer satisfaction; excellent value and  would recommend to others without reserve,1
5,"Soft, warm, nice fit",1
4,These work great but I wish they were of better quality. I would be willing to pay a little more for better materials and quality.,1
4,Feels NICE!,1
1,Cheap looking,0
5,Love these. Great quality and I get the most compliments!,1
2,"The quality of this product is terrible. The seams are coming apart all over. The string to tie it isn't coming out of the other side. It's really short! I'm only 4'11"" and it doesn't quite go to my ankles. The hoops are adjustable or removable so I'm rigging it up so I can use it because it does hold my dress out so I don't step on it. I had to sew ribbon on to tie it up and I'm thinking about using duct tape around the hoops to make sure they don't rip out...",0
1,The attachment is not secure enough. Comes undone easily.,0
4,Very pretty but very delicate. The glass is thin. I dropped it and it broke.,1
5,It is beautiful but just to heavy. Sending it back.,1
1,I will never buy clothes from Amazon again I‚Äôd take a pic of it on my kid but I can‚Äôt even put it on her. It‚Äôs massive on her.... I‚Äôm donating it .,0
5,I bought this for my friends daughter for her birthday and it fits really cute very good quality very very cute dress I will definitely buy from this company again,1
1,"For the money it was cheaply made, very dissatisfied with quality.  Save your money and do not buy this.",0
1,It arrived broken at the base.  Cracked off,0
3,"I liked the dress. It fit well, the material was nice and it wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. The bottom was a little too small for the skirt. Unfortunately, I wore the dress once and a seam ripped.",0
5,I love how this ring catches the light,1
3,"decent product, but they tend to bag out and lose their shape/fit after a short time.",0
5,"Looks nice, very roomy and perfect size to store underneath seat on plane. The battery works perfectly. I love all the compartments the bag has, it's the perfect carry on bag!",1
5,"Needed a bag to travel nothing too big nothing small either. This bag seems perfect so I bought it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-lots of room  and lots of compartments<br />-seems well made and took a beating during my recent trip<br />-help up well and sticteches didnt come loose or tears of any kind<br />-zipper are strong and well made<br /><br />Cons:<br />-none at this time, will update in the future if issues arise<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of the backpack. I might use it for camping one of these days. Has outside loops to hang a lot of things on.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful pleas hit the helpful button. It let's me know my review was some help to you.",1
5,GREAT BARGAIN! LOVE THE WATCH!,1
1,Flimsy material and broke very soon after wearing.,0
5,awesome.. i love it,1
1,Look like clown shoes,0
5,Very adorable dress. Ordered the 2T/3T and it fits my 2yrs perfect.,1
4,"These are super easy to paint and decorate, but have a hard time staying on your head. They‚Äôre so too heavy they tend to slide forward or back- definitely need to be secured. But good quality!",1
5,"Great shoe! My son has big feet and was feeling down he couldn't tie his own shoes, we'll get there but for now we have enough these:)",1
2,"I really liked this product and it looked great. However, I can't enjoy it anymore because it fell off my keys somewhere and my house key is gone. I thought about putting it on a regular key ring but I couldn't get one on it. I wish I could get my money back since I no longer have the product and my house key but I can't get a refund without ""returning"" the item.",0
1,"This shirt is ginormous and has a really weird cut to it. The back is much longer than the front. I am planning to alter it so that the hemline is the same all the way around, but I just haven't gotten around to it. Had I known the style and sizing ahead of time, I would never have bought it. My advice: take a pass.",0
3,"Although this item feels great and the rich color is striking, it isn‚Äôt true to size. I usually wear a Lg. I‚Äôm almost 5.8‚Äù with a long torso. I ordered a Lg and an XL, and both sizes failed to fit. The Lg was too small and too short. The XL was too big and far too long, dragging the floor. But‚Ä¶I think if you‚Äôre 5.6‚Äù or shorter, you‚Äôll LOVE this jumpsuit. It does show all cellulite in your butt so u‚Äôll need some sort of girdle to smooth out butt lumps. Really wished it was true to size because it‚Äôs a beautiful jumpsuit.",0
4,"A birthday present for my mother and she's pleased with them. A warning if you have longer or thicker ear lobes they may be hard to get in or a tight fit, not in a hurting way but the lobe area is on the smaller side.",1
4,"The way this watch was photographed I didn't see the circle of crystals surrounding the dial (they are really bright). Purchased this for my son. The flashing lights are amazing and multi-colored (and they don't blink constantly). The quality of the watch is fine, but it is clearly for a female even though masculine in style. For the price it was a great deal and the proprietor is most anxious to please the customer. Would have given a 5 star review for quality and customer service had it not been for that detail. A very handsome and useful watch otherwise. I probably didn't read the details in my haste to purchase it at a bargain price. Would be an excellent purchase for a girl/woman who likes to bike/walk/run after dusk. I'd use it myself but my son likes to play with the flashing light feature.",1
5,Perfect for our project,1
4,"I was wanting a more modest dress for spring and summer, and this one is just about perfect. The three quarter length sleeves are nice for sun protection or a chilly a/c, and the hem hits me just below my knees. The fabric is light and of decent quality, and it irons or steams well. I'm 5' 8"" tall with a 34"" bust and bought a size small. It fits a little loosely but with the belt tied it has a cute boho vibe. The only issue I have is that the elastic in the sleeves is a little tight on my arms, but overall it's really cute and comfy for summer.",1
1,one pair was fake,0
3,They fit waaaay big,0
3,I though the chain was included so it caught me off guard. But otherwise it is an ok pendent. The price was right,0
5,"Very, very cute and comfortable slipper that can be worn as a sandal outside. It looks like a cushy sandal.",1
1,There is no size.  What size is it?,0
1,"This shirt has so much potential.  Super cute design, and unbelievable price.  Well...you get what you pay for.  The fabric is a polyester that is not agreeable with my skin...too bad, because this shirt, as I said, is really cute.  I did heed the other reviews and ordered a size up, to ensure it would fit, but no need - I won't be wearing this.<br /><br />Make this shirt in another fabric, and I would wear it, no question!  Too bad for me.",0
5,Nice pants,1
2,The blue is actually purple. Like Vikings purple. Not happy with the color at all!,0
5,Really cute bag!,1
4,"Nicely made, thick and sturdy but too big for my hands!",1
1,"I got a rash from this sweater, even after washing it a second time! I thought I had become allergic to something else but finally realized the rash happens every time I wear this awful thing!!!",0
5,Just as described,1
3,"I had ordered silver shoes, however they were defective, so I returned the bag as well!",0
1,so cheap I want to return them asap!,0
3,Nice stretching fabric but not loose at all. Definitely snug fitting. I liked the length too,0
1,Does not look like the picture. The studding on the collar is bright yellow gold makes it look cheap. I didn't even try it on before returning it.,0
5,Love these socks!  Cute pattern.  Wool even in summer keeps my feet feeling cooler.  Will be getting more.  Quick shipping too.,1
5,"The chain is really long, but the pendent is nice. The recipient of this gift lived it upon first sight.",1
5,"These are great! I love them for their material use (no known to the state of CA to cause cancer etc.), their foldability, the bright colors, price, the performance, and the convenient storage bag. Theyre a little more sturdy than our first brand from a local safety store.  I ordered a second pair of these a week later.  I will be keeping at least one pair in our car, as one of our sons--while not considered special needs--has issues with loud sounds.  We were caught without our earmuffs at some kind of event, and we regretted it immediately!  This foldable pair with travel bag make it great to keep in the car.  My only concern to other parents is that they're very tight (to create a good seal) to open and place on head. I could see this being a problem for children who need to be able to put them on themselves if they have any physical difficulties.<br />*Oh, I also wore these myself for most of the night once when the 4 of us were in the same room at a cottage. I wake up to the sounds of my kids moving around on their bed/pack n play! They were a little uncomfortably tight to wear for sleeping, but I actually fell asleep with them!",1
1,"way to big, and the style did not look good on me",0
4,Took a bit to arrive but ok quality,1
2,"I wanted to like this. But the fit is just not like shown in the picture. It fits just slightly larger than expected, but not too much. The bottom is not tapered but straight, and shorter than shown, so that it looks very boxy and almost square like on the body. Not flattering at all.",0
5,It‚Äôs amazing purchase it made it easy to me wearing the shoes without caring about them also looks so good.,1
5,"Es un bolso peque√±o, muy bonito y coqueto,para cuando s√≥lo tienes que llevar algunas cosas.Llaves,cell .....",1
1,"These are not waterproof in the large black mesh area in front - beware!  It was a rude surprise when I needed it most, but thank goodness Amazon backed me on this one.  Returned!",0
1,Did not fit!,0
3,"The dress is sheer and the material reminds me of pajamas, for some reason I was expecting a thicker material. I was planning to wear this with a  longer utility jacket so I am going to keep it but I will not be able to wear this on its own. I guess for the price you cannot expect too much.",0
5,Was very well made and stayed on my head with the clip!! Was fun too.,1
5,Had to buy it one size up from my largest size but it fits and feels so nice.,1
3,These glasses look great but the lenses are very big.  They are indeed over-sized.,0
1,"This product was poorly made. The buckle was not even sewn on but rather it just had the elastic threaded through the buckle. Of course, it would not hold. Needless to say, this product has been returned.",0
5,C√≥moda y perfecta !  No se sube ni se mueve,1
3,I so wanted to like these socks. I wear a size 7-8 shoe and bought a size small in the socks. They are soft and comfortable and come in great colors. I thought the size was good but unfortunately the heels slip and creep down to the middle of my arch after taking just a few steps. I'm returning them and going back to injinji brand.,0
1,"I got these for my daughter.  She wore them once and one of them fell completely off.  Very disappointing because they are so cute.  No, I would not suggest these.",0
3,"The robe looks really good, but it doesn't absorb water as much as my previous robe did. The fabric is not the same as a towel fabric and hence the absorbency is lacking.",0
1,This is the most unflattering shirt I have ever purchased. For me nothing is cute nor practical about it!,0
4,Make sure your underwear aren't too dark of a color as these are see through. Don't even think about going commando.,1
5,Love the feminine flair.  Easy to find in my purse too.,1
3,"After having used a less expensive pair, we purchased these safety glasses. Of importance to us was the non fogging feature. Fact is, that this goggles fog just like the inexpensive pair. Very disappointed. The benefit is that they‚Äôre very clear and do not obstruct vision.",0
5,"I get compliments every time I wear these earrings. They are striking. They are large size but they don't scream at you. Very elegant. I love that because of all the colors I can wear with any color outfit. Note-these earrings are best with dressy clothes, not jeans.",1
1,"the black is more like a dark grey, and the proportions are different than in the picture. the &#34;black&#34; stone in the middle is small and the surrounding silver is more pronounced which wouldn't b such a big deal if it looked like silver. the quality is just horrible. i'm very disppointed",0
3,Well made but from.china and terribly mislabeled for size. Got a 9/10 for my small 8 year old and it is more like a 5/6. Far too small.,0
4,"Cute, but a little short for an older woman",1
2,"Arrived with no tag, material not as expected, not true to size chart by at least one full size too small. Have to return.",0
5,I was looking for an inexpensive piece to wear all the time. I have a baby and won't risk her yanking something pricy and breaking it. This necklace is perfect--looks more expensive than it was and also holds up to little fists. I'm very pleased.,1
3,Cute but size was way too small,0
3,I bought another pair from this company and I loved them so I bought this one next. They fit great. However the pattern is off balance. The two legs don‚Äôt match up.,0
4,I really liked it but it only took a week for me to break the glass.<br />Can you send me a new one?,1
5,I gave this as a gift to a 9 year old boy and<br />he loved it,1
5,"Arrived at a decent time, and works great. Affordable and useful. Perfect for replacing a missing or broken one.",1
2,they used to make a very soft cotton product - the quality is going down - seems like a harsher mesh material -,0
3,shoes is ok but the size is to big.,0
2,"Fresh out the box it looks amazing. The bottom fits me perfectly, but the top teeth are way to wide( for people like me who have small teeth). The instructions were simple but manage mess it up. To make a long story short, one mistake can mess the whole thing up beyond repair to were they are not even wearable anymore and u have to wait a couple extra days for them to come in, just buy two pair, trust me.",0
3,"Fits well over my glasses. However, it does not keep the glare down much.  Should be darker.",0
4,Runs big. Probably two sizes too big. And it was expensive to get it resized at a seemstres.,1
4,"some bad reviews from others but seems to be working fine after a year in use. Fortunately for me, my $8,700 Rolex, oops I mean my $8.70 Rulox has a Chinese battery to power it.",1
5,"As pictured. Came in a beautiful, and quite large, pink velvet bag. Nice quality and great looking! Would recommend and buy again!",1
3,"If you have a long torso, size up! I ordered an XL, but received an L. Let me tell you, that I doubt the XL would have done much difference. The L ""fit"", and my butt cheeks were halfway out. It was more like a cheeky romper. Doubt that the XL would have covered my butt cheeks. Material was nice, I'd try again, but maybe I'd buy an XXL perhaps",0
3,Solo tres Estrella soya m y este me qued√≥ un poco grande despu√©s todo üòä bien,0
4,"Actually better than I expected.  The only complaint is the emblem on the legs of the glasses:  they are not glued down properly and snag my hair whenever I put them on or take them off.  The lenses are clear and the mirror reflects major glare.  All in all, an acceptable 'cheap' sunglasses for someone who is always losing or breaking them.  Will order more in variety of colors.",1
3,somewhat larger then I wanted so i dont get all the benefits from wearing them.,0
4,"It's a very cute dress. Fabric is a bit on the cheaper side for my taste, but I donated this to my sisters friend. She looked stunning with it on at an event she put together.",1
5,aw----- can't beat Pooh Bear!!,1
1,"You get what you pay for . While it was really cute , Mine fell apart when putting it on for the first time .",0
3,"not flattering to plus size with curves. To tight in chest area, odd length not long or short enough. Material not soft almost a still quality about it.",0
5,Love it!!!!,1
1,causes horrible blisters on your skin,0
3,Look I read all the reviews and they are misleading one guy said made in England. Another said it wasn't a cheap Chinese knok off. This jacket is no diferant than the ones you can get for 40 to 50 dollers I was hoping it would not be by the reviews I took a picture of the tag.. CHINA.  And it is not waterproof you will get soaked after awail. And top top this perchance off it took 5 and a half weeks to get.,0
1,Doesn't look like the picture. Not worth the money.,0
2,"I ordered the white of this dress months ago and is completely fine, but the light gray is cut lazily and has choppy fabric. The fit, sewing. And actual fabric quality is fine, but this one did not come with a bandeau as the white one did. I ordered the white from this same seller.",0
1,I was very disappointed in this product. While The quality was fine the patterning was nothing like what was pictured online. It is almost impossible to tell it was a leopard pattern as the background was so dark Iand the spots were barely barely visible. If you are looking for something like what is pictured this is not the product!,0
5,"Hat has a premium quality feel to it, almost MLB Nee Era like. The only complaint is that bill is probably some hard plastic material so it makes it<br />Hard to mold it but I like it",1
4,"I love Brighton jewelry, and I love this bracelet. For some reason I didn‚Äôt expect the side chains to separate from the inner chains.  It‚Äôs still beautiful, and I wear it every day. Surprisingly, I have not received any compliments on it.",1
2,"I've been wearing them for a month and they're already showing wear, the metal part is falling off exposing white parts underneath.",0
2,Just received it today... different color and it‚Äôs crew neck.. nothing like in the picture ..Dissapointing !!!,0
3,"Bought a pair of these for my bf who let‚Äôs say is blessed in the pants department. Bought the xl recommended for him yet his third member kept peaking out during leg sessions and on his runs, have to send back unfortunately cause of the fit but awesome material!",0
1,I honestly don‚Äôt know where to start...material was thick and bulky. The sleeves were so short and didn‚Äôt flare. It was not what I expected at all. üò≥,0
3,I like everything about this jacket except for the zipper which might be a deal breaker. It not only has the active part on the left like a woman's (wind flap is also on left which is correct for a man's jacket) also it is made of plastic which would be OK if it was of good quality and worked smoothly but it does not. It sticks  every few inches and has to be coaxed all the way up (goes down OK) Still deciding whether to send it back or not.,0
1,So disappointing such a cute dress was way too small,0
1,It was cheaply made . Not waterproof. Still sitting in my closet . I never gave it as a gift . Missed the return window so I‚Äôm stuck with this cheap piece of crap,0
4,"Not a bad material. They are thin, but soft. Not stiff like other cheap bandanas can be. I just use them to keep my hair off my face and they work perfectly for it.",1
5,Dress is comfortable and fit perfectly.,1
2,This is not really a jacket/blazer.  It's made of shirt material and fits really small.  I ordered an x-large and it fits like a tight medium or a small.,0
5,"These arrived via prime.  They are great quality and very comfortable,  snug fit so they do not make the traditional 'flip flop' sound.",1
3,"Thin material. Also, this took FOREVER to arrive!!",0
5,Great fit. Look great. Comfortable.,1
3,Looks very nice bit 3 of the bracelets ripped on the first time putting them on.<br />Be very careful!,0
2,Cute hat but iron on isn‚Äôt the best quality.,0
1,small,0
1,"1. I will never order anything that is not prime in the future.  So hard to return.  Such a bummer, this thing is HUGE and it just doesn't look quality.  I was very disappointed.",0
5,My Granddaughter loves her shoes!,1
5,Great dress for homecoming! Only wish came in a 0. Overall. 5 stars. Well made and arrived fast. Daughter loved it,1
1,I was expecting something a little more elaborate. There‚Äôs one speaker wired to the Bluetooth receiver and button system. No thanks.,0
5,This dress is well made and beautiful. It is nice for the price!,1
4,"Bare bones, but a great jacket if you don't want all the bells and whistles, like venting.",1
1,The material was cheap.... very thin and clingy. I returned it. I have a navy one that is a totally different material and appropriately sized.,0
3,"I attended an all white party and the dress came within two days :) The day of the event i put the dress on, however there was a small hole near my butt. I was super upset because I had to change my outfit and now I just wasted $20.",0
5,great sunglassess super like it,1
3,"It's a bit larger than I was expecting. Wish it was just a bit smaller. My fault though, should've read the specs more closely",0
4,Attractive and solid construction.,1
5,"Not your grandma's apron.  Beautiful bold designs, water proof fabric.  just love it!",1
5,Good you well made and I love the free  Gel inner soles they gave me,1
5,I loved the length and how flowy the dress is. It's comfy but pretty. It falls nicely but could use some definition with a belt but a snug cardigan works good too.,1
5,I purchased to take with me to Vegas but was concerned that it wouldn‚Äôt fit once I received it. I tried it on and it fit perfectly!,1
5,"I bought this in a ‚ÄúL‚Äù for a 17 y/o who is 6‚Äù1, 185lbs with a long torso. It fit and looks great. The quality is excellent. Wash on cold, gentle cycle and laid flat to dry.",1
5,"I GIVE 5 STARS MAINLY FOR THE SERVICE<br /><br />I bought one but it was BROKEN, BUT SUPER DEAL HAS SENT ME ANOTHER<br /><br />GREAT",1
3,Much smaller than expected,0
5,Perfect one for ma son üëç,1
5,Loved it.,1
4,"i got the rainbow bottom ones, they came when expected. the bottoms look like they will fall off if i walk too hard or something though, very cute ill update the review if they break easily",1
1,These tank tops run so small. I got an XL that fits like a S. So frustrating!,0
5,She wants you to know these tanktops make her feel sexy af. Highly recommend for the price. Comfortable for housewear and athleticwear.,1
5,Bought this as a gift for a guy. He loved it. He doesn‚Äôt play guitar or anything but ‚ÄúI pick you‚Äù had a meaning between us üòâ. It is as shown. Very cute.,1
3,Doesn't fit the same as it does in the pictures wide all around its okay,0
1,nice good looking but stopped working after 3 days<br />I wanted to return it but could not find the box,0
1,"Bought as a gift, sent, found they were too small and felt ripped off. For the price of these simple sandals one would think they can get the sizes right but guess not and likely fake or counterfeit goods.",0
5,"With the adjustable ear straps, it's possible to make the mask fit correctly.  I like the pocket for inserting filter.  They are comfortable.  These headbands were also included to help with comfort for long-time use of the masks.  Haven't used them yet, but they could be useful.",1
1,"The package arrived very quickly, but there‚Äôs no necklace in the black box! It‚Äôs completely empty.",0
5,Very nice shirt.. Good quality,1
5,They have a good sound and are very well made.,1
2,Personally didn‚Äôt care for them.,0
5,Fit as expected and a hilarious gift for the Bob's Burger lover.,1
2,1 out of 6  has a rough surface. It hadn't been polished. The other five ones are OK but the 3 unadjustable one are too small.,0
5,So comfortable and the material is very forgiving.,1
4,Need to break in a good product for the price.,1
1,"The color was beautiful.  The dress was much too small. I ordered a 2x. Since there was nothing I could do with it, I gave it to a friend. She loves it and it fits her perfectly.  SHE IS A SIZE 12!!!!",0
3,"They were sharp and honestly they hurt to put into my ears, so I used them for what I needed and haven‚Äôt worn them since.",0
2,"This shirt seems tailored for short, fat men. The length is too small relative to the size yet it is far too wide. If you have an average or athletic build and are looking for something form-fitting, pass on this one.",0
1,"Made in China by Zeagoo. It may not be the same as others received? It was returned before, ran small, had a hole under the arm and loose threads. Had It said it was made by Zeagoo and not some other company I would have never ordered it.",0
5,"Love these, comfortable and they don't fall out.",1
4,The dice themselves are excellent quality and weight. The chain on the other hand seems quite cheap.,1
5,Adorable scarf for a turtle lover! Beautiful blue color. Lots of compliments.,1
5,A great outfit for my 17 month granddaughter. I love flamingos and she recognizes them. How fun to have a colorful outfit with them on it!  Great quality. Got the 18-24 mo size and it has some room to grow but fits fine with the elastic ankles and waist.,1
2,"Too tight around shoulders, too short, itchy material, see through .. sorry",0
1,It was not as displayed. Necklaces are too short and wolf pendent does not hang properly.,0
5,Very cute fit with the cap sleeves.,1
3,I loved these pants when they arrived. But they‚Äôre about 4‚Äù too long and following the instructions I washed them first and now they look faded. I‚Äôm a bit sad. I really love the cut,0
1,"Probably one of the worst watches I have ever purchased. very difficult to read the time, has an annoying alarm that i can not stop. DONT Buy IT!!",0
5,"Excellent sandal.  It does just dry right off, which is great after using a gym shower.  I would definitely buy again.",1
5,"Fits perfect and is flattering, everytime I wear this sweater I get compliments. It was a great choice for a reasonable price. I have purchase several sweaters from PattyBoutik and I am never dissatisfied.",1
1,Waaay too small. Purchased a size larger to avoid fitting too small. Need to purchase 3-4 times larger than normal!,0
3,"The goggles are Awesome! 5 stars for them!<br />Has a nice case, suctions great, and had ear things attached.<br />The swim cap though was useless though! 0 stars for that!  My whole head was wet when I go out of the pool.",0
2,"The pants are inexpensive so they are as expected very thin material, but the sizing is off. The ones I got are way too big to be reasonable on a body my size. I'm 5'7"" 135 lbs, I got the size M and they are way too big. And the waist closure is drawstring, I would have prefered elastic.",0
1,No support at all. If I move wrong everything will fall out.,0
1,"It seemed nice and fit well, but it already came apart at the connection point.  The rest of the band still looks brand new. I could have easily lost my watch, but fortunately caught it. Not worth the money. Do not recommend.",0
3,I've broken two of these. The first was the metal clip that holds the badge holder. The second was the plastic quick disconnect that goes behind the neck.,0
5,Nice,1
1,"After four months, they started coming apart....the sole separating from the top!",0
4,"I purchased a size small. For reference I'm 5'7"", 140 lbs. The length was good - which is something I struggle with regarding pants. The material is very thin almost like Pajamas but I am still comfortable wearing it outdoors. I ordered some other colors because it's an easy outfit to have to throw on around the house or running quick errands.",1
3,I bought the maroon colored dress...i like the fit its very light and comfortable for the summer....the only reason i gave it a 3 is because....the material has a very weird smell ....ive washed it 3 times already and the smell still lingers....very weird,0
2,"I ordered what I thought was for my 32 waist, but it was more like a 34 with an inseam of 34. I don't know if sizes are consistent with this brand but it was disappointing to say the least.<br /><br />I will return and not consider this brand any more.<br /><br />Thanks.",0
5,Live the color and the fit!,1
5,Length is long!,1
5,Purchased for my teen daughter.  She loves it!  Easy to dress up or down.,1
5,Excelente calidad,1
3,Great size but the material is not so great.,0
4,Very pretty. Just small. It only clips on first hook. But it‚Äôs very pretty and lays right on my collar bone.,1
5,Was a gift they were very happy with the hat<br />Just wish they could be located in the US,1
5,"This dress is a little too long on me, but it is convenient because I do not have to iron it. I love the material and the pockets.",1
5,This is a very cute and nicely Made necklace.  Well worth it for the price.  I receive many compliments when wearing it.  I definitely recommend this as a gift purchase or for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.,1
1,The sole was very hard which was uncomfortable. Recommended size was way too big. Returned the same day received.,0
5,Great watch at a great price,1
5,Very good.,1
5,Color is on point. Fit is exactly as expected. I'm very comfy and happy wearing this with leggings or sweats :),1
1,"The watch is beautiful, but the strap lock opens unexpectedly. I believe I was not lucky in my purchase.",0
5,I love it! It stands up and has a strong foundation. LOVE,1
5,They came fast and were perfect,1
3,"LOVE the colors but, sadly, they are too tight for my hubby's head. We are doing what we can to stretch them out but not sure it is going to work. I won't repurchase since they don't fit but, again, I love the colors and they seem to be nice quality.",0
4,My best friend loves Elvis (and so do I) so she was very happy with it!,1
1,The zippers on the ankles broke the first time they were worn.,0
5,"Love this bag for light travel/overnights. The color is great. Has a vintage feel to me, which I love.<br />Easy to pack & carry around. Will get allot of use out of this one.",1
5,DEFINITELY COMPRESSION SOCKS,1
3,My husband usually wears a large. 6ft 200lbs.. yet he had to order a 2xl in order to get the fit right,0
5,"The stiching is very clean and strong, materials are a very good quality. Love this bag!",1
3,Overall decent for the price but several sizes are missing pieces,0
5,"So cute! Fits great, looks just like the picture, and the material is not even remotely see-through! Love it! :)",1
5,"Love the shirt, fits as expected, very comfortable.",1
2,I wear a M/L so I up sized to XL due to compression. It is soooo tight. I look like a 10lb sausage in a 5lb case. Not sure when I can actually fit in it. I may return it. It‚Äôs way too too small.,0
2,Wanted a thinner belt.  Buckle is huge.,0
5,"This laptop bag has a great finish. it was not as dark orange as it looked on my laptop, but that may be because of my laptop's light or whatever. I love it. It's comfortable and glossy, and feels sturdy.",1
1,Tarnished fast and didn‚Äôt really go with the watch style.,0
5,"I loved the colors and patterns.  Also, the pocket for filters was perfect.  When you snap the scarf in the back, you can take the mask off your ears and drop it down.  You don't lose you mask that way.  I really like these.",1
1,I had the bracelet less than a day and it fell apart. It happened when I was standing in the grass in the dark and we could never even find the pieces to fix ir return it. I was so mad!!,0
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!!!!! I received an empty package. I am beyond angry!,0
5,"Fit perfectly, easy to switch out. Ice blue mirror looks great. Grey warm rose tint is fine but the original blue throughout was crisper. Nonetheless, very good replacement lenses for the price.",1
5,"This was a replacement for an identical ring that was lost.  It is a little more expensive than other rings of this type, but is well worth it.  The design is chiseled into the ring and is very attractive without being too busy.  We would recommend this ring without hesitation.",1
5,"I have a metal allergy and generally can only wear 10 kt or up gold.  I put these on the day after I received them and have had no problem. They ate pretty and as the seller described them,",1
2,Nice colors and combination.,0
1,"I am 285 LBS, 38DD, 5'8, wear a size 12, and ordered a size XXL.  The print is adorable but this suit is poorly made.  There was NO bust support,  and barely any coverage in the behind.  It's a very cheap suit... if you have a rear end and a big bust, this suit is NOT for you.",0
5,My husband likes these for fall days when he‚Äôs outside coaching high school soccer in chilly NH,1
1,Box came empty. There was no pendant,0
1,"I followed the washing and drying instructions, but it shrunk so that they are now ""floods"" and the arms don't reach my wrists.  The buttons are as small as the button holes so they pop open constantly.  I tried to return them but Amazon now has a weird bar code system that I need to take to the post office instead of being able to print the return label and drop it off when they are closed. I never got to the post office while they were open and now I can't return them.",0
2,The pads do not fit my Bolle Sunglasses and the sender does not include any contact information other than a mailing address.,0
2,in about 3 weeks I lost already the bracelet 5 times with basic activities. They are not secure enough.<br />Otherwise they look good but you can potentially loosing your Mi Band because of this.,0
5,"I bought these to wear for hiking because I hate sunscreen, but needed something to keep from burning. I wore these on a hike with temperatures in the 80's and I was comfortable enough. They fit a little tight, but as I am used to wearing loose cotton most of the time, it mostly just preference. I did get one size larger than I usually wear and I am glad I did.",1
1,"NPS emblem is phony, cheap-looking iron- on, not a sewn on patch. Also, color of the hat is not as pictured, it is actually a chocolate brown. Not worth the money.",0
5,The pretty unicorn key chains are even nicer than the picture!  A perfect ‚Äòunicorn party‚Äô favor for the 13 year old girls.,1
3,One of the bands broke where it clicks in the watch as soon as i worn it within a couple of days of use.,0
5,"These legging are so comfortable, I can wear them to bed and be warm and comfy. They are high waisted and form fitted. I ordered a large. I weigh 140 lbs.",1
4,From the picture the necklaces wasn't the size I was expecting but still pretty nice,1
4,"Hi-Tie men classics tie, handkerchief, and cufflinks.<br />Love the tie and the kerchief. The Catholics would‚Äôve been great except they were damaged, smashed so they can‚Äôt be worn.  Can I get another pair?<br />Please text me so we can get this resolved.<br />mercybelle@yahoo.com<br />Thank you so much.<br />Michelle",1
5,Lovely,1
2,Most of the pieces I tried to snap in they fell apart there not correctly made.,0
4,"Pretty but runs very small ‚Äî I wear an XS to S in most things (25 inch waist, 33 inch hips) and ordered a small, but I could barely close the zipper. Also, it‚Äôs not an elastic waist like it says. I may reorder in a larger size, though, bc I actually really love the pattern and colors!",1
2,Lousy fit. Big head don't buy.,0
5,These are just as I expected from the pictures! Very cute and have already gotten compliments.,1
3,Ordered &#34;grey&#34; but definitely got a brown wallet. Bigger than I would prefer.,0
5,Excelente calidad! Me encanta..,1
5,They are well made and fit great.,1
3,"Loved this Key Chain, very clean and stylish look. Unfortunately the key chain fell apart after only 6 months of use. Thought Mehr had a better quality.",0
5,It's very stylish  and large  enough to  accommodate  a large watch.  It's very quiet,1
5,Can dress down or up. Comfortable and stylish.,1
2,"Band watch is pretty good, tool to remove links got broken in first try, I needed to pay to adjust it properly",0
5,Nice look,1
3,"I own quite a few more costly watches, but this one caught my eye and I had to have it. I must say I wasn't eager to wear it frequently, but I had to give it a chance. Upon first sight it looks great, but being a perfectionist the watch had some flaws I couldn't get over right away. It sat in one of my watch boxes for a bit. It doesn't feel like top quality, but it gets the job done for what it is. I knew right away the ""leather"" band wouldn't be worth the time so I ordered a replacement band. The chronograph is kind of a joke to be honest, and the glass almost has a fisheye lens aspect to it. However for the average wearer this watch looks more expensive than it is, and tells time accurately enough. I dare not test it's water resistance and am careful to not bang it against anything while I wear it. So bottom line is it could be a nice everyday watch, but that's about it. I hate to be so critical, but for the price it is what it is. It is a semi large watch (which is fine cause I have monster hands) and I would purchase again without huge expectations.",0
3,"Happy with lightweight, color, and size.  Neck/collar stretched out looking and looks cheap for the pricing.  Would not buy again.",0
4,"I automatically fell in love with the dress when it arrived. I ordered a large and the dress fit snug around my chest area. I‚Äôm a 36-38 d which I usually never have problems, but the zipper on this dress is kinda ‚Äúflimsy‚Äù and I didnt want to risky tearing it if I tugged too hard.",1
1,Broke the day I got it. A complete waste of money.,0
2,It was 1 week later then the delivery date which was already almost 2 months so I didn‚Äôt receive them from 2 months that I had ordered them and the black was faded so not what I had expected at all and definitely not worth the wait.,0
1,"No matter what I did when I put it on it just became very wrinkled, in a bad way not in a cute way. I would not recommend this top.",0
5,"Chic look and quite dark. Really helps with my over-sensitivity to light post laser surgery. Lost my first pair and immediately ordered another exact replacement. Both pair came beautifully wrapped, boxed, and carefully packaged along with a soft protective pouch. Very comfortable to wear. My favorite sunglasses in a long time .",1
5,This dress was perfect for the beach,1
1,Cute idea but very poorly executed. It looked horrible. Fabric was cheap. Don‚Äôt bother.,0
4,It's nice.,1
1,Just as previous review said it is shorter than it looks comes way above knees,0
5,Great product,1
1,"Bought this for a graduation gift for my niece - came in nice packaging with a cute little gift bag and she loved it.  However, the chain broke less than a month after I gave it to her so I wouldn't recommend this for a charm or even frequent wear.",0
2,"This set is nothing special, that‚Äôs for sure. I was disappointed to see how thin the fabric is, and the color just looked like the outfit was dirty instead of actually being tie-dyed. It did fit true to size, so I guess it‚Äôs a good fall pajama outfit, but nothing cute to see here. I‚Äôd rather have kept browsing and spent my money on something a little better quality.",0
4,"I bought these to take with me to the hospital while delivering my baby. I was looking for something comfortable and easy to put on. I normally wear a size 9.5 to 10, my feet are not normally swollen but due to pregnancy I had slightly swollen feet. These shoes are cute but don't fit right, they ran small for me without out socks even months after giving birth.  My heel would stick out, not great for socks either.  They are super cute! I would just recommend going a size up if available.",1
3,"This shirt is so cute! Fabric is perfect and very comfortable. Color is exactly as pictured. However, the sizing is very off! I normally wear a medium but occasionally order larges. I ordered 2 of these in different colors. BOTH were large hoping it would big flowy like pictured. 1 of them fits perfectly as expected, but the other is about 2 inches shorter than the other and much less skinnier. Not what a normal large would be considered. Same shirt, same size, just different colors. Disappointed I will have to return the one too small!",0
2,It had a hole in it.,0
1,Terrible quality. The dress looked and felt very cheaply made and looked almost nothing like the image. I returned it immediately.,0
3,It‚Äôs super cute. I ordered a medium and it was a little big in the armpits for me but I can still wear it. Only problem was the seam under one of the armpits was ripped when I received it. I sewed it back together because I didn‚Äôt want to wait on a return!,0
1,The band is way too small 3-4 inches too short,0
3,"I love the concept of this wallet. The price makes it an ok purchase. The zipper on one side gets stuck often. I thought it was because the business cards I kept in it were getting too close so I switched where I put them, yet the issue persists.<br /><br />I also dislike that there are no holes where the ID window is. This makes it very hard to get it in and out. I will likely try and use a medium hole punch to make it easier to get in and out.<br /><br />It arrived quickly and I like the color. It holds a lot of debit/credit/rewards cards, but I have to store them sideways so I can get them in and out easier. They go in too far otherwise and it‚Äôs a struggle to get them out when using them.",0
3,Material around the waist is more elastic and hugs your hips. It does not fall loosely.,0
5,I LOVE these pajamas. They're not too thin or too thick. The fabric is super soft and has a little stretch to it which is the best. Super cute packaging too. Highly highly recommend.,1
3,"surprisingly comfy--i'm just not totally sure what to wear them with.  You definitely need to cut on the tag, b/c when you fold down the sides on these, the tag hangs out and looks cheap.  But otherwise they're really cute and comfy--and I'm very picky about shoes.  For the price they're very nice, but I need to figure out how to wear them.",0
5,"Great fit for my face,  which is on the larger side.  Comfy, sturdy, and feels great.  I feel protected wearing this!",1
2,The dress stretches so it should be a little smaller.,0
2,"Advertised as extra long, but was just normal length socks",0
1,"LOL, this would never keep a button on.",0
2,Sizes run small and the zipper sticks a little.,0
5,Granddaughter loves bling!,1
2,It definitely isn‚Äôt for short women like myself. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù even. So it looked way to big. Wasn‚Äôt as cute as the pic either.,0
2,"Ordered XXL, they fit like a large. Very very tight and short on my huge torso. I guess if you're one of the studly types and wear medium T-shirts when you are an XL, these under-sized gems are for you. I now know why they were a daily deal. To the church rummage sale they go. I am Huuge Billy, and these tanks are not.",0
5,It‚Äôs so nice not to have to take off my sunglasses to put on my readers,1
5,"Sturdy yet compact, can be used with formal dressing too!",1
4,Great transaction. Very hard to see and breathe in the mask though. Good for short periods and to wear it on your head.,1
2,Deformed after about a year of use. For the price may not be worth it.,0
3,I love the design but it just makes wrist green.,0
5,Lots of space for everything. Nice wallet I'm pleased with the purchase.,1
1,They were broken when taken out of the package,0
5,My dress and accessories were a perfect fit.,1
4,"This wallet is really great, it comes wrapped so impressively it looks great. It can hold all my credit cards, DD cards and insurance. cards without being to bulky. The zipper compartment is great for cash and odd change. Fits well in my purse and in my back pocket. My only complaint is the zipper pull snapped broke off and I need to find something to replace it. A great wallet.",1
5,"The tongue rings came in when they were supposed to. I didn't pay enough attention to the title and didn't realize the balls on these were smaller than was I am used to, however I actually like these better. The balls aren't hard to unscrew and they stay on. If I happen to lose one, I will be purchasing again!",1
1,This product is cheaply made and arrived broken. Bangles are nothing like what is shown on the picture. Look like toy bracelets I buy at the $1 store. Cheap quality product. Color runs. Terrible product.,0
5,good,1
1,"The bag I received is half the size of the one shown in the photo.  The handles on mine will not fit over the shoulder of a woman the size of the one in the photo.  It's not ""evening"" elegant but it's too small for a useful casual daytime bag.  It's inconvenient if you expect to shoulder your bag to have your hands free for shopping, holding your children's hands, etc.  My advice is to skip it.  I'm returning mine.",0
5,This is a very well made wig.  I definitely will recommend it.,1
3,"Necklace is awesome, earrings not so much. They Constantly flip and u have to readjust them",0
1,Really cheap material,0
5,5 star,1
5,received the sunglasses quickly and well packaged. I bought these to accompany the Pete the Cat Magic sunglasses book for a three year old girl. She absolutely loved both! Highly recommend this seller.,1
3,It has great pockets.  My only wish would be for it to have a little stretch because it doesn't yield when you roll over in your sleep.  Otherwise very comfortable.,0
1,Hanes products have been made cheaper and cheaper over the years  Absolutely no elastic in the legs - just sags<br />I've spent about $100 looking for their good old fashion underwear they used to make.  This isn't it!!!  Hanes used to be known for excellent under garments................sadly not any more.  Time to find something new,0
3,"The face is larger than expected. Problem, the hands do not glow in the dark. Otherwise nice product, would give 4 stars if glowed.",0
4,The shoe is comfortable. I would recommend going up a half size due to the shoe running a little small.,1
5,"Fits so beautifully! Soft and flexible and casual chic. I ordered a large and I am 5,7"" and 185lbs, size 39C bra. I will be buying more colors and trying the short sleeve version this summer as well! A+!!!",1
4,My daughter loves the pockets. It is a very vibrantly colored.,1
5,"I love this dress! It is good quality material and it‚Äôs actually very flattering. It‚Äôs also nice because you can wear it whether you‚Äôre short or tall. I thought that it would look bad on me because I‚Äôm so short, but it still looks pretty decent because you can bunch it up at the waist to fit shorter! The slit is not too high, just enough to be cute but not too revealing. I would recommend!",1
5,Beautiful and practical sweater!,1
5,Just what I was looking for .. they are small and will be good for children‚Äô s masks .,1
5,"Love this watch, light weight but stays on very well; no slipping; nice large face for easy reading",1
5,"Great product, very comfortable",1
2,Way too small and I have small ankles!,0
4,great,1
5,Great quality product that gets the job done,1
5,love the dress.,1
1,These shoes honestly feel like thicker socks. I didnt like how they sat on the feet. Kind of like slippers.,0
5,I honestly bought these for my office because it's below freezing everyday.  These are perfect! I'm nice and toasty all day.,1
2,The thong part is very hard and not comfortable wear them for shower at gym and glad that it‚Äôs only for 5-10 min a day,0
3,"I was really excited to see this since the picture looked so comfy. Reality is I should have sized up, so it would look loose like the picture. I got my size and it just fits awkward. It is a little tighter than I wanted which doesn't help the look of it at all. I'm glad I did buy it in black and it looks ok. I put it in the washer and dryer and it did great, so there's that.",0
1,There cheap But They Rip Way too easy,0
4,fit good,1
4,Looks very pretty,1
5,beautiful on my wife,1
5,"Fits really well, well made. Is a good hat!",1
1,"Must have been made for small people. There is no way to get on my foot and leg, and I am average person of size.",0
3,was expecting this to be China-sized but it is actually normal American clothes size,0
3,a little light weight.,0
5,Daughter loves these shoes,1
5,She loved it,1
5,"Would purchase again, great fit",1
1,The opening of hook is too small and makes it very hard to remove from a belt loop. I thought the bottle opener was actually the release. Tried it once and into a drawer of useless items it went.,0
3,These masks are great quality but they are very big. It says kids mask but maybe like a 10 year olds face could fit. The colors are fun and vibrant.,0
1,These are cute but big for my daughters necks to be considered chockers.,0
3,Love the screw but it unscrewed and fell out within a week,0
1,the lights stop working pretty quickly,0
5,Beautiful pattern vibrant colors. I am a size 16 xl. The 3xl fit perfectly. I'm very happy with my purchase. I may buy more.,1
2,"This dress is cute. However, the dress is made from cheap thin fabric. I would not consider this as a semi formal dress but more as a party or date night dress. If you are looking for quality this is definitely not the dress you would want to purchase. However if you are looking for a fun inexpensive dress that you will only wear once in your life then this is the dress for you.",0
5,Fits greats for a great price,1
2,the stones were not alighned properly and have never worn it,0
1,"Junk, broke after one wear. Bought nicer, cheaper ones at Walmart.",0
5,love these boots!! so cute and unique,1
3,Runs very small. The shorts are way too short. Cute t-shirt,0
2,Quality was excellent. Size too small even though usual size was ordered.,0
1,These are not very flexible and do not conform well to the back of your head or neck.,0
4,"Didn't care for look of fringe around ankle, fringe down the side would have looked much better I think.",1
5,"Bought to customize for teams, while I didn‚Äôt originally buy them to engrave they work well",1
5,He like them,1
2,"There are not many Born shoes I don't like but these are one of them. They are not very comfortable, they cut into your feet and they don't look as nice on. I returned them.",0
5,"It's lightweight the band is not stiff It's flexible. You would need a smaller wrist for this watch. It has just what I need the day, time and date. Now at work I can just look at my watch, instead of trying to figure out what day on the week it is and also I do not have to look at the computer to get the time. This watch is great for everyday use.",1
1,Horribly scratchy material. Size to fit an 8-year old but not a grown woman. Cannot return for full credit. I will never buy from this oversea‚Äôs manufacturer again.,0
5,Comfortable and good quality!,1
5,My sister loves these and said they're a little bit tight but they haven't ripped or anything.,1
3,"Well worth the very inexpensive price.  One complaint is that it is quite difficult to set, both because of hard to understand directions and small size.  I wanted the small size, but fail to understrand why a company as large as Casio can not hire a few people that can communicate in English to write their manuals.",0
1,"These stones came with no certification, and they claim to be untreated, but they are 100% dyed, after cleaning my jewelry return soap and water they left blue stains on the paper towel I laid them onto dry",0
2,Didn't bring the funnel or tools to put ashes into urn. the necklace itself it really big and looks more like costume jewelry,0
5,Excellent product for the money. Well worth it.,1
1,"awful material, returned",0
1,"I will never by another watch like the one I bought at amazon,It was a great price but for the money it wasent worth it.",0
5,On time.  Exactly as descibed.,1
5,I really like this hat perfect for the beach,1
4,the product is suited for children as described,1
1,"Nice billfold but zipper BROKE!!! So not happy! Would like a replacement or refund,",0
5,I love this shirt! The fit is very flattering and fit better than expected. It is true to size and not to deep of  a neck line. Will be buying another one,1
5,Great pjs,1
3,This scarf isnt very full looking when worn. I wasnt expecting something amazing but I was expecting it to be a tad bit more high quality. Oh well I suppose you get what you pay for.,0
4,"This item is beautifully crafted, but delicate, very very delicate. Detail is amazing, but it broke just trying it on! Very disappointed cause beads went every-damn-where... LOL. I have children so was more concerned for choking hazard and stepping on them as well on Hardwood floors, not carpet. But would buy it again and just be super super careful.",1
5,I have used these for myself and wanted to get some layers for my daughter who rides horses.  It gets cold in her barn during winter riding and these work great along with other layers.,1
4,This dress was more amazing than we expected. Very flattering. I ordered this for my niece's prom last minute and the quality is great! The only downfall was that the halter and the crisscross straps cut so high on her neck she couldn't breathe. The dress was very long as well. We took it to a seamstress and cut the straps and sewed them in regular tank straps. She also cut about 3inc off the bottom. It fits perfectly. She looked amazing for prom and was very excited it had pockets to put her phone.,1
3,Great deal! I enjoy the medium size bag the most!,0
5,Nice,1
1,It broke within the first week....don't get it wet at all,0
5,"I like these a lot. More comfortable than surgical masks. They are soft, breathable and washable and very comfortable. Better yet MADE IN USA.",1
5,Beautiful!  Wore for an all white boat party with a splash of purple in honor of Prince was a great accent,1
2,Great quality material but the snaps are falling out.,0
3,light weight,0
5,Totally satisfied my expectations for the price.,1
4,"Both lens are very loose in the frame, and one pops out very easily, making it hard even to wipe them clean. I knew I was buying very cheap sunglasses so I suppose I shouldn't expect too much, though I was surprised at how loose and easy to pop out the lens are.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed the seller about this issue and they sent me a new pair, which did not have this issue at all. The new glasses are great, and exactly what I had hoped for when I initially bought.",1
5,I love the color on these shoes the metcon has always been the perfect bike for my foot but these colors complete the look,1
2,Run small.<br />Size up.,0
1,Pues me dice entregado y desde el 11 de enero y ya estamos a 13 y no me a llegado,0
1,I ordered a size larger than i normally wear and it was still too small,0
5,Super cute sleeveless dress with pockets. I purchased this for a plaid themed event and it's exactly as I hoped. I added a blank tank top and black belt. It's fits great. I'm 5'4&quot; approx 140-150 lbs and this is a medium. Size 34 c. Depending on the bra I wear the top buttons may not close but it looks super cute with a black tank.,1
2,I love this bag I need to say that first. However it is now middle of July and I purchased the bag in early March. The black trim is starting to come off of the handles.  Extremely disappointing because I expect a better level of quality when I'm going to spend money on an item like this and normally I like coach. However now I'm concerned that there may be a quality issue  with coach and I  and that confident that I will buy another coach purse in the future if this is any indication of the quality of their bags now,0
5,Looks exactly like the images.,1
4,"These are the coolest sunglasses! Lightweight, fun, and great for sun protection. My only nitpick is that there's no contouring over the nose. The flat look kinda reminds me of 3D glasses from the movies. Other than that these are wonderful.",1
2,It makes me look like megamind,0
5,Looked Great!!!,1
2,Pretty but large..,0
1,Material has changed from previous bought. Did not like this Material.,0
1,Had holes in them,0
1,Scratches really easy as the black faceplate fell off within a few days of wearing it at basic training. Can't get the pedometer to work and my wrist always presses buttons accidentally also the compass is not accurate at all and neither is the temperature,0
5,So adorable!!!!  These added the perfect touch to our son's superhero-themed bedroom.  The kids love them.  Great deal.,1
5,it fit my daughter like a glove. Perfect for freshman homecoming,1
1,The material looked and felt cheap. The length was not as advertised. You get what you pay for. It‚Äôs back to the original untucked shirt for me!,0
5,Just as I expected,1
3,Wife likes it.  It fits ok. But could be a little longer at the waistline,0
1,The colours are same as the picture. But not comfortable to wear. The sharp is bad.,0
5,Sparkly! I loved it. I didn't expect anything close to what I got for this price. It actually looks expensive. Earring are really pretty too! It's elastic and fits me perfectly. No discomfort at all. I went to a wedding with these. They're really pretty.,1
2,Very difficult to clasp and almost immediately caused irritation. They do look as pictured and are pretty though! But I will not be able to wear them :(,0
5,Love it and a great gift to give to my niece for her graduating this year!,1
5,These socks are great. Just the right length. Support without binding. Extremely comfortable!,1
1,Product not as shown. Fabric flimsy. Jacket looks NOTHING like the picture. I purchased this for my daughter's Willy Wonka costume. Thinking once she was done she would have this nice red jacket to use on a regular bases. NOTTTTTT!!!!,0
3,Wish the shirt went lower below the waist. Otherwise it would be perfect.,0
1,Very wrinkle prone fabric and the shorts were like wearing an oversized bag.,0
3,Kid sizesd.... to small for adult men,0
5,Liked everything on the product,1
2,This was a beautiful band but it broke two weeks later. üòî,0
5,Bought this to be Wendy for Halloween a few years ago. Worked out perfectly and I‚Äôve worn it again a few times since then!,1

5,This a present for my grand-daughter and was so thrilled with her purple watch which is her favorite color. She wears it all the time. I am very pleased with the watch. It met all that it was advertised.,1
4,"I really, really liked this dress but I wanted something just above the knee and it was shorter; more like mid thigh. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 146 lbs. Drats!",1
5,"I love these glasses!  People always compliment them.  And most people think they are Ray Bans.  I have bought 2 pairs in different colors (so far).  I love them for summer because they are light weight.  Also, they are polarized!  So you can‚Äôt beat the price!  Definitely will be buying more.",1
1,"What arrived was much longer than pictured.  Also,  you see the inside of the item while wearing and it looks terrible and unfinished.  Runs big.",0

1,"comfortable and good fit. They even have the them in wide. Here are the problems I am having.<br />1. No tab on the front and back of the boot to grab and slide your foot into the boot. Trying to get them on was too much effort.<br />2. trying to take them off after a few hours was no picnic either. My boots are loose fit once in them,<br />despite all of this half of my sock comes off after a struggle to take them off.<br />3. These boots are SLIPPERY. I slipped on the boat's bridge ladder so unexpectedly where of my other footwear held a much better grip.<br />4. From this manufacturer and at this price I expected a much better product.",0
5,I brought 80 of these with me and passed them out to people at an electronic show.  They were an instant hit.  The lights last about 3 hours.,1
5,I like everything about this body suit minus the plastic crotch snaps. I think it would have been better to use either metal snaps or Velcro as the plastic ones come undone every time I sit down. I was able to sew in Velcro that solved the problem.,1
4,"I wear a 10.5 size shoe.<br />Size L is slightly smaller.<br />Great socks. Fit great, wicks moisture as stated and keeps the feet warm",1

3,I wore it to my son's wedding reception but it wasn't the best quality.,0
3,It was not easy to walk in them. Everything else was fine.,0
5,Super cute,1
3,Good product from what I can tell. I wanted an earring set for my 7 holes in each ear without being pomed by studs. I was able to squeeze these thru a few holes but I didn't want to have stretched holes. So I took them out after a few days.,0
4,"Very good material. Overall, a good wallet for the price. It is a little wider than I like, but still suits my needs",1
3,This case is advertized as &#34;extra large&#34; but it was too small to fit my standard large sunglasses. Had to return.,0
2,"Attractive BUT, frame broke on 2 pr. w/o being dropped very quickly.  One frame broke while being worn.  In darker shade color rubs off on bridge of nose.  Haven't even pulled out other 2 PR. Not sure why I gave them 2 stars!",0
1,"Cheaply made, as expected. Very unhappy that the pocket fabric was not as shown. Really not worth it.",0
5,Beautiful earrings,1
4,"Nice and comfy. The only issue I have is the sleeves being a little baggy, but other than that, its a great product",1
5,"These are great.  Especially for the price.  I have some grinderpunch oversized sunglasses as well.  Those are a few $ cheaper, but feel substantially worse quality wise.",1
1,Did not met expectations,0
5,I like the fact that it doesn't tug on my ears like a regular mask does. It's very comfortable.,1
5,Bought this bow tie for prom and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint! The packaging was cool and the tie even cooler! Fits like a charm after a few adjustments and a stunner!,1

5,Its Beautiful. I love it!,1
1,Was very cheap and tacky! I need to return it but have deleted the info.,0
2,Too small and pockets in a weird place. I usually wear a small in these types of dresses but this was extra small and the pockets were too far up near my stomach.  Sending it back.,0
1,I am 6ft 275 and not a small guy and thats why i ordered 3XL. It fits very tight like an xl. Returning waste of time!  SIZE MATTERS!,0
2,"Cute, but won‚Äôt stay on.",0
5,"I like the color! It‚Äôs really vibrant! They have also green color, the next time I‚Äôll order it.  The fabric is soft and light. They can be perfect for sports or just walking outside. I worn them once, can‚Äôt say anything about durability but they look sturdy. One pack has 4 pairs. Easy order, fast shipping!",1
4,My husband normally buys Calvin Klein and fruit of the Loom. He got these as an effort to step out of his comfort zone. They fit well and true to size. His only negative comment is that he feels he has to pull them down a lot. They ride up a lot. He says material is comfortable though.,1
3,Bottoms were a tab bit cheekier than I had anticipated but still cute & comfy,0
4,Shoes  are super cute but fits a little snug on my baby foot. I would suggest size up,1

1,Returned immediately,0
5,"This is PERFECT. It's soft, it appears to be very comfortable. I bought it a month and a half before it's needed, so I took into account that my son my grow a little more, I ordered it a size up just to be safe.<br />It is SOOOO CUTE. I am VERY HAPPY!!!",1
4,"These are nice leggings. They are comfortable, stay in place, and thankfully for me, don't pick up pet hair. The color is also exactly what I expected. The only reason I am subtracting one star is because they are surprisingly not warm. I purchased these specifically to help survive the frigid midwestern winter. Despite the plush lining, the cold travels right through these leggings. Overall, I like these leggings and look forward to wearing them once the temperature climbs above the forties. Even if they weren't exactly what I was hoping for.",1
1,Disappointed!  The clip spring does not grip well and slides right off cards or bills. This was a gift for my husband and the engraving is an illegible mess. The letters are uneven and poorly done. Will return.,0
5,One of my favorite pair of pants I have ever owned. They are comfy and well made and fit perfectly. I wear size 10 and am 5'9 for reference.,1
5,"Absolutely my most favorite bathing suit I've ever owned! I've never been confidence in a swimsuit because of having weight in my stomach, but this high-waisted swimsuit hugs me in all the right places. I get compliments every time I wear it. The materials is great as well, very well-made. Honestly had no problem!  Fits great!",1

2,See through...,0
1,didn't fit and they wouldn't return.,0
2,Very disappointed! There were spots all around the handbag and the red bow ‚Äúbleed‚Äù red onto other parts of the handbag! It arrived misshaped as well. Wouldn‚Äôt order again!,0
4,The dress fit perfect!! I ordered a small. I'm 5'5 128lbs. Might be little short in back for some. But I was OK with it. I got a ton of compliments on. A new go to LBD,1
5,"Bought it for occasional wearing. Good solid, heavy piece. A few wears in and No signs of tarnish or turning green or losing shine. The latch seems to be holding up pretty well too. I get compliments on the style.",1
5,Excellent fun bags for party favors..very durable and useful,1
4,fits well and looks good,1
2,The bottoms are so thin they don't last long,0
1,Did even get to use it. It leaked and the mouth piece was hard to use.,0
2,Very poor quality and I had a lot of trouble with them when returning the product.,0
5,SO PRETTY. It came when expected and it's so pretty.The words are a bit small but it looks good. I also the rose gold looks a bit pink,1
1,Nice pics very bad material,0
5,"I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 136lbs, my bust is a b35, waist 30in, and hips are 41in (big hipped üòÑ). I ordered a s/m cus they were out of m/l. Regardless of this being somewhat small on me, it fits great/extremely comfortable. It squeezes my pudge on my hips more than i'd like, however, I don't feel ANY discomfort, regardless of these measurements. That's very surprising. I ordered the l/xl to see if that one will fit better without being too big or lose. The outfit makes me feel comfortable and sexy, and I don't even need a bra with it.",1
5,"Its very nice,came on schedule,too. But I don't need it anymore as I returned my alta.",1
1,"After one wash, the image was ruined and began peeling off.",0
4,"Pretty color and good quality bracelet, it was just too large for my wrist and I wasn't able to really tighten it to fit me at all so I returned it.",1
4,"I always wear a medium top, but this one fits more like a small.  I'd say order one size up (at least). Other than the slightly snug fit, it's really a cute sweatshirt.",1
5,"Very nice purse, large size which is what I wanted, I always carry a lot with me.  The purse seems really sturdy and well made, It stands up on it's own which is nice for meetings, church or what have you.  It came with a nice dust bag and personal note from the designer.  Have received lots of compliments on the design, it stands out in a crowd.  Would be nice if the lining was a lighter color as it can be hard to see things inside but I have this problem with a lot of bags.  I will be purchasing other bags from this maker.",1
1,The only likeness to the picture is the color.  It is not a sweater.  It is simply a long sleeve shirt.  The neck cut is totally different.  What a disappointment.,0
2,"Disappointed how quickly they got holes in the, especially for the price, in addition to the price being higher for the small size.",0
5,"Comfy, and doesn‚Äôt bunch.",1
5,Nice thick quality t-shirt. I've worn it and washed it twice and there hasn't been any fading or cracks in the picture,1
5,My husband really likes it,1
1,"We received the tailored style shirt in the new, shiny type of fabric that you can find in COSTCO stores right now and not as expected the original Kirkland Signature traditional style in the smooth cotton fabric, We sent it back right away and received a refund without a problem.",0
1,I returned the item. Size too small.,0
5,Love the material and length. True to size,1
2,The product was photographed as if it took up a good 6-8 inch space on the neck area like a jabeau. It arrived and is no more than 4.5 across.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre tiny size 5 or you want a string-tie effect it‚Äôs fine. But for a size 12 person like myself the effect is totally different‚Äî not nearly how it was presented on mannequin. Also the pin part is just glued on in back. Not great. Just so so.,0
5,"In case anyone is worried about allergic reactions, these have been great so far. Earrings are very cute and sturdy.<br /><br />Backstory:<br />My daughter got her ears pierced and I had bought a few different sets of earrings for her. The time came were we thought we could finally switch out her piercing studs. She chose a pair from a different set. We are not sure if she reacted to those or if us changing them damage the sensitive tissue, also the backs kept falling off so the earring kept coming out. Regardless, both ears started to react badly. I made her change them out to these and one ear began recovering right away and is healing perfectly.  The other ear was more infected by the time we switched to these and we are currently on antibiotics and it seems to be improving. I am so glad I bought these and she likes them since they do seem to be helping and she is going to have them in for awhile. The backs have stayed on perfectly even with the swelling. Hopefully the infection continues to clear and she is able to keep the piercing. She is looking forward to be able to wear the snowmen. Going to look at other sets soon.",1
2,This dress was very pretty but I did not like the belt. The belt would not stay in place and was too bulky for the dress. The sizing was way too tight on the top. I am not a large size peron and this dress was still too tight on top.,0
1,The necklace does not sit like the picture shows. EVER. Since it was so cheap I just kept it and put it in the back of my jewelry cabinet. My fault for ordering something so cheap in the first place.,0
5,Great shorts because they are think and confrtanke but also can dress them up. I‚Äôm a medium avg size 9 and they fit well,1
5,Such a fun costume/PJ!  Sazac is the most legit brand when it comes to good kigurumis.  I don't bother taking chances on others unless they are SUPER cheap.  This one is so warm too!,1
4,Not sure what to do with the bangs.  I would have to have them cut to use this wig.,1
2,Broken with normal gentle wear. The leather appears to have been weak near the clasp and broke after a short time of normal gentle use.,0
5,Did not dislike anything,1
5,"Cute, comfy fit and washes well.",1
3,"It‚Äôs just a ring.<br /><br />I mean, it‚Äôs cute, and it didn‚Äôt turn my finger green, but beyond that, it‚Äôs just a ring. It seems very cheap, but at the same time, I think it was only $13.99?<br /><br />I‚Äôm not sure if this qualifies as ‚Äúcostume jewelry‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt really do anything for me.",0
1,"The polish does work. But for how long? The lid is a joke, it will not shut and seal properly. And this will cause the wax to dry out over time. I'll be looking elsewhere next time. This is one of those problems that comes with buying on the internet.",0
1,My daughter really liked them but only got to wear them twice before the bottoms wore through. Was expecting to have them last longer but instead I am the owner of more garbage.,0
3,"It look nice on my daughter . Nothing special ,pretty colors .  We thought the waste was higher than it actually is .",0
5,Fast shipping<br />product fits perfect for what I needed,1
2,its too small for my boobs but underwear is alright.,0
1,Not great,0
5,These were absolutely adorable with my flower girl's dress. True to size. Would recommend to break them in first because they gave her a little blister on her ankle from rubbing.,1
5,Totally my style! All of them are amazing!,1
5,Perfect,1
5,"Have not worn this one yet, but cant wait.  All the others have been head turners, second glances.  This dress laundered well.  Machine washed and hung to dry...that's it.  Cant wait to wear it, I know it will be as great as the others.",1
2,"They were too small. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them.",0
3,"Top fit perfectly, but bottoms are too snug",0
3,Got two different style shirts...not as shown in picture...but will use them...,0
5,"Basic, Color as expected, Soft Material... just essential!",1
3,"Heavy, but great for the snow!",0
5,Just feel these socks and you will purr.  Colors were true to display ad and I'm planning on a &#34;Santa Trip&#34; for more of these for my daughters-in-law.,1
3,I liked the material of the rings but I didn't like that they are all the same size.....none fit my pinky or my thumb.,0
5,I like it looks good thank you,1
5,"I messed up on my sizing with my first purchase of this jacket but they let me return and purchase again with ease. It fits nicely, and people give me compliments all the time. I even ironed on my own patches",1
3,Very cute and comfortable! The torso is really short though so girls over 5'5 probably would have some difficulties keeping the top from slipping down. The bra wire comes out after a few washes.,0
5,"flattering, comfy and casual! just bought two more!",1
4,"LOL im a 36DD and it was kind of like a ‚Äúim pretty sure this wont work but lets try‚Äù type of thing. I was right. Its comical that i thought my boobs would just defy gravity. If you have A-C boobs, i would say you have a chance of this working. It looked 100% ridiculous on me and wouldnt do anything pasties couldnt do. The only way i could see it working for me is if the adhesive were all over the inside and the clear straps on the side also touched the side of the boob part of the bra too. Then.. maybe.  Still might be asking too much of physics. Four stars because its not the sellers fault. But they probably also shouldnt even hint that it could work for D boobs or bigger.",1
5,Es mi pulsera favorita . Recibo muchos cumplidos . La compr√© para completar un juego de rosas . Es realmente hermosa. Muy buena calidad,1
5,I bought it as a gift for my sister-n-law.  She loves it. Nice soft leather & just the right size.,1
1,Looked weird.<br />Almost like the K was upside down.,0
1,The velvet pouch was damaged as if something burned it. The key chain itself was not except a small scratch but I was very disappointed this product came this way.,0
4,Great fabric.  Material is not see through.  You don't need a slip.  The waistline  is above my waist.  Fits like an empire waist.  I'm 5ft 11/2 inches .  The dress drags the floor.  It's still too long with 4 in heels.  I would order a smaller size!,1
4,I love this product. A little thin Material and tight at first. But a wash or 2 they felt better. I love em! Stylish fit and look.,1
2,Not worth your money!! They hurt!!,0
3,I was not too impressed with this strap. Flimsier than I thought it would be. I replaced it with some more sturdy. Pretty and hoping to find another use for it.,0
5,"Recieved it quickly. Packaging was great. This dress is beautiful! I tried it on and my boyfriend and I were a little disappointed. The neckline was higher than expected. After 5 minutes, I realized I put it on backwards. After I turned it around, I showed my boyfriend and we both agreed that the dress was now perfect and I'm a true blonde. Lol. I got it in green. Not a color I would normally pick, but I love it. I'm 5'9 and it goes to the floor until I put on heels. Looks great with gladiator sandals. I give it 5 stars and I highly recommend it.",1
5,I love this set of necklace and earrings.  The color is bright and beautiful.  The chain is cute as well as the silver color is great with the color of the stone.  It turned out just as I had hoped.,1
2,There were no instructions on setting the watch.  Not easy to use.,0
5,"They fit just like ant pair of flip flops, I'm not disappointed in my purchase.",1
2,"As a watch enthusiast and collector, I'll own up to spending far more time than might be sensible scrolling and searching Amazon for bargains or interesting time pieces. It seems regardless of the focus of my searches, brands like OLEVS and OUPINKE (or OPK, TDO and JSDun ) tend to pop up in all the time with any number of representations of their ""luxurious attributes."" I decided to pick up a few samples from the aforementioned brands - which appear to be mushroom varieties from the same manufacturer -  to see for myself how well they hold up to the promotional come-ons.<br /><br />The accompanying photo reflects two watches from this manufacturer's stable: the blue sunburst dial styled OPK and a similarly styled OLEVS model. While the two minimalist watches have modest differences in hand styles, dial markers and different disappointing stainless steel bracelets, in terms of overall look and functionality, they're essentially consecutive slices of white bread. In each instance here, the hands and dotted markers are lumed although the longevity of illumination is less than sufficient.  If anything, the lighter weight OPK (69g) with the beads of rice plated band might be the least adequate of the six or so watches I acquired from this company for comparison purposes. The coated mesh bracelet employs a rattling stamped folding deployant clasp with two button release. For reasons that can only be speculated, this watch (as well as associated models from this concern) are shipped without crown retainers so it's a coin toss whether they'll be received with dead batteries or minimally, batteries that will have an inordinately reduced life span. All the these watches have snap off/on pressure closure stainless steel back case covers that is basically a consistent indicator of low end yet from the half full glass perspective, not much of an issue to replace if you have the appropriate cover replacement gadget.<br /><br />From a cursory glance many of these inexpensive models from each label seem relatively attractive and in numerable instances the only pertinent differences are the logos on the packaging and watch dials. On closer examination - let alone under magnification - most simply fail to pass muster even with consideration of the relatively low price point.  A few do not seem to be horrible and a waste of money at any price point and some potential purchasers may even consider these generally modest overall quality watches a good value. While all of them seem to employ arguably accurate lower end Japanese quartz movements which I suppose is the primary objective, nearly all of the quartz movement models I've acquired with a day/date complication are mired with misalignment issues in the date window. That said, I tend to believe these watches are of comparable quality to a host of popular designer branded watches employing effectively the same quality of materials but carrying substantially inflated retail prices.<br /><br />I cannot speak to how prevalent that deficiency is with the automatics or any of the models with the faux jewel dials and bezels because they are simply too gaudy for me to even have in my possession.Generally, there doesn't seem to be a major amount of differentiation between the OLEVS, OUPINKE, TDO or JSDun watches. No matter which branding you decide on it's probably a good idea just to avoid any of the purported stainless steel bracelets and opt for the arguably decent quality leather bands. While top surfaces of the links on the silver stainless steel bracelets are shiny and glimmering, I haven't found a single instance where the underside was commensurably finished. With the majority, the link end caps look dull not in the manner of a brushed finish but rather as though they were not buffed at all.<br /><br />However, if you do decide to be the intrepid explorer with the stainless steel, the ion plated or coated models seem to be of higher aesthetic quality the polished stainless steel. At least the coating tends to obviate some of the rattling...excluding the beads of rice models. Just don't go there at all. Similarly the black or antiqued gold tone cases are a less off-putting choice than the yellow gold tone or the silver cases which tend to appear plated substitutions for the actual metals or minerals.  The stainless steel cases might be a tolerable choice so long as it is not paired with one of the mediocre polished stainless steel bracelets where the end result is a watch that just shimmers CHEAP.",0
2,"Very weird fit. This looks more like pijamas which is how I‚Äôll end up using it. It has weird bulges where the pockets are, near the hip area. The material is somewhat awe through.",0
3,"I know that for $20 you‚Äôre only going to get so much watch. But you should know that this is not an automatic watch, as it‚Äôs described: ‚ÄúDescription -- Movement: Automatic Mechanical.‚Äù<br />It is a mechanical watch. It needs winding every day, unlike an automatic watch, which gathers power from small movements during the day.<br />I contacted the sellers, and they confirmed that it‚Äôs mechanical, not automatic.<br />Just sayin‚Äô.",0
5,"We tried all the bibs with our grandson. Smocks, fabric with plastic coating, all fabric. These are the BEST hands down. They wash up in a less than two minutes. They catch all the food and milk to save the high chair liner and floor. Hands down our favorite bibs!",1
5,"This necklace is gorgeous. I've only worn it once and I hope it doesn't break because it is very delicate, but I love it!",1
4,"I‚Äôm size 5 and these are too large. I wish socks brands will stop doing ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô solutions and start making a more diverse sizing.<br />It will be fair to say that all size 5-9 socks are large for me and they all pop up over my low shoes just like these do. The socks are good quality, they are thick and sporty and don‚Äôt fall off despite the sizing issue.",1
3,"They came very fast but when I received my item I was under the impression they were like the picture with dark lenses, the one I ordered came with clear lenses. I contacted the company and they immediately responded and were more then willing to replace the ones I had gotten. Unfortunately they were out of the ones I ordered with dark lenses but they were willing let me browse their store and pick another!  Great business!",0
3,"Cute, thick, warm, just too big for my infant son. I think I purchased this hat cause it stated it would stay put on INFANTS heads....it does not...annoying but guess he will grow into it...",0

5,This is very high quality! Thank you!,1
1,"The boots looked super nice but the quality of the boots is horrible, my son was trying them on and the outside side zipper broke and the inside zipper came off and now they can‚Äôt be used. Definitely not worth my money.",0
5,Bought these to wear when I am mowing grass.  Works well for that.. I find they are a little too tight and a little too hot.  It's likely I'll keep using them.,1

1,This suit felt so soft and comfortable but if you‚Äôre looking for any support there isn‚Äôt any,0
5,I really like these pants. They look and feel great. Only problem is the waist. There is no mechanism to tighten them. Not even belt loops. Since it is a sleek material it slides down easily. With any weight in the pockets they slide down. I fixed this by using a ratchet canvas belt. Even with that issue these pants are my favorite warm weather pants.,1
4,"Love the quality of the flowers, but would have given higher rating if they used alligator clips instead.  These clips tend to fall out a lot easier on fine hair.",1
1,Socks said they were delivered when they hadn't been. Finally arrived and are definitely not a one size fits all! Very much too small for the average built friend I was gifting these to. Disappointed!,0
2,"Eww! This shirt is NOT cotton! It says in the product description that this is a cotton poly blend. The label in the shirt says it's 80% cotton, 15% polyester, 5% spandex. My skin tells me it is 100% polyester and my eyes concur! After just one washing the fabric started to pill and socks and hair stick to it like fleece! Wearing it on a hot summer day makes you sweat! There is no way this shirt contains any cotton, let alone 80% of it! I machine washed and dried this, even though the label recommends professional dry cleaning (Its a t-shirt for heavens sake, no one is going to dry clean this!) it did not shrink a stitch and there was no color fading, again not possible with a cotton garment! It has a rubbery bounce and a clingy drape to it that is not found in natural fibers. It will highlight every bump, bulge and roll of back fat. It also hangs on the body in an unflattering way due to the weight of the fabric. Bottom line, David would not approve! Pass on this shirt, the manufacturer and and the seller can not be trusted!",0

5,"I am very pleased with this shirt. It is more of a hoodie than a sweatshirt, but I knew that when I bought it, because the description was clear. To give you an idea of how well this is constructed, my dog accidentally got ahold of the package when it was delivered, tore open the package, and dragged the shirt all over the muddy yard. I feared it was ruined, but after I washed it, you would never know it had been a tug toy for dogs. It is well-constructed and held together wonderfully. I would definitely buy again.",1
1,i thought it was gonna be cute to put in my resin molds but i didnt like any of the charms that came inside.,0
3,They‚Äôre ok. Not the best quality but ok especially if the kid likes these overpriced stuffed animals,0
5,love the colors and good quality,1
1,No me agrado la camisa por que viene con manchas,0
5,"Very pretty and light-weight, perfect for warm weather. I ordered pink, tan, and blue! Very nice and great price!",1

5,"The reason I first bought these earrings was for my secret Santa gift. I never realize how beautiful it was until I received it through the mail, and let me tell you how satisfied with how fast the delivery was to my home. When my secret Santa received her gift her eyes opened real big and she truly was blessed with the beauty of this jewelry. The Quality and the product it self was just magnificent. I for sure will continue to shop on amazon",1
5,"Very cute. Will be an Xmas gift for my daughter, think she will love it!",1
5,"I have worn glasses for over 50 years.  Constantly had to push them up, only to have them slide down again.  For the first time in my life, my glasses stay up.  It's WONDERFUL!",1
5,Very nice.,1
5,"I bought this outfit for a 15&#34; American Girl Bitty Baby doll. The t-shirt, pants and hat fit the doll perfectly. The sleeper was too long. I'm hoping it will shrink some in the wash.",1
1,"Absolutely way too small. I wear a 36C and typically order large and this large fit like a small. Even my husband said ‚Äúyou‚Äôd need a xxl to hold your boobs in with that‚Äù. Size up at least one, probably two. Also didn‚Äôt love the material.",0
5,Very plush,1
3,"This is one of the prettiest, soft and expensive looking and feeling sweaters I've ever bought, too bad it was so very small.  I also accidentally ordered 2 by mistake.  I read the reviews and sized up to med, but it was so very tight, no way I could have worn it. I'm 5'5, 110 , 38c if this can help someone else with sizing. I usually wear an xsmall and I purchased a medium. Ihope my exchange fits better.  This was my first time ordering Pattys' beautiful line.  I will replace it.  It's really very beautiful on. Figure flattering. Love the cuffs, long but won't get dirty like with thumb holes. This was a great idea especially if you use hand cream most of the day. I hate not giving 5 stars, but it's only because of the sizing up.  Beautiful on.!!This is a beautiful sweater on and will be warm for the winters here in VA.",0
2,There where to small,0
3,Fits a little bigger than I‚Äôd expected. I should‚Äôve ordered a large instead of x-large,0
1,Hard to put on and match up screw holes,0
5,Arrived very quickly and are more beautiful than pictured! Cannot wait to wear them!,1
5,"These are a perfect size for the trunk of my car, and seem to be well constructed and durable. They stand upright and have a solid placard to place in the bottom of the bag, and then fold up and lay flat when not in use. No more wrestling with flimsy shopping bags to get my groceries home. My wife and I have just returned from the grocery store and these shopping bags are the BEST!!! We loaded a few with very heavy items...canned veggies and liquid laundry detergent. I am very glad I ordered these bags! The extra reinforcement where the handles give me confidence when they‚Äôre loaded with groceries and they pair well with my insulated shopping bags that I bought from the same seller. They‚Äôre a great size for the cashiers‚Äô conveyor belt plus they stand upright as they move along. I felt so good because these are reusable so I don‚Äôt need to use plastic bags anymore! I washed them once in our washing machine without thinking and I thought they might be ruined but thankfully they held up well! My wife who uses them is small, so light durable bags are important, add to that the fact that they tuck away under the seat in my Jeep, hold a ton of stuff if she and I take the time to organize my groceries makes this purchase worth it.",1
4,Size was normal size. I had ordered the dusty pink but it is actual bright salmon. Definitely not the color pictured. Nice short but returned due to not color pictured,1
3, ,0
3,I love the ring.  It‚Äôs great.  It came to me already with some of its color missing.  The ring isn‚Äôt fully blue I‚Äôm the designs.  Otherwise it feel alright and isn‚Äôt too bad.,0
5,The fit my preschooler just fine. They'll protect his hearing while we're at Burning Man!,1
3,Comfortable to use it i love it.,0
2,"I don't know why it has good reviews. Ordered a 3xl, because I wear xl (5'10&#34; 210 lbs. size 15/16) and it fit my 10 year old neice. It is pretty and came with littleearrings for free, but i really am disappointed. I've ordered from China before and the sizes are iffy, but never this far off.",0
4,Cool üòé,1
5,Love these!  My son and I had a great time coloring. Nice and smooth,1
5,fits great looks great and its paintable i made it painted like black minerial fossils,1
2,It looks cheap. Lasted for a couple months before getting tears.,0
3,"This was a little misleading as it reads ""FunisFun Beer Mitten Gloves"" in the title, I ordered it and it is actually only one glove. The material is great and everything else was as described, just disappointed that it wasn't two gloves.",0
1,Chemical Smell. Runs small. I wear a Large in most pants...I couldn't even get these past my knees.,0
3,"This seems like it would be a great belt, but upon receipt I had my children try them on and they were WAY to small. I even measured them to make sure to get the correct size. I ordered the medium thinking they would have room to grow in them. My children measure 27 and 28 inches around the hips. The product description clearly states that it measures 30-32 inches. I will be returning these for an XL as I do feel they will work for us, just wish the sizes where correct so I didn't have to go through the return process and wait for the new product to arrive.",0
3,Cute shirt. Thicker material for fall weather,0
2,The fabric is stretchy but very thin!,0
1,"It arrived today. I just tried it on. As I zipped it, the zipper failed. Fabric is thin which is appropriate for spring and summer wear. However, it was advertised as loose leg but it was not.  The  thighs are narrow even though I sized up. I do not recommend this because of its poor quality and unpredictable sizing.",0
5,Great curler,1
5,Theses sunglasses are beautiful.  I have been watching them on another site and they were comparable on Amazon.  They come with the case and the cloth. Love them!,1
3,While this is sterling silver it should be noted that  this is NOT engraved. It is stamped or something else. I am considering returning this. I purchased as a gift and not sure the quality is there for a gift.,0
5,Cute backpack to use during the summer for ball games and beach runs. Great size with a lot of pockets. Love the navy blue color.,1
5,I am not a big fan of online clothes shopping but I am very very happy and pleasantly surprised by the quality and fitting of this product. It was well packaged and fit true to size. I ordered XL which is 38 Kurta size. Fitting is excellent and colors are vibrant. Well made. Neat and clean cuts. Not sure how it will be after wash  though.,1
5,Came a day later and was perfect thanks,1
5,This is a very nice jersey!  My son loves it!,1
1,"I took some time before buying this watch. I was going to have surgery soon on my right hand and wrist. March 2017. I needed a watch to be able to see the time.<br /> I took care of and wound this mechanical watch as stated on their Amazon site instructions. I did not use it every single day  because of the surgery. Yet, when I did I made sure I did it with care. I loved to watch the mechanics go back-and-forth with-in this pocket watch.<br /> On April 22nd  my beloved watch stopped working.<br /> I should have taken into the account of what other people had stated in their reviews. No instructions in the box only on Amazon site.<br /> Yet, most of all  I saw some reviews that told me that this had happened to you them.<br /> I'm getting married later on this year and was hoping that this watch would workout and I would give one to my groomsman.",0
4,"I've worn this hat on and off for two winters, and it is adorable. The fit is excellent, and I can wrap the long mitten trails around my neck as a scarf or tuck them in to my coat as an extra layer of warmth.<br /><br />I deducted one star because I am afraid the fur will get all messed up in the wash (or in really wet weather). It is definitely not dryer safe, but that is okay, just an FYI. Also the ears could have been constructed a little better, but it is still cute and cuddly all the way 'round.",1
1,"Does not play in our player, the format is not accepted",0
5,good,1
5,ordeed another pair for sister,1
4,Pink stripe doesn‚Äôt go all the way around the back which I don‚Äôt know if I would of bought it if I had known. Still super cute. Light weight. Perfect for spring. Nice soft material. Could sleep in it it‚Äôs so thin and comfortable.<br /><br />Order a size up unless you like it a little form fitting. It does stretch but isn‚Äôt real forgiving when you‚Äôre on the chubby side :),1
5,"Great fitting pants with a thicker, stretchy fabric. These wash really well with very little shrinkage, and they pack and travel well. A new favorite for business casual. Sizing seems to run a bit larger, size down one size for a better fit. I normally wear a 4 and the size 2 is a little looser fitting. The waist seems a bit larger and lower in rise than most ankle pants.",1
1,This is very see thru. I'm terrified to wear this out anywhere.....,0
2,"As any plain old jacket, sure it's average and does the job.  As a travel jacket, I would think some things are pretty necessary and go without saying.  Secure inner pockets, a cinch to protect things in the inner pockets, etc.  While the outer pockets have a flap over them, the inner pockets have no protection (zipper) to secure items.  One pocket (for phone) has a small velcro but it also barely fits many of today's phones.  Anything larger than a 5 inch or so phone does not fit or fits very tightly.  My Galaxy S7 fit just barely.  A word of caution on sizes: I normally wear large.  Their large was a bit too small, and the XL was way too large.  Material is decent, color is nice.<br /><br />Overall, as a run-of-the-mill jacket, I would say three stars with little expectations and a missing cinch at the bottom.  However, this is advertised as a travel jacket, so I would say two stars for the lack of thinking it all the way through.  Just my thoughts!",0
2,No comment,0
5,"What a great coat! Not too thin, not to thick and very long. Perfect for a dreary, wet and raw New York winter. The hood fits perfectly and there are lots of pockets, zippers and zelcro. Runs large.",1
1,Cheap manufacture. Broke within 24 hours of receiving.,0
5,My order was described perfectly and arrived at my door sooner than expected... Absolutely beautiful necklace!,1
5,Color and fit as advertised.,1
1,Terrible. Why would anyone even make them? Would have gave them to my granddaughter but did not want her ears to get infected. A penny + shipping and handling is way to much for these.,0
5,I do not like that it has no outside front pockets,1
1,Cheap dont waste ur money,0
3,"I saw this on an influencer and thought it would be the perfect sweet little romper for this mama. I love the pattern and could see it being great for summer and fall. The shorts were longer and a good conservative length. Unfortunately, the fabric was extremely see through, and the top was very low cut. I would have had to wear a tank under it which would have just made the bottoms more obviously see through. Sadly, I returned it.",0
5,"Fun, excellent pattern on quality lightweight fabric. Very versatile.",1
1,"This item is a good value at $.01, but shipping should be less?",0
5,"Absolutely great hat, love it!",1
4,"Fit on these is spot on, although the sole is extremely flat so if you plan on walking around a lot/dancing in them, i suggest getting some shoe inserts. The remote works best at close range (if you put it a few inches away from the bottom, pointing towards the bottom it works the best). Mine came with an extra remote and extra charging cord as well. the remote only changes one shoe color at a time though which could be a good thing or a bad thing. not sure why a shoe horn was included since usually you dont need one to put on lace up sneakers, but im happy i have one now to use with my other shoes. overall im happy with my purchase",1
2,The dress was too wide in the shoulder area,0
2,Nice medallion but chain to short.,0
4,IT's very nice necklace. .. But it's a little bit small. If it's a gift for your daughter it's really good!,1
3,"Nice item, good quality. But white material had pink hue.",0
5,"super cute, fits very well inside of smaller purses, love it!",1
4,"Although I found the sizing to be too small , the construction seemed pretty solid and the fabric was comfortable.",1
1,Size is off. Doesn't allow returns!,0
5,My daughter loved it. Great quality. Fast shipping.,1
5,"I‚Äôve tried a lot of stretch bands and I like these the best. They hold up really well and they don‚Äôt irritate my wrists. Sometimes the part that clips to the watch can break, but that is probably after a year of use. I get these all the time and don‚Äôt have any complaints.",1
5,Really works,1
2,"Bad quality  - pitted stainless steel, bad time keeping",0
1,Shoddy and WAY too short.,0
5,Works great when polishing my silver necklaces and earrings.,1
4,love this piece,1
1,I thought the clothes were misses sizes they look like very small junior sizes.  I gave my items to my granddaughters,0
5,"These shorts are Quality with a capital Q. Chose the blue and green.  Fabric is great- soft, thicker than some shorts, and stretchable. Yet, it is breathable which is important as a Southwest desert dweller.  The waistband is wide with elastic and has a draw string.  They stay put.  They are hand wash and line dry recommended on label.  Ordered small and they fit perfect with plenty of room.  I will definitely order more in the spring.",1
3,The material it's  ok but with the time it gets a bit loose it runs a bit large than I expected but it's just ok,0
5,I purchased this  Cap for 6 years old. It has adjustable clip on the back which worked great. I am also happy with a quality of the product.,1
5,Very fast delivery and great quality,1
4,Same as picture,1
5,Child love the shoes,1
1,These glasses are okay.. I ordered the brown ones and you can see my eyes. I was hoping they would be a little bit darker so I don‚Äôt wear them.,0
5,My son loves this!! He got it a month ago and still carries it around everywhere. It is great material!!,1
5,"Fit as expected. We'll made. Not so much stretch as in other brands, so not as form fitting. Comfortable.",1
3,Really liked this but too small.,0
3,"I am 5‚Äù2 and 111 lbs- 26 inch waist, hips about 37 inches- size small was way too small- literally ‚Äúsquished‚Äù my ass and gave me a pancake butt. They are cut completely the same from front to back- so they do not allow any room in the butt department (I don‚Äôt even have a big butt). They are not see through and are okay for squats- but the tightness made them uncomfortable for squatting for me. Probably size medium would have worked better.",0
4,"Nice top. But a tight fit, definitely order a size or 2 larger than what you wear. Runs small. Other than the size issue it's a nice top.",1
5,Okay so I bought these for Christmas box for a 2 yr. old child and I'm hoping he loves them as much and I loved shopping for him. Everything was in working order when I received them I was very pleased.,1
3,good looking,0
1,The mondor dress is good quality but the vendor makes you pay for shipping on return / exchange products which not clearly stated on their website. The dress runs very small size.,0
1,Seemed durable when I received and opened. 2 weeks later the spring shot out of it and the metal clasp fell out. It is now worthless.,0
1,Large is more like an extra large. Sleeves too long. Length ok. Was very disappointed.,0
2,This sweater wasn't what I expected the quality in all honesty could be better for the price. I ordered a medium but the tag on the sweater says XL so the sizes are way off. The zipper is plastic and looks like it can break easily. It also smelled funny so it would definitely need to be washed before wearing but it has no care instructions as far as how it should be washed and if it can be dried like most clothes do. It was purchased as a gift and the reaction will determine if I return it or not.,0
1,"I Really dislike polyester especially for a t-shirt. I read the description and therefore wasn't expecting a premium product, but the way it hangs is not flattering.  In the photo it appears the sleeves are shorter like most women's t-shirts, and these are not. They're to long for my liking. The shirt is very thin so a bra visible. I dislike this tee so much I can't even wear this shirt to bed. Also, The print isn't very colorful as well.",0
5,Fast delivery. Very happy with the product!,1
5,"good quality, easy to carry",1
4,"I'm 5'2, 125, size 4/6 in jeans so I ordered a 4/6 in these pants. Everything fit great except the elastic around the waist was too tight, so it was unflattering. I returned them bc I didn't have time to fix myself but I suppose if the elastic was replaced with a ribbon or string they would fit better. Otherwise, they look just as pictured!",1
3,"Colors in the pictures are misleading. I purchased the purple/green color combo and it's not even close to the pictures, they are actually purple and gold with just a tiny hint of green. That said, they do fit me well and they are lightweight, really comfortable.",0
2,"Does not change tint in any light.<br />However, provides polarization and is helpful in low light and weather. The opening for the nose is rather narrow, so if your nose is not child sized these may ride higher than one would hope.",0
1,"white the fabric is beautiful and the skirt fit almost too large, the top, which I measured for prior to ordering does not close the way it does in the photo and is so revealing, I couldn't wear this anywhere. I am sadly disappointed with the sellers sizing charts as well as their product. One item fitting large the other piece too small. AFTER I measured according to guidelines. THIS is the type of thing that should get you kicked off of Amazon because it causes people to NEVER EVER want to order clothing because the sizing is so screwed up and often misrepresented as in this scenario. .",0
5,I like it. It's a little small/tight for hiking but I tried it river rafting and it was perfect.,1
5,great,1
5,It was perfect for my 9yr old.,1
3,"I'm 5'3 and 150 lbs and I ordered a medium. It fits great and is comfortable,  but the material faded after the first wash. I was very disappointed since I loved everything else about it.",0
5,perfect,1
5,"I just received this beautiful bracelet in the mail today! I am so pleased! The silver is heavy, the bracelet is bright and shiny, well made and is going to be a perfect stocking stuffer for one of my three adult daughters! I've recently discovered this gifted jewelry designer, and am extremely impressed by his attention to detail, his craftsmenship, and his art. Have long been a fan of beautiful heavy silver work, and thought it had gone by the wayside as most jewelry has due to cost prohibitiveness. Am so very happy to see that in this instance it is not the case. Have ordered 4 pieces for gifts, 3 from a local boutique and 1 from this site, and am thinking I need to order another of these for myself! Happy Holidays and Thank you for your art Mr. Shahar!",1
3,Bought a set of two so I could switch the horns but had to deal with a stripped screw. Got what I wanted at the end of the day but had to jump thru a few hoops.,0
1,They don't work. Don't purchase not worth it,0
3,"Material was that shiny stuff they use for athletic, rip away pants. Otherwise cool but not what I wanted. Returned them.",0
4,Love these bands<br />But it is showing signs of Ware and they started after a few weeks,1
5,This dress fits just right and does not cling to meüòâ,1
1,"Cheap looking, smaller then expected and had a chemical smell to it",0
3,Very bendy,0
5,My wrist always sweats with the rubber watch bands but not with this one.. you can wear it dressed up or casual.. really nice!!,1
5,Very pretty and petite. Highly recommend,1
5,Myself for Christmas,1
5,Awesome leggings- so comfortable and love the colors too.,1
1,"I bought this blouse, thinking it would be light material to wear in warm weather. It was not.",0
2,"I have gotten several pairs of these pants over the years.  My only complaint is that they are not consistent with sizing -- usually in length.  In this case, the waist was over an inch smaller than the size.  Sent them back...",0
1,"Terrible quality fabric- basically felt like tissue paper. Also very thin. The lace was not white, but instead off white which made it look dingy.",0
1,"Cheap belt, it fell apart after 3 wears",0
1,"So disappointed.  I bought this for a hardsided suitcase that didn't lock anymore.  My friend and I each bought one.  We both had difficulty figuring out how to use it as the instructions were unclear.  I am usually good at figuring things out, so it took me a while but I finally did it, no thanks to the instructions.  Apparently, on the return flight, some knucklehead baggage handler used the strap to grab the heavy suitcase and it broke at the plastic cross piece.  I can't recommend this product.",0
1,Actually made the watch run faster!,0
1,"This fits like a tent. I am 5'3 and 150 lbs and wear an XL and this thing is HUGE. It goes almost to my knees. I would wear it as a dress, but it fits like a pillowcase! There is no pretty ruffling like in the picture.The fabric has a flat tee shirt feel to it and isn't soft at all. It you are buying this for a maternity shirt then buy two sizes smaller then you normally wear and it MIGHT work.",0
4,I love this; only reason for not giving 5 stars is it frayed upon washing.  However that could have been prevented if I hand washed- so probably a user error!,1
5,"I love this bracelet.  The only problem is, I have some expensive bracelets just sitting in my jewelry box now because I've been wearing this every single day since I received it!  The picture just doesn't do it complete justice!",1
3,"They don't actually come all the way to the knee, more like mid thigh.",0
2,They were cute until the bottom rim broke the second time I put them on. Super flimsy.,0
2,"The item was delivered with one side removed, but still in bag. Packaged was not damaged.",0
1,Terrible quality,0
1,"Not only are these not waterproof, they seem to absorb water and transfer it directly into your shoes. Worse, they take forever to dry. Good for maybe 5 minutes of light rain and then you might as well stick your feet, socks and shoes in a bucket of water. Total trash.",0
5,I love these belts and since I found them they are now my only belts. I have bought additional ones as gifts. I love this deal with all the different colors to go with whatever I wear.,1
3,2nd pair in one season for my son who is 4. The Velcro did not hold up. Otherwise great for the price.,0
5,"Nice soft cotton brief that stretch, love these, great price and great value.",1
1,I hated everything about this shirt. It looks nothing like the picture and the fabric is horrible. It looks like a pajama shirt instead of a sweater.,0
5,Perfect mask for Easter ..,1
5,These are so pretty and so delicate looking perfect for a little girl.,1
3,"I just received the watch band and it‚Äôs a decent band for the price.  The packaging was nicely done and tools to adjust the band were included.  However, the directions were not.  The links are painted and was chipped a little when I opened the box.  The rose gold is not a true rosy color as described.  The finish is too shiny and shows fingerprints and smudges.  From a distance it‚Äôs a decent band but definitely not for everyday wear.",0
5,"I'm very happy with this shirt.  It's cool and comfortable and perfect for summer.  The texture makes it unique and not another run-of-the-mill top.  Washing and drying is also easy, and the top doesn't wrinkle.  I'm very happy with this.",1
5,"I love this dress! It's really comfortable. I like to wear it with a chambray shirt knotted in the front. Every time I wear it, I get several compliments.",1
4,"we're talking shoelaces, not shoes",1
5,"There's a lot of fabric in the ""skirt"" area and the straps can get a bit confusing, but it's REALLY cute! The fit is great, especially for us short girls.",1
3,"Very pretty bag! Nice dual color tone. Decorative hardware is cheap junk. Kept coming apart. I finally gave up trying to keep it all together. Interior compartments have some shoddy sewing, ie unfinished edge.",0
5,Purchase this for my father and it works very well. It feels soft to the touch and it is washable.,1
3,Fits the glasses<br />Pads are to small for the size of my frames<br />Locks into the frame no cushion,0
4,The skirt is cute but totally see through. It's just made of tool and my daughter will have to wear a pair of shorts underneath it. But it is colorful though. I just thought it had its own lining underneath it. The company knew I wasn't necessarily satisfied with it and they absolutely wonderful to work with.,1
5,My mother In Law Loved it. It dances gently and sparkles differently in varying lights.,1
1,Didn't work,0
5,very good and nice watch,1
3,Very pretty. A little smaller than anticipated! But pretty!,0
5,"These are the most comfortable cycling shoes I've owned and are decent for walking in.  There was no break-in required and the 3 straps give a great customize fit with easy on-off.  The look of the shoe is just ok, but that's just my opinion. The biggest issue is these run small.  I normally wear a 44 but the 45 fits perfect.  I tried on a lot of shoes from Giro, Shimano, and Specialized and in general Giros ran large (needed a 43), Specialized ran normal (needed a 44), and Shimano (needed a 45).",1
1,The black one is very scratchy and uncomfortable. Lots of loose threads that might be prone to fraying. It's a shame because the style is very cute.,0
5,Great product!,1
5,Nice I like it,1
5,"If you have lots of small electronic gadgetry, this will keep it secure. I know, I used it when I traveled to Europe. All things came through flawlessly.",1
5,I luv these little slippers. I have a pair for my early morning rise and a pair at my desk in my office. I will definitely order more soon!,1
1,"I have a 33 waist and purchased the 34"" waist... Must be mis marked as it was difficult to pull up and impossible to button.  Zipper is too short.  Have to return.  This must a have been a 30"" pair marked as 34"".  Nice material but unfortunately does not fit me.",0
5,She loved these...and wanted to buy more for her friends! They are super cute and very vintage like! Def recommend,1
4,"I really had to give some thought in how to rate this top. If you order your regular size then the top might be a bit more form-fitting than you see on the model. It's one that I personally won't wear unless I have some type of compression cami or spanx underneath it. At my regular size it clings to every nook and cranny it can find. For me, this top isn't flattering at all. It does have a nice feel to it and you can tell it's a good quality top, however, I don't (yet) have the body to pull this one off. Don't get me wrong, I wear quite a lot of fitted tops, this one just doesn't hit in the right spots. So like I said, I had a hard time rating it; it doesn't work for me, but it could definitely be a great top for someone else. I'd recommend sizing up if you want it to fit like it is on that model in the picture, otherwise it'll probably be more fitted than you like, too.",1
3,The straps are NOT adjustable but they are stretchy. Too stretchy in my opinion. You want stretchy but you also want the top to stay in place. That's why I gave the star rating I did.,0
5,"Great quality, sized perfect, and absolutely beautiful",1
5,Beautiful piece.,1
3,"It's odd to say that something so tiny is too large, but you have to tie knots in weird places to make this thing fit.  It looks nice from the front once you figure it out, but I needed help from a friend getting it tied off in the back, and then it didn't want to stay in place very well.  There are several similar swimsuits that work better at the same price. Follow the link in my profile to see me trying to wear it.",0
5,"This Loose Tunic is very comfortable.<br />Soft, beautiful color, and easy to wash.<br />A little see-through depending on the color I have a yellow one.<br />Also, the SIZE is a little bigger than I was expecting, special on the neck.<br />I had to sew on the neckline on both sides and it's good now.",1
3,"FYI I thought by the pic it was an outside close snap, it turns out to be a velcro closure. I did not know that.",0
2,This product looks cheap and cheesy. It doesn‚Äôt fit well. Would not recommend.,0
5,"Overall, I decided to keep and wear the dress. I wanted something oversized, roomy, and cotton. I also wanted it to be longer on me. I should have inquired more about the material. I wanted to get a vinyl print on it for the summer and use it as a beach coverup. I did use it as a coverup in the end. I love the pockets. The material is def more of a rayon and not meant for a heat press vinyl to be attached. It fit me and not snug. I'm a 2xl size 20-22 waist and tummy. I just wasn't expecting the material to be that clingy and stretchy feeling. Also, the neck is way higher than pictured. I kept pulling down on it trying to stretch it away from my neck.",1
1,"Pants do not fit at all. Waist was slightly tight, and legs barely fit in. Legs extended so long I could cover my feet.",0
1,I got this the fit is well but the train was seeen in the front and not in back!,0
1,It was perfect for me.,0
4,"I thought this would be small clutch-sized. In reality, it‚Äôs very large, more like a small purse. Besides that, I really liked the color and the style.",1
2,It is see through and the color is not accurate.,0
2,"I bought these right before Xmas cause we were getting a cold front.  I wore them one day. It was our first major snow storm.  My hands were dry, but cold as the dickens.",0
5,It‚Äôs comfy with the perfect amount of stretch without being too stretchy.  The buckle actually sits more flush than I thought it would!  Seems to be pretty durable and has a classic look to it.  Just wish it had quick release pins built in somehow.,1
5,"We haven‚Äôt washed it yet, can‚Äôt review as to how it holds up to washings.  It‚Äôs a very cute dress, my niece loved it.",1
5,I wanted something light weight for playing drums. Doesn't get might lighter and more comfortable than this. Definitely more suitable for smaller wrists though. It looks small on me.,1
4,order a size up,1
2,too small and made cheaply.,0
4,"It did cling to me quite a bit when i tried it on, that could be because I hadn't washed it yet. I will be trying it on again for a function and will edit my review if anything new arises",1
2,The large was a small I sent it back,0
1,So its okay to lie and say they are new when they were actually used??? Do not waste your money on these shoes. They were dirty and the leather was broken like they have been used.,0
4,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful and so well made. I really like it. But it's way too small and fits only average sized wrist with comfort. My hubs wrist is thicker than average. Although he was able to fasten it, it was way too tight for comfort. But for smaller wrists I totally recommend. It's a bada$$ bracelet, very stylish and has bad boy vibe to it.",1
1,I don't know why the provided chart is totally different from the real sizes... I ordered an xl based on the comments I have read and it was so short!!! Do not recommend buying it...,0
5,Super see through but I just wore spanks underneath.,1
5,Beautiful,1
1,Hat arrived bent out of shape and has not regained proper shape no matter how much it is worn. Don't waste your time/money.,0
5,I received many compliments on this. It was easy to wear and festive.,1
5,Beautiful color and texture. I never had the pleasure to wear it: my 21 yo daughter immediately stole it and she loves it,1
2,"Not impressed at all. Like another reviewer, these are NOT ankle socks as I had hoped, nor are they all cotton.  Yes, they do have cotton in them but they also have acrylic and spandex. There isn't a cuff at all & the top of the sock cuts in deeply. Would NOT recommend these to anyone with any kind of leg/ankle circulation issues. Not really sure what the &#34;cute animal&#34; is on the gray pair or any other pair!! These were not what I had hoped or expected. Very disappointed!!",0
3,Sexy dress not doubt however not for everybody. Runs like a medium/large size.,0
5,My son loves how warm and soft this robe is.  Very nice gift and price.  Would purchase again.,1
2,It‚Äôs ok not great just ok,0
5,Great glasses,1
3,Heavy material but poor button. Both broke first night,0
5,"Fits pretty snug for a size 14. Was hoping for just a tad more room, but it'll be alright. A 15 would be much too large, even if they exist.",1
5,love these! They are so stylish and the look amazing! no one can tell they are off brand and they are pretty durable!,1
5,These glass are great for style at a great price. Semi sturdy but good for a day out at kids games or by the pool.,1
5,"I have a pair in beige, very comfortable.  I really want a pair in black but need size 7.5. They must run small because I wear a 6.5 or 7. Love them.",1
1,"I purchased my normal size and it was huge. I am too heavy and it was just sagging in the front. The material is ok, a little itchy. I wish those glitter circles weren‚Äôt even on the dress. Makes it look cheap.",0
5,Little thin but it fits as expected. It's soft and comfortable. Goes great with my leggings.,1
1,"The mask seemed stiff, not at all comfortable, and the ear loops were just plain uncomfortable regular elastic like I use in sewing - like I used in the first masks I made before I found there were other softer and more comfortable options for ear loops. My husband won't wear it (it was intended for him), and neither will I. There are better options available.",0
5,I have had so many great comments on these earrings. They are so cute and lightweight. Love them.,1
5,I've been wearing Dri Duck caps for several years.  My nephew gave me a few caps with his company logo on the front.  They are comfortable to wear and hold up to hard work and sweat.  The bill also holds together wash after wash in the washing machine or just soaking in the sink.  I highly recommend trying Dri Duck caps to anyone.,1
5,My son's best friend birthday gift. He loved them! They are Minecraft geek's!!,1
1,Does the word Tacky . The post were so long they came thru the back of the PKG..,0
1,Shirt looks nothing like what I ordered. It has slits down the sides of the arms & bunched. Picture shows lose fitting tee with peek aboo holes. Very disappointed!!!!,0
1,Why did I order a green and black coat & receive a green and black coat with colorful pockets with flags and stuff in it as if they ran out of material! Unacceptable!,0
5,I love this face mask. It‚Äôs so cute and stylish. The material is nice too and breathable.,1
2,"The sizing of the skirt was off, rendering it unwearable by anyone in my home. The top fit a DD just fine.",0
3,I really liked the dress,0
5,Had to send back I needed to buy the extra small but otherwise perfect product,1
4,"Okay, so these things are warm. VERY WARM, but not too much to make your hands sweat. In 35 degree weather, i didnt feel ANY cold, and with the wind chill factor again, nothing. Simply warm! the stitching on the velcro on BOTH gloves is already coming apart after about 1 hour use (only using the mittens like 3 times) but the stitching on everything else seems to be fine! I would recommend these to anyone who wants COMFY warm gloves.",1
5,The perfect leggings. Good bye jiggle ;),1
5,Loved it.  I wore it the next day and received several compliments of the necklace.<br /><br />Thanks much,1
1,"This thing is ill fitting, super baggy. Looks like a robe/housecoat. Plus the seller charges for<br />Returns.",0
3,Low quality zipper on the wrong side but its,0
5,"I wanted something to keep my face warm during my outdoor walks this winter. I chose this color so it would been seen by oncoming traffic. The orange color is very bright, and the scarf itself is well made and warm. I plan on buying another one in a more appropriate ‚ÄúUniversity of Kentucky‚Äù blue color. ;)",1
5,my daughter love it,1
5,These are friggen awesome,1
3,"The belt looks nice and isn't small. The material, though, is pretty stiff, and as a result the buckle can loosen unless there's a fair bit of tension on it, more than is comfortable for a belt. Also the buckle is quite large, so makes a big bump under your shirt.",0
5,"Very pretty and the price was amazing. It was way too big for my wrist, but it was easily adjusted by removing the extra links which took about 5 seconds. I 100 percent recommend this band to dress up your watch! I love it!",1
1,"the strings around waist hardened after i took out of dryer, like a stiff board shorts fit excellent but the strings must be made of some sort of plastic for this to happen,,,",0
4,"Fit as expected, a little bit wide though. Not a big deal. Not sure if it'll hold up many washes",1
1,"The bra fits but the crossover is about two sizes too small, has no stretch and won‚Äôt fasten. Had to give it to someone two sizes smaller than me.",0
1,"It fit for the most part, but was right around the top a little and you can tell the bottom is cheaply made. Ya get what you pay for üòÖ I guess. The bottom ripped from the top after just a few hours of wearing it.",0
5,Love it!!,1
5,Seriously a great pair of shoes for my little one! she's 6 months but her feet are on the smaller side and I was really worried that these would be huge on her just like every other 0-3 shoes out there but I risked it and ordered it and they were perfect on her!!! and the quality omg is amazing! feels like real leather and very well made. Im very pleased with this product and the price is just wow!,1
1,too small never received the grey,0
4,Great price and cute shoe!,1
3,"Cute necklace.  Although,  I can't really read the lettering on the leaves. Metal on chain makes my skin breakout too.",0
5,Really cute,1
2,The leather feels really cheap and hard. I returned the band the next day.<br /><br />update 5/11/17 - Customer Support has reached out to me to see if any of their other products would be a better fit. From 1 to 2 stars for their support service.,0
3,"I wear a 38 C and I bought the largest size they sold. The criss cross material on the chest was tight and felt to thick to wear for too long. Also the band was tight. Not much support at all. If you have a smaller chest size, this probably would work for you.",0
1,Too small it didn't fit. I wished the site ha an  option to select the size but it didn't.,0
5,I really should be getting a commission helping sell these glasses. I've had no fewer than ten people ask about them after seeing me toss them around in the river and watching them float until I grab them again.<br /><br />They're light. They're incredibly comfortable. They're polarized. They're fashionable even for a guy with a weird shaped head and is super picky about glasses.<br /><br />I can see the sandbars underwater. The polarized shades do an excellent job keeping any glare to an absolute minimum. I forget I have them on and how bright the world is when I take them off.<br /><br />I love love love these glasses and I bought a second pair to prove it.,1
5,Absolutely the coolest looking ring!  This is a Durable and classy looking ring that I love.  Fabulous man gift if they like rings,1
1,Very cheap looking,0
5,pretty !,1
5,Great materials. Great arch support. Great comfort. Great style. Just an all around great pair of sandals that fit really well. Best flip-flops I have ever owned and will buy again in the future.,1
2, ,0
1,"This thing is ridiculous. First of all the material is pathetically cheap and shiny. It‚Äôs gross. Also, if you‚Äôre at all long waisted it‚Äôs not gonna work. Don‚Äôt buy it.",0
2,"Ended up buying and returning this twice. They look nice, but are VERY translucent. They also run small so I thought if they weren't tight it would be better. However, it doesn't matter how loose it hung, it was still see-through. So would be great for someone who likes translucent shirts or wants to layer it, but it wasn't what I was looking for or needed.",0
3,Good,0
2,Tip broke off and I can't even find the broken piece.,0
1,The shirt that was delivered is NOT an Alpinestars T- shirt. It's also poorly screened and is not what is depicted in the advertising photo.,0
1,This dress looks nothing like the picture and runs small. Cheap Quality. The customer service is horrible and they kept trying to persuade me to keep the dress and give it as a gift in lieu of a full refund.,0
1,Way too small,0
5,"My son purchased these for playing baseball.  They look good - darker red than appeared in the advertising photo, and block the sun without being to dark.",1
2,I had to return this because the fit was nowhere near as described. This was entirely too tight. Looked cute but no good in the fit particularly in the chest area.,0
5,I liked how elegant it looked for the price. I had to get this dress as a quick wedding dress because the virus hit and all my plans changed. So we had an intimate wedding ceremony with this dress. It was PERFECT,1
2,"Looks and feels great. Takes some adjustments. I recommend two glasses size screwdrivers. Fits my Luminox 3050/3950<br /><br />Update:<br />The rubber on the band will break in under a year. The band was worn everyday under normal use conditions. Repaired one broken link, and another broke shortly after.",0
1,"Ordered a large because that‚Äôs typically what my 13 year old wears, way too small. Returned and got an XL, still too small. Not going to attempt to try again. The second set of shirts also had a lot of fray going on. Even if they‚Äôd fit I‚Äôd still return them for not being good quality.",0
1,Received an empty box.,0
2,Does not fit the same as the three others I purchased. Material feels different & not as forgiving.,0
2,The item ran extremely small.,0
5,Great quality hoops.,1
5,Very satisfied,1
1,It was smaller than expected,0
3,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 175 lbs, it was much shorter on me than expected. I do like it and have been wearing it as a tunic top. It fits baggy, but only just covers my butt.",0
5,"Great purchase! Love, Love, Love the watch band! It arrived so fast!",1
1,I like the frames for my face. But I can only see infinite the middle of the lens. I can't see to either side or looking down. Everything is  complete blur. I'd  broke my old glasses.  So I have no choice. Until I get more. I strongly don't recommend.,0
3,"did the job, thes.e skirts are built with cheep material a summer choice you will need a slip",0
5,"I actually really like this jacket. It's lightweight and 95% cotton which is what I was looking for. I wanted to get a parka style jacket that also wouldn't be too overpriced. This one fit the bill. I would suggest though washing it then going over it with an iron because it arrives very wrinkled and doesn't look as cute. Also, I typically wear a large but went with a medium as other reviews suggested.",1
1,"First, the colors of the mask I was sent were not as red and blue as one that was shown. Also, wearing this mask for more than a short time was not comfortable as in breathing in and out, maybe it was my fault for not looking at what type of material this was made out of, but all my other fabric mask have been fine.",0
1,Material feels extremely cheap. I do not recommend.,0
5,I LOVE IT!!! It is beautiful!!,1
3,"These run a bit long. I'm 5'4&#34; and the Large was entirely too long for me. I suspect a small would perhaps have been the right length, but that's never going to happen :)",0
5,This apron is awesome. Fits good and washes up great.,1
5,Husband loves it,1
3,ok,0
5,I love the Fly London Brand! I get so many compliments on these shoes! They are quite lovely!,1
5,"Love this shirt. It‚Äôs really not great for working out in but definitely comfortable. It‚Äôs definitely stylish, it‚Äôs a good product",1
4,more of a yellow green color but very cute.,1
5,Enjoy them,1
1,Christmas present for my daughter and first day a stone fell out. Don't want a refund would like a exchange,0
1,there was advertised with wire nose. Thats not true there any all cloth.,0
3,"This dress is super cute and as pictured, but the material is paper thin. The back bow is short and hard to tie, it'll come loose easily and the chest part is slightly big for B cup breasts.",0
1,They are too difficult to attach.,0
5,This works so well and your purse is out of the way. Or not on the back of a chair out of eye sight.,1
4,"These hands are very creepy and fit me well. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the palms are open. Other than that, they're perfect!",1
5,Me encant√≥!,1
1,I bought this product and not even a month later the clasp that keeps the wallet closed no longer works. I would not recommend buying this product.,0
2,"Terrible fit, I got a size up and it was still about three sizes too small",0
2,"As a girl with a big belly. I‚Äôm about an XL but like to buy 2XL for more loose comfortable fitting. Let me tell you, this wasn‚Äôt it. At 5‚Äù7 I already knew the length was ridiculous short and it was tighter in the torso. It felt like a shirt. Not good material either.",0
1,The is not for big boys.,0
4,"I want to like these, but quite honestly I‚Äôm a bit nervous to wear these out to the gym. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 28 waist and 34 hips. Size 6 pants small leggings. I ordered my normal size small. I feel like they fit a bit big through the waist and hips. I know they‚Äôre joggers, but I feel like compared to how the legs fit the hips should be less baggy. The material is like yoga or athletic leggings, comfy and buttery to the touch. They fit alright, but I think it‚Äôs the color that‚Äôs throwing me off. I love the color itself, but because it‚Äôs so light it‚Äôs not very forgiving and shows my lumps and bumps on the backside. And that‚Äôs in my dim bedroom light. Maybe I‚Äôll try them jogging outside  or on an upper body gym day if Ifs not crowded... but I think I should have ordered a darker color because of my backside imperfections.",1
3,"Glad I ordered a larger size to fit my 8 year old, otherwise they would not fit.",0
5,The zippers slide easily and the size is perfect.,1
3,This is  nice and simple  .Plenty space inside.<br /> I don't like the joining of material in the middle at the back.  It makes my expensive bag look cheap,0
1,"While the Leather Key Chain looks good and seems to have high quality leather, The design is poorly thought out, at least for an Infinity Key Fob. The Key fob does not fit within the leather holder. At least 30% of the key fob is exposed. Completely unusable. Ordered and waiting for the iJDMTOY leather remote for smart key fob as a replacement. Fingers Crossed....",0
1,Had it like three weeks and it broke.,0
5,These leg warmers are just what I was looking for. I love' 'em!,1
5,Retro. Very classy,1
3,They fit around my waist just wish they were a little higher waisted because they won‚Äôt stay up. But it could just be my shape. Shipping was good. The item was what it was described as,0
5,"It's a very pretty piece of jewelry, simply made, but pretty. I purchased it for my oldest daughter, and it looked stunning on her; then again everything looks stunning on her.",1
5,Love the cuff  arrived fast,1
5,I love this shirt! Super comfy! True to size and very breathable üëçüèΩ,1
1,Did not look as good in reality. Cheap. Color off,0
3,I received the black/white pattern which was more of a cream/yellow than white. üòî,0
4,Long but still fit good.,1
5,Elegant and got many compliments for this!,1
2,no support,0
2,Wore it and noticed anything or anyone I touch black stuff was coming off from the shirt,0
2,"Cute. Its a print on stretchy material. The design isn't aligned properly on the material. I am 6'1"". The torso cut is NOT for us. I simply re-gifted it. Very unflattering. It's prettier on my computer screen. Hope this helps!",0
5,Love it,1
2,looked cheap and the fit wasn't like the model in the pic.,0
1,Shoes are already coming apart was purchased on the 9th of June and it is now 22.. 14 days!! Don't waste your money!!,0
2,"This cap looks OK, but a cold wind blows right thru it. Seems like wearing almost nothing at all. On your head, I mean.",0
1,This item arrived to my house smelling like a wet moldy basement. I was very strong and filled the whole room. Wondering where merchandise has been stored?,0
5,"The jacket is extremely light-weight and warm enough for the early winter. Like the water and wind resistance function, and true to size.",1
2,It shrunk after a couple of washes,0
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!! Silky texture, I‚Äôm a medium, will have to wear a tank under b cause it will show every jiggle lol (because of the material type ) sizing was also so perfect",1
5,"Fits perfect, one of my go to workout tops now.",1
1,Unfortunately on me it was a tent,0
1,Hate it. I want to return it. Really flimsy.,0
5,The jeans were true to size and fit perfectly,1
3,"Very cute, but WAY too large.",0
5,This band has been much more comfortable to wear on a regular basis than the one that came with the watch.,1
5,product was as described,1
3,"The top is nice, it's defenitally what I was expecting, and I dont have a big chest, so it covers everything comfortable. But the shorts are so big, they make my hips look huge and very unattractive. I'm 5'5 and 150Lbs. I bought the medium, and it isn't too tight. I maybe try buying a different style again, this time be sheIn",0
5,bought for my daughter and she loves it,1
2,The jacket was somewhat small and not as good a quality as I had hoped. The zipper is gold too and I had assumed from the photo it was silver.  I will return it as soon as I can figure out HOW- since there were no receipts or return info in the package,0
2,[[VIDEOID:d7ecd4d63db6fcdf3e01c21ba58793c6]] Beautiful mask great idea but after wearing 2-3times half the mask will glow.,0
5,"I'm an IT consultant and often on the road for work.  When I first started consulting, I would simply shove all my cords, chargers, adapters, chrome cast etc into my travel bag.  Several times I would forget items or even worse leave them in a hotel room because I couldn't quickly tell if I packed an item.  I tried several other organizers including several cases and had similar problems.  Grid-its are a great solution for the frequent traveler.  You can simply glance at them to make sure you have everything you need before you leave a location.  I use one grid-it for my most common travel items, chargers, cables etc and a second one when I visit a new client that includes adapters mouse etc.  I've not misplaced a single item since I started using them.<br /><br />Before purchasing this item, I read the negative reviews. The main complaint is items falling out in your bag.  Grid-its are not meant for one or two items.  You need to stuff them full, the more you add the tighter they grip.",1
3,Biggest problem was returning it when it didn‚Äôt fit perfectly. I was able to get a return address in Oregon instead of sending it back to China.,0
2,I thinked this is a rubber mask but this is a plastic mask which small babies plays with or which babies or childrens used in halloweens. I don't like this I want rupper mask or face mask I am not a child.,0
5,"These socks are great. My husband is hard to please, but he really likes these socks. Every time he puts one of these new pair on, he tells me how much he likes them. Says they fit so good, and feel better on his feet than his old brand.",1
5,Love this sweatshirt. Nice material. Arms are more like a 3/4 length.,1
3,The fabric faded quite a bit after first wash (in cold water). Still very cute shirt.,0
2,"I have always have good experience with Casio until now. If I had known about the light problem before, I wouldn't have made the purchase. I like to know what time it is in the dark, but this watch is a loser.",0
4,Love the dress itself. The fabric is nice and soft. Dress is just a little to big for me. Should have gotten a small.,1
5,"These T-shirts are great.  Good weight, wash well.  Quality is great for the price.  I will buy more for my daughter and probably myself as well.",1
5,My 5 year old son loves these jammies. Comfy and cool! Win-win for this Mama! :),1
1,My wife does not like walking in the sand so I got her a pair for our morning walks on vacation. After 2 and 1/2 weeks they have proved just what value they have for me. I stuffed paper towels in the sand sock/shoes so you can see the results. Bad is an understatement. should not be allowed to be sold.<br />John,0
3,Comfortable but they run a half size large. She normally wears a 9.5 but she could have benefited from a 9.,0
4,"It was not the colour i wanted but my cousin loves the colour she got, so i am happy about that.",1
5,Very nice!,1
2,"Wore this once and the fringe keeps falling out!!!!...Everywhere I go there is a trail.. :(<br />NOT HAPPY AT ALL.... The shape is a little odd to...the shoulders are wide..the neck is super large and the rest fits more like a regular med/lg...<br />Just weird.... My advice is ,,,, save your dime...",0
5,Very comfortable. Runs a little small.,1
3,Tighter than expected. It's going to sit in the closer until I lose a few pounds. Very pretty,0
1,K,0
2,"I'm 5'3, 165 lbs and these fit so weird. No room in the butt, so if you have a larger rear end, these are not for you. Also, tight on the thighs. The crotch is low making the entire fit awkward. Seems like these only fit tall slim woman.",0
5,Now I finally have a little black dress!,1
5,"Nice quality, super cute and snaps are easy to use",1
5,My husband bought some Timberland hiking boots before buying these and really likes this pair of boots. He likes that they're waterproof and comfy on his feet. I hope this helps someone thinking about buying these. I surely read a lot of reviews before purchasing. These are a great buy!!,1
3,"Ok for the price.  All pieces are holding up well except the wand.  Jewels were falling off the wand within a week. The gloves are a nice satin and better quality than I anticipated. You have to assemble the crown, and it didn't come with instructions, although it was pretty simple.",0
2,The robe itself was ok.  Soft and fits ok.  But the pink tie for the whole robe is NOT what you would expect from paying for a robe like that.  It's a craft ribbon!  Like you would use for a toddlers ponytail!  Not made of the same fabric that the robe is made from.  I gave it to my girls to play with because it was fraying on the ends and was disappointed to see that is what they put as the sash for the robe!  Was thinking of returning it but don't think I'll go through the hassle.,0
1,The colors look faded and the size was larger than expected.,0
5,Beautiful suit. Got lots of compliments.,1
3,"Good quality metal, but the diamond pieces fall out after a while. I received multiple of the same color, and some without diamonds. Still wear the ones with diamonds!",0
5,Great socks!  Perfect for Pilat's reformer classes.,1
1,"Product is not what is shown,very tiny thin chain.",0
5,Look great and don't hurt my head.,1
2,"I own a number of reproductive vintage dresses and although this dress looks like it could be, the fabric is lacking. I was disappointed as the print was so cute. I had to return. Like a number of previous reviewers stated, once wearing the dress, it fits okay here but it's too big there. And again, the fabric is no bueno.",0
4,Good,1
5,My granddaughter loves her new gymnastics leotards. Thank you,1
2,"These ""one size fits all"" masks really are just for small adults or children.  I am medium adult and they fit too tight.  Also, the material pills very fast compared to other brands I've used with the same material.  Not a bad value for the price but I will pick a different brand next time I re-order.",0
4,The perfect fit for small ears. It is a little larger than I thought and looks sturdy. Seems potentially itchy,1
1,It was very small and thin. I was more shrunk after I wash it.,0
2,these jeans are not created for curves. Feel like flattened my rear side and didn't fit as comfortably as I'd hoped.,0
2,Way to small,0
3,the sewing quality is not that great at the top.,0
3,"These run really small, be sure that you get a pair that are 2 SIZES larger than what you need.",0
4,My son loves it!,1
2,The way it was depicted in the picture was not what was actually. Item was much tighter and body hugging. I will keep and use under other items. Very sheer and not true to size. I am a medium/large.  I would have needed an xl for the fit portrayed in the picture.,0
5,Looks great! I love it!,1
1,Nothing special,0
1,Poor quality. The leg was broken after one month.,0
5,My 8 year old grand daughter highly approves!,1
3,"Inside is very roomy but the opening is not very handy.  You ll need to pull down both zipper to open it up wide enough to get your stuff, or use the side zipper.  It looks cute but the fabric is not as thick as I expected.",0
5,They are great mask,1
2,It was as though it was listed as a children‚Äôs skirt,0
5,Good fit,1
5,"Comfy, stretchy, super classy, very flattering to shorter-waisted people. Need a 2nd!",1
5,"Material is nice, this dress is really made and the material is nice quality, how light the fabric is. You don't worry about being hot with it in the summer and it is very cooling. The patterns is very beautiful, perfect for dressing up with heels or casual sandals. Great fit, so pretty and very comfortable. Highly recommended !",1
1,"After about 5 uses, this item no longer works.  It's essentially ""stripped.""  By that, I mean it slips when you try to crank it and no longer functions.  Purchase was a waste of money!",0
3,Nice but small.,0
1,Very tiny socks will not fit on adult feet. Cheap thin quality paid over S15.00 and received $4.00 credit for my return. Very unhappy...deserves a Zero.,0
3,"Pros:  Well made buckle with positive latch<br />  Customizable length<br />  Holds length adjustment without slipping<br />  Comfortable to wear - Web belt is semi-firm<br />Cons: Buckle will not pass thru the belt loops on most trousers<br />  Must remove half the buckle to put it on, then replace it after lacing it thru belt loops<br />  Webbing belt needs to be thicker and stiffer to be a true ""tactical"" belt<br />  Flexes too much to comfortably hold a firearm in a holster<br /><br />If you are buying this for a belt, you will probably be okay - except for the fact that you must remove the buckle to put it on.  If you want a ""tactical"" belt for wearing a holster, you should consider what firearm you will be carrying.  For lightweight firearms, up to smaller .380 calibers, you will probably be okay.  Full-size models will sag and droop on the thinner, wemi-flexible webbing.  Overall, the quality seems pretty good.  The buckle latch works well with a positive catch and release mechanism.",0
3,"I was so excited to get these shoes... since i have never ordered heels off of Amazon before, i read through a good amount of reviews on the fit of the shoe... everyone said they run tight and should get a half size bigger... i am normally a true 7. So i ordered at 7.5... got the shoes, tried them on and they are big. I will be using these shoes for mulitpul weddings and wedding events, at least i dont have to break them in! Always a positive.. anyway im too lazy to return them and get a different size.",0
1,The shirts have two large lines that go through them that make the shirt look like it does not fit or was tailored wrong.,0
5,The dress fits nicely even though I bought it a size smaller to lose weight into it. I used a shaper to help smooth it out. Got loads of compliments on the color and look of the dress. Can't wait to reach mo goal weight in it.,1
1,The chain fell apart before I managed to get it opened.  It looks and feels like trash.  Sorry I purchased it.,0
1,"We returned this item weeks ago at the UPS LOCATION IN HUMBLE, Tx. Almost immediately after it was received, the size was not right and I printed a return labe. Now Amazon says it did not receive it back ‚Ä¶.. what am I supposed to do?<br />Runs large.",0
1,The white stripes were made of vinyl. I figured I could have made it myself on a cricut machine so I sent it back.,0
1,"Size X-large is like size small, can barely get the shirt off and on.  The same identical brand and style I ordered previously fit fine in the X-Large, must be defective or miss-labeled",0
5,Worked as advertised. Looks great. Even the genius at the Apple Genius Bar complemented me on it. Couldn't take his eyes off it as we discussed my MacBook Pro. Wears very well.  I took mine to a jeweler and had the links adjusted to fit.  Love it.,1
5,I like it a lot,1
3,The cut of the dress looks very attractive in the picture. It looks very different in person.,0
5,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and the small was a little short on me. Just by about an inch or less. I love these sweats, though.",1
5,Excellent!,1
2,I am not impressed with these.  They are too tight and the fabric pulls so you see the white under the color,0
4,I like the shirt alot! I do suggest buying a little big because the fabric does not have a lot of stretch to it.,1
4,This one is very pretty. Although I used this one as a gift I think she likes it a lot.,1
4,"This is a very nice light weight sweater.  The size runs a little bit small, but I can still use it.  This sweater washes and dries well.",1
1,I am a 42 D and I thought if I got it bigger that the top would be bigger also. Boy was I wrong I was literally spilling out no matter how I positioned it.,0
5,Love it!,1
5,"Love this shirt, I have pretty much lived in it since I got it. I haven't put it in the drier, it fits perfect and I don't want it to shrink, so I hang it to dry. I am going to try to get one in blue too.",1
1,Also too small. Ordered largest size. Just didn't fit at all!!,0
5,Beautiful,1
2,"Two days of normal wear and the painted buckle is chipped and scratched.  I'm retired, not doing any hard lobar or anything just normal wear. Other than that I like the belt webbing and closure, just wish the buckle held up a little better.",0
1,I ordered 2Xl for my chest area only and couldn‚Äôt get the thing over my head !,0
1,I used the product for everyday wear and workout. After one use of soaking up with sweat the band did not go back to original size. Stretched out too far for a tight fit. In fact my watch was too loose to wear.,0
3,It was too small and short!!,0
1,"This swimsuit is awful. It's paper thin, the colors are not as rich as on screen and the bottom part is strangely huge. Do not buy.",0
1,"This is a strange material, exactly as described by a previous reviewer as being very similar to a ""dry fit"" t-shirt. Because of this and the light gray color, the outline of the pockets shows through. I can't imagine putting anything in the pockets because it will just look lumpy and weird. I'm 5'4"", 135, 34DD-28-36, and the medium fit as well as this dress possibly could. I returned it, but it was a refund that didn't have to be shipped back. I have no idea what I'm going to do with it. I might try to remove the pockets, but this dress is pretty hopeless.",0
5,Love these hate the pockets,1
1,Very odd fit...bunches up at the chest area...very unflattering!! Complete waste of money!,0
1,The slippers literally cut through the top layer of my skin. First time wearing them. Walked a bit more than half a mile. Felt the chafing within a few steps but couldn't turn back.<br /><br />Threw them out soon as I got home. Total waste of money. DO NOT BUY.,0
3,"Didnt like the fit and finish of these. Didnt conform to my foot well, and it looked like the straps would break from the sole relatively easily. Returned",0
3,Like all the credit card holders.,0
2,No support. I bought this thinking there would be something to hold the girls up but there wasn't.,0
5,"Very cute, as expected.",1
5,"This wallet is great!  It is made with high-quality materials and it can hold a lot of cash, coins, and cards.  If you need a wallet and like a sleek, yet simple design, then this wallet is for you!",1
3,Cheap made broke on me,0
2,Definatly not a real soft material,0
5,This was everything I wanted. It is a little short in the sleeves though,1
1,It didn‚Äôt fit. Beautiful dress but 3 size to small<br /><br />Would love to get one that fits me,0
5,"Best liner gloves, very warm and feels very durable. Seems great quality!!",1
1,Not worn ones and broke by trying to put the pendant on. Would not buy it again.,0
5,I bought these to match a pearl necklace.  They were exactly as described and just what I wanted.,1
3,The reason I paid more for this is because it had the plastic block that would prevent the teeth no to dig into the fabric. It only came with one plastic block.,0
1,for me this was an epic fail,0
5,"This bag looks good, is sturdy, and versatile.  Easy accommodates my laptop, and tablet, with space for books, writing material, and accessories for my computers, it is easy to carry as a briefcase or messenger bag.",1
1,"I need to return this items , it wasn't real coach my foot are painful",0
4,"Love this cup! I work 10 hour days and an hour each way. A nice size that fits in my lunch box, and keeps it hot/warm most of the day, which I'm happy with. After all, I don't want to burn my mouth on it and want it to cool some. I use it for broth so I don't refill it at all once I leave home. 9 hours later and still warm enough to finish. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because some of the paint came off trying to scrub off the sticky from the sticker. But that doesn't affect the  cup from keeping my broth warm lol. Definitely worth the price in my opinion",1
4,Really nice but completely not true on sizes,1
3,Washed one time and shrunk.  Ok to wear but not the fit and finish I expected.  Too Short now.,0
5,Still looks good,1
2,"After the first wash, the front pocket started coming apart. NO BUENO!",0
1,Too tight material does not stretch itchy because the sequence I‚Äôm giving it away,0
5,Gave it as a gift to my Grandaughter.,1
5,"LOVE this blouse. It's so comfortable. Soft, and looks just like the picture.",1
3,I like the material for under a dress but they run really small.  I usually wear a 6 or 8 pants and the medium was more of a child size medium.,0
5,"This dress is BEAUTIFUL. Buy, buy, buy.",1
5,Beautiful,1
2,I ordered burgundy and received a wine red am very disappointed.,0
1,"The material is so bad. The bottom was all loose up. It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt finish sewing and shipped it. Don‚Äôt buy, it‚Äôs a waste of money. You will regret like how I‚Äôve regretted",0
2,This isn‚Äôt all cotton. Must have some sort of polyester in it. It‚Äôs too hot and itchy. Cute style for summer for a short walk from the beach parking lot to the sand. That‚Äôs about it.,0
2,"Was very excited to wear this dress to work shortly after I received it in the mail. It fits according to size (I'm a size 4/6 and ordered a small), but the zipper broke on the first zip! I love the style and the way it fits, so I may try adding a new zipper.",0
1,"I consider these socks to be more expensive than what I usually pay for socks. I wore them once, washed them and they have already begun having holes in them. My feet are an average size 8 and i didnt do anything abnormal in wearing them. This is very disappointing",0
4,"Love these. very comfy, a bit larger than comparable products of same size.",1
2,"Like all soundtracks if you heard the tune at all during an episode you probably just heard 30 seconds or so of it, (some tunes were over 10 minutes in length‚Ä¶the entire scene wasn't that long). I listened to the whole thing and may not ever do that again.<br />I thought the sound quality was poor, most of the selections didn't amount to much. I like a tune that makes me think ""I wish I had some video to use that in""‚Ä¶not this one. I think that of the three Supergirl soundtrack CD's this one is the worst. I don't see a fourth listed, maybe they haven't been selling well enough to justify  making more.",0
5,Good look and feel.,1
5,Love it!,1
4,This are really cook sunglasses and at a very good price! I am very happy with my new glasses. Good purchase. I recommend,1
5,Love this mask! Durable and my baby wasn‚Äôt scared when I had it on which is a plus! :),1
2,"The ring itself is cute and not long which is exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs also great for sensitive skin, not bothersome at all there. Unfortunately after wearing it for a week, the top ball has come off by itself and gotten lost. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. If the company is willing to replace the ring, I will update my review.",0
4,"Very comfortable, easy to stay on. And yes they are a little large. I'm thinking they might shrink a little when they are washed.",1
3,"I like them, but tad inexpensive, so quality is just ok.  They don't always stay up either, but they are cute!",0
3,The fit was a little snug through the hips.  The color is beautiful.,0
5,"Excellent mask. Perfect fit and very soft. And most importantly.., these aren‚Äôt violins, these are guitars! üé∏üòÅ",1
5,Beautiful and just as described,1
4,The tail part was cute. Although as an XL(usa) woman it was hard getting into it. The waist band was very tight.,1
3,"I got the watch and immediately put it on and loved how it fit on my wrist and the way it looked.  Everything worked great for 2 days when on the third day I look down and the second hand is spinning whenever I move my hand.  Its like it has come off the center cap.  While I don't really care that the second hand doesn't work as it is a digital/analog watch, it just doesn't look as cool and I wont be bragging about my watch to anyone.",0
5,These are beautiful tiny mask that I used for decor. I felt they looks smaller than in the picture. But it was for decor so it worked fine.,1
2,"The design and appearance is really nice. It is comfortable, and easy to get on and off. It fits my Apple Watch well. However, after wearing it for about a month, the finish on the underside is starting to wear off.  Disappointing.",0
1,Website indicates 100% organic cotton.  Label is in Chinese and does not indicate 100% organic.,0
3,Don't waste your money. I bought a 2 x and a 3x.  The 2x was larger than the 3x.  Very very sad quality of the fabrics. The stitching was raveling after the first delicate wash.  Forget about these.,0
1,What a rip off and not only the price and no pockets on the pj's and the material suck eggs and from India and very rude too and the top is a large and that is to small and I am small myself :( Bummed and not buying anything ever from you :(,0
1,"Upside, they didn't leak. I have different Aegend goggles that are good, but have a light tint.  Wanting more tint I tried these.  Above water they are fine, but below water, horrible.  I had terrible distortion that created a v-shaped double vision that made it hard to swim as well as making me a bit queasy.  Also it made my depth-of-field off.  Perhaps it is the mirror finish that did this, as my other Aegend goggles are very similar except have only the light tint.  They also fogged badly.  Couldn't do a lap without fog.  I am returning this item and writing my first review.",0
2,Very pretty but the stone wasn‚Äôt glued in when it arrived,0
1,"I received this item damage. The see thru case of the timer was cracked.  My packaging wasn‚Äôt damage, so I wonder how this could have happened.  I wanted to keep it, but with it being cracked, I returned it.  My hopes of wearing this cute watch was cracked.",0
2,"Wow. The reviews about this being incredibly small are absolutely correct. I usually wear a L, ordered an XXL and couldn't even get this on. Body is a cotton-like knit and the arms are a thin nylon-type, with almost zero stretch. Good bless Amazon and their easy returns!",0
4,Kinda on the small end of small. Clingy will show curves,1
5,Love them,1
5,Excellent quality! Very comfortable!,1
4,el cubrimiento de las cremalleras y la calidad de las mismas deficiente.,1
1,Cheap fabric. Size is also completely off‚Ä¶ I got one for my 8 year old daughter that turned out to be almost my size (L adult)!!!,0
3,"Product works, but the ring that is turned by the crank handle tends to break easily after sun exposure and should be made of metal, not plastic.",0
5,Exactly as described. Fit great. Comfortable.,1
4,Very comfortable and I would definitely buy it again!!,1
4,Pretty print and lots of flowing skirt fabric.  Don't care for the button/loop closing all the way down the front.,1
1,The band design disintegrated in just a few weeks. Poor quality.,0
5,Good quality and exactly what I was looking for.,1
1,"The sweater they sent me had one tie at the side it‚Äôs supposed to tie on that was like only 4 or 5 inches long,<br />And the tie on the other side was crazy long so the only way to tie the sweater was to wrap the one tie all the way around your waist like a belt and then tie it to the little tie on the side which is not long enough to make a bow with. So then it‚Äôs this baggy loose sweater with a waist tie belt that I couldn‚Äôt make a bow with, it looked awful and not the drooping loose side tie sweater as shown in the picture.",0
1,Clasp does not work,0
1,"Maybe when she wears a size 8'thesenwl got her. But at as size 5, no way!",0
4,"These arrived really quickly, and I'm very happy with the quality! Some fit a little more loosely than others, but they all fit on at least on finger on my hands.",1
2,Too small and different from what I saw online,0
4,it is indeed larger than what you normally get from a department store. My head is a little wide than usual so it was hard for me to just get a cap I need.The only thing is that I hope it is shorter from front to end so it fits tighter when I am in headwind.,1
1,"I just got this dress today, and it was waaaaaay to small. Who's idea of a XXL is this. The arms are cut for a large and the chest measurements are laughable.  The actual size of the XXL is a M/L fit and the chest cant be any larger than a 38 or 40 B. The thinness of the material is really the only acurate thing about this dress when it comes to a discription. If you as a company cant accurately cut for a size larger than an american M/L, please stop selling this merchandise like you can.",0
1,Dingy and looks used. Not pleased at all.,0
5,Love It....Brought this as a maternity wear during my pregnancy. They are super comfy & very elegant.,1
1,I am a size 8 so ordered the L to be safe.  It was the length of a tunic with arms as wide as a child's medium.  If you are an adult do not expect to fit unless you order 3-4 sizes larger.  What a waste,0
5,Great shirt.,1
3,"I normally wear a 6.5 boots, but this is a little tight and narrow.",0
4,Great,1
5,"My 84 year young mother was needing some new house shoes. She said she wished they still made the ones like I used to give her every Christmas when I was a child. I said Moon Boots? She didn't remember the name, but I told her that they came out around 1970, and I thought they got their name from the Apollo moon landings. I'm probably wrong, that was many brain cells ago, but that's how I remember it! I Googled Moon Boots and lo and behold, there they were just as I remembered them. She still wasn't sure, so I ordered them just as I had purchased them for so many years at K Mart. They arrived 2 days later and when I opened the package for her she got so excited saying that's exactly what she has been looking for but she had decided they didn't make them anymore because she couldn't find them in any local stores. Ahh, the power of the internet and Amazon.com. Bringing back memories of a time long ago and making Mom happy, at least for a little while. And reminding her why I am still her Number 1 son. (ok, I'm her only son, but that's beside the point!) Oh, the quality and workmanship were just as good or better than what she now remembers me buying for her in a much happier time in our lives. Priceless!",1
4,"Ok I got this for my boyfriend and myself and I have to say I love it, but after a while of regular wear they start to get scuffed up. Don't get me wrong I love it and so does he but I wish the plating would stay better",1
4,Un poco estrecha al frente.,1
5,"I normally wear size L, and this pajamas is just fit as expected. This pajamas is very soft and comfortable, and i often wear it to sleep.",1
1,"Cheap garbage!, turns your neck green!!!",0
1,These tanks run way too large. I‚Äôm a 36DD and these tanks swallowed me.,0
1,NOT true to color.,0
5,Perfect for the price,1
3,"These run small.  A girl in the thinner side would be fine (but they would be on the shorter side). Unfortunately my daughter removed tags so I can‚Äôt return, but heed the warning.",0
2,Sole was ok but the top fabric was to stretchy.  Slipper wasn't very comfortable.,0
2,"This item looked cute in the package. But once I put it on my dog for a Halloween party, feathers everywhere. I can‚Äôt return this because I used it, but I would not recommend this item.",0
5,This is a very nice sweater.,1
3,"It is see through. Not what I was expecting when I ordered it, the fabric is thin.",0
1,I received an item that did not say Birthday Girl. It also was not as nice as I expected. Would have been okay if it said what it was supposed to say but I received a completely different item. The bag was mislabeled so I assume that's what happened.,0
1,Nice color but too small for wide calf,0
1,The inside of the belt broke,0
3,"It is a really nice key ring, but is much smaller than i anticipated.",0
3,Haven't worn the dress.  I think I need to get a bigger size or lose the weight.  feels and looks fine.  will not return it.,0
1,Vino roto,0
1,Really cheap frames. Lots of blemishes right out of the box and the plastics that goes behind your ears slide right off.,0
2,This dress is so big on the top and is not flattering at all. It‚Äôs also completely hard to put on by yourself you have to have somebody helping you.,0
3,Neck and pendant don‚Äôt have the same color and the claps on the necklace came faded and it‚Äôs suppose to be stainless steel. It doesn‚Äôt look that nice the necklace looks super cheap but the pendant looks okay and shiny.,0
3,"Its a little big and not the highest quality. However, for this price, totally worth it. You wear it for what it says not how it fits anyway. Good for the price.",0
5,"Love these booties , both me and my daughter bought them , but they do run very small . I bought half size bigger , and my daughter one whole size bigger",1
3,"I bought 3 sets of thermals for different people in my family. This is the only plus size one I purchased. In comparison this set was shockingly thin, and by far the most expensive set I purchased. Can we please stop shortchanging plus sized people with clothing? I'm just trying to keep my family warm.",0
1,The largest size available (4XL) is equivalent to a XL. Do not buy anything from this company if you value your time and money.,0
3,I ordered brown and received white in a different size.  Fit my sister.  Very narrow sandal.,0
1,Does not look as nice as the picture probably won‚Äôt order a dress from here again. Tried to get it for a homecoming dress and didn‚Äôt fit at all. It sucked to have to hurry and find another dress,0
4,I really liked this shirt but it was a little tight in the sleeves. I returned Because it was a little too uncomfortable for me. Overall a very cute shirt though!,1
5,"I love this watch! It's extremely accurate and the second hand and minute hand are dead on with the markers. The crystal is very durable and antireflective coating works really well. I can be in direct sunlight and be able to read the dial with no reflection. It's got a 24 hour dial at the 12 o'clock position showing morning or night. At the 3 o'clock position is the iconic  MT-G symbol. At the 6 o'clock position the dial shows the time and the alarm time. At the 9 o'clock position it shows the day of the week, the mode and the battery level meter. At the 4:30 position it shows the date. Also just above the date, there's a tiny dial that shows AM or PM for the time. Between the 7 & 8 o'clock position it has an ultra bright LED light that lights up the entire face. It has 2 ways of syncing up the time, one is by the radio receiver that connects with the atomic clock at Fort Collins, Co. And the 2nd way is by Bluetooth connecting to your phone thereby connecting with world time servers. This is the highest quality watch I own. It was a fair price at $900.  Highly recommended!!",1
5,"My wife purchased this, she said she bought a large but should have went with a medium.  The colors are not what are shown in the picture but she does get a lot of compliments on it. Plus, she loves it.",1
5,Feels okay but might conduct static due to the fabric. Its not too thick but also not too thin? it's a weird fabric but it feels comfortable. I wouldn't say lightweight but it's not heavy. Might get hot during the summer or when working out.,1
5,Fits great good stretch,1
1,Disgusting. I though as a society we were growing out of this crap.,0
5,I was looking for an inexpensive digital watch. This is exactly what I wanted. No complaints.,1
4,"I had been looking for a ring with dragon influenced art for awhile. I'm hard on my hands and have broken several rings with stones in the past. As a result, I need a band that sits flush and can withstand daily use and abuse. This ring is a great compromise. It has a beautiful design and the blue color is truly gorgeous. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear. I usually wear a size 6 1/2, but ordered a size 7. I'd rather a ring be a little bigger than smaller. It fits me perfect, sobi would say perhaps the bring runs a tad on the smaller side. The only complaint I do have is the design inlay on my bring isn't centered. It sits right at the top,which leaves a disproportionate amount of blue showing at the bottom. As a result, the design at the top is muddled and hard to make out in some areas.",1
5,It's really cute But I got too big of booty so needs to be longer,1
5,Love this dress everything I wanted. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and it goes past the floor on me so it is really long but I love it anyway,1
5,"This is a nice ring,good detail,no sharp edges. Solid piece of jewelry.",1
5,Box: Awesome. Packaging: Awesome. Socks: Awesome.,1
5,"I bought this for a cruise because I wanted some sparkly! I read all the fit guidelines and ordered accordingly so it fit well.  The length was perfect for me, as was the neckline and the shoulder coverage.  I accessorized with a rose gold necklace and earrings and was out the door to dinner!  The best part was how many looks and compliments I received wearing such an 'easy' dress!  I felt fab!  For the price, I am impressed and really happily surprised with this dress.",1
1,Broke after the first wear.,0
4,I would recommend ordering a size or 2 smaller.,1
5,"Works as expected, no complaints on being used as a temporary kilt extender",1
4,"This wrist band was purchased as a replacement for the wrist band on the Casio AE-1300WH watch.  The band fit perfectly in the 18mm opening, but the material of band was a bit stiff.  The cost of this band makes it a great alternative to the Casio brand wrist band.",1
5,"I am 5 ft 2 and they fit perfect.  they are really comfortable, I could see me wearing them for more then just exercise.",1
4,I love it! Cheap material,1
5,Great for summer wear and longing at home,1
1,"Poorly designed and cheap, would not recommend",0
5,Very cute dress. Bought it for our preteen daughter.,1
3,The metal is made of cheap material,0
2,"Biggest dislike was the polka dots. I really liked them on the model, but when I actually got the dress the polka dots were much bigger than expected and nothing like the cute little dots on the pictured model. Also was not expecting the dress to be a high-low. Again it was different than the actual picture.",0
1,It came apart on the 2nd day.,0
1,"Very cheap quality. Only two pairs were packaged nicely and the rest in small bags. Arrived broken, the flower one was missing a gem, and the heart ones had come with the charm broken off. Returned them.",0
5,I like it but I have yet to wear it,1
5,Like,1
5,I love it. It came before it was due. I love the price of this product. It looks just what I thought it would be. Will recommend this product to everyone who ask me about this bracelet.,1
5,"This dress, it's too beautiful to just call a dress, but it's everything. The material was nice, the beading excellent and shipping fast. When I opened the package I knew it was perfect for hosting my company's event. Definitely buy this!",1
3,didn't look as good as picture,0
5,I love it so much it goes with my braclet.,1
3,looks good but didn't fit so i returned it.,0
3,"Short, wide and somewhat see through.",0
1,Weird shine to the material as well as weird smell. Elastic on the waste band hurts after a little wear. Not true to size. One zipped pocket one normal pocket looks bizarre on the body.,0
3,"I ordered two different colors in the same size (medium) and this frost grey color came 1 1/2 inches bigger than the other chrome medium!<br />Also, the chrome color is much more purple in person. The pants are comfy but good luck finding the right color and size! Way too much effort in my opinion.",0
1,"The strap I received was not a single piece of genuine leather as depicted.  It has a cheap glued backing on the inner wrist that is uncomfortable and was already starting to separate from the top layer of the strap right out of the box.  I returned it and ordered a Benchmark Basics horween leather strap instead that is an absolute work of art by comparison - single piece, soft, supple, perfectly dyed and only slightly more expensive.  Hard pass on this product.",0
5,Love them,1
5,I love this dress! It's so flowy and the fabric is super soft! My bridesmaids wore these dresses for my wedding and I had to buy one for myself too! It was great for me to wear to school when I was student teaching and pregnant. The dress grew with my body and fit nicely. I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!,1
2,Cheap all the way around. And the chain is a weird length it either needs to be longer or shorter,0
5,The people I bought these for love them,1
5,"for the price, this size is excellent for my needs. It's strong and even though it is just a simple white bag, it's still a great bag that will allow your products to peak through. Strong and sturdy. Great Value. Several sizes available.",1
3,"A tad smaller around the chest than what you'd think, I thought it would fit since it is a stretchy material, but it looks very odd on larger chests; if you have a larger chest I wouldn't suggest this product, but otherwise super cute, and good material. A little short, but that's not much of a problem, not a bad buy!",0
1,This dress was pretty when it arrived although a bit larger than I had hoped. I wore it once and the seams in the dress just disintegrated one by one over the course of the evening leaving gaping holes that had to be camouflaged with a jacket.,0
5,"I know this is very beautiful,I love it.",1
1,Didn‚Äôt fit,0
4,these glasses are cute. I like the fit. I don't like the little bar at the bridge of the nose. Its not a big deal. I do like them.,1
1,"The second I put this thing on, I started thinking like a fat, stupid, orange buffoon. No thanks.",0
5,The color was a little different than what the picture looked like but still a nice blouse,1
1,I am a 36DDD and a size Med was too loose. The thin elastic at the top is too thin and weak and I felt like the dress would slide down. The rouched top also look akward.  eturned.,0
1,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 245lbs, curvy!  I ordered the 3X figuring it would be extras long so I could wear heels. It was NOT! Not only was it too short the look it gives on the picture as if it tappers in at the bottom, NOT‚Ä¶ It flairs out. That shape of the dress is NOT there! The material wasn‚Äôt bad at all. Although the color wasn‚Äôt bad it is not the color in the picture, the lighter part is much lighter and the dark part is not as dark as the picture! I was so disappointed I literally had to measured this dress! It was 2-4 inches shorter than the chart said it would be. I ordered it big and it was still too small. NOT TRUE TO SIZE, COLORS OFF AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE!!",0
3,"The shoe is cute and seems sturdy.  However, the shoe came without an insole.  This was a disappointment but not so serious as we purchased a size that was too big for her.  We returned the shoe and ordered a size down.  The new size that came in had an insole but our little girl did not like walking in these (which is surprising because she was totally fine with the momobaby mustache shoe).  We returned it.",0
1,"I‚Äôve owned this product for two days. Received 1/20/17 and did not take out of package until 1/22/17 when I placed it on my watch and wore it around the house just to see if I would keep it because even though it‚Äôs leather, it‚Äôs a suede like leather which, as I found, picks EVERYTHING up. Not to mention, the band isn‚Äôt white as stated when I purchased it. The picture didn‚Äôt look white but I thought this could have been due to lighting‚Ä¶ no it‚Äôs actually a beige/nude color which is nice, though not what I expected and not what I had intended to order. If it were pebbled leather, I probably would have kept it.",0
2,It‚Äôs a tight fit on the size and the pocket already ripped on one side  from just putting hands in,0
5,Little hard  but cute,1
1,"The shirt and print is nice. I had to give it one star, because the word ‚Äúwritten‚Äù is spelled wrong.",0
4,"I like the turtleneck, but I thought it would be thicker.",1
2,These mala beads were made loosely and fell apart after a couple of days. Please make them tighter.,0
5,Absolutely LOVED this head piece. It worked so well with the 40's themed ball I attended!!,1
3,Looks like Night gown üòÇüò¨üò¥,0
5,Thr gloves are very sleek-looking. Great quality. I highly recommend this set of gloves.,1
2,"Lots of fire! But the plastic  backs, are so cheap.",0
5,just as described,1
2,But the skulls are too over sized for the subtle look I was going for and it feels sort of cheap.,0
5,Great for going on walks when the weather is chilly. Stays put nicely. Very soft and stretchy.,1
4,On time delivery and good material.,1
3,Fits small and does not sit well in the shoulders.,0
1,"Only received 1, not 4 pairs, for $20.  Returned them.  Thin quality too.",0
5,"My mom needed a new pair of shades for the bright summer sun. This was a nice, stylish, inexpensive pair of sunglasses that looks like it will last throughout the summer at least. May not be top quality but they definitely do the job by protecting your eyes from the bright sun.",1
5,Worked great to wear my magic band 2 on my Apple Watch band! I loved not having to wear two bands and it felt very secure.,1
5,Loved it looks just like what‚Äôs pictured.,1
1,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this item. In a few days it tarnished. The chain was of very poor quality,0
2,"Gloves are at the best rated for 40 degrees, after 30 minutes at 32-34 working outside I had very cold hands<br /><br />Made to look good and warm,, deceitfully so!  ok for cool weather only",0
1,I was very disappointed. It appeared larger,0
1,terrible product.  They are blurry and not clear to read through at all,0
3,It would be cute but it is super tiny and short,0
4,Great Casual dress. Please purchase an appropriate size as if its too small the pattern will stretch and look distressed. The dress came in a very timely manner and was just as the picture and description described. Great dress for a night clubbing out with the girls,1
2,the beads are not stuck and they keep falling off.,0
5,These socks are awesome. Great set for a super affordable price.,1
3,Quality good but the hole  Is so large that  it stays turned upside down on the chain. Would not reorder.,0
2,hard to tell time with it you have to go where there is some light and tilt it around to see the time,0
1,To big and the material is cheap!,0
1,"Dress is beautiful, came to us used, stained and dirty.",0
5,Good for price great on job sits,1
1,"The front image is crooked! And it took forever to get here, so I don‚Äôt have time to exchange before I give this as a gift for Christmas!",0
1,"[[VIDEOID:7b57ad1a100663d6928a2c4aa3316cea]] looks nothing  like the photo the photo shows a black tee that look like its been bleach tie-dyed  its nothing like that looks to be a print in the material and its not like a regular tee , it‚Äôs faded  the tee looks more gray then black. very unhappy  i was really looking forward to getting this  to wear to halloween party and now not sure if i want to send it back or what because not sure if i get another one in time . very unhappy with tee",0
1,Glasses left the side of my heads green.  Do not buy these. Worst purchase I have made.  Do not buy these,0
1,"Says it was a match for my opener but didn‚Äôt work, so I returned it",0
4,"So hands down these are the most comfy ""yoga"" pants ever. But they are certainly not made for any type of exercise. Nothing can breathe ""down there"" so you get very sweaty... and it soaks into your pants. I tried riding a bike in these bad boys and had a huge butt sweat print on my pants. Perfect for lounging around the house and being comfy but don't confuse these for being yoga pants or any kind of exercise pants.",1
2,Rather flimsy!,0
1,This umbrella is beautiful but it's much bigger and bulkier thank I expected. It's not easy to carry around with it and the wrist handle isn't comfortable.,0
3,"I love the fabric. The bill on the cap is much larger than I expected, maybe it would  be better for a man.  I didn't return it because of the fabric and I wear it sometimes",0
1,I bought this as a replacement for my significant other who had the exact pendant. He wore it for over a year and a half without taking it off and it still looked great the day the chain broke while he was working and it was lost. So I looked this one up which was slightly cheaper and bought it. It arrived and looked fine at first but within a week in tarnished and won‚Äôt clean with toothpaste or sterling cleaner. It‚Äôs apparently low quality silver. It does have the 925 stamp but it doesn‚Äôt perform like sterling silver should. I‚Äôd buy one be from a different seller.,0
5,Perfect Fit and very a very sporty look.  I'm a happy customer!,1
1,Not impressed. The ‚Äúleather‚Äù cracked as soon as I went to put it on. The print is now cracked.,0
4,Great soft and comfortable jacket,1
5,"Hynes Eagle Crocodile Pattern Tote Bag is an expensive looking hand bag. As a man, all the female friends and relatives like it a lot. They want one, Xmas time, they all say.",1
2,sleeves were too long but bust size was too small,0
1,No give no stretch fabric is itchy and irritating not comfortable at all,0
4,"Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  It is obvious that it is not &#34;real&#34; because of the rhinestones but, for what it is and the price, I love this bracelet.  I will enjoy wearing it any time of the year.  It is a timeless, classic look. Highly recommend.",1
5,They are adorable! My girls can dance and twirl in them comfortably. They appear to be made well although I'm sure the skirt would tear sooner if they used them to play in rather than just for dance class.,1
5,"quality excellent, fits secure for colder weather, price was right. Happy purchaser.",1
5,Fit well and comfortable love them,1
5,They fit great on my 3 year old. She really likes them to bad they don't make them for her mouth when she wears them she's always yelling when she has them on. Which is to be expected,1
5,I love the way they feels/fit.,1
5,Pleasantly surprised. I am an 8 and bought an 8 and it fits perfectly. good quality. Will be looking to purchase more from this designer.,1
5,I thounght it would be thick. I love ot,1
2,"Oh no! What happened to this hat? It is not supposed to flop like this way yet it does. I cannot wear it outside in public both for safety reasons and it doesn‚Äôt look cool. I can‚Äôt see anything without tilting my head all the way back or holding the flopping hat with both my hands and so it looks, well like the picture. I tried leaving it alone for 2 days to see if that made a difference but it didn‚Äôt. Sorry, I wouldn't recommend it.",0
5,"Adorable , It helped me with my decision on getting pierced or not . I did!",1
2,"The fabric is not as advertised, very poor quality and uncomfortable. Smells absolutely horrible (you should wash it first anyways, but still makes you wonder how sanitary it is). Even image is poor and fuzzy (my phone camera did a good job at trying to clarify the image, but just look at the clarity difference between the mask and the counter its on. Would be worth $5 maybe, definitely not $16. As a seamstress, I can see where the fabric isn't going to last long. Not a terrible product, but just isn't worth the price for what you get.",0
3,Loved this cute little outfit!! But the pants were too long :(,0
1,Literally broke apart on the day of arrival.,0
5,Great addition to wardrobe.  Have not been disappointed with anything from Next Level.  Looks and Fits like much more expensive Ts,1
2,Broke in less than a month :(,0
1,It looks like a piece of cut material ver minimal stitching and shaping. It looks better in the photo versus what I received.,0
5,"Looks just like the picture, and it fits very well. I am very satisfied with it",1
4,Really nice wristband.,1
5,Kids are loving these over having to put a mask on. Plan on ordering more.,1
5,Super comfortable and soft!,1
5,A gift for Christmas,1
4,This was a good fit and made well,1
3,My daughter is tall and thin so the sleeves are a bit short and the body is wide but the lengthen is ok. It's very pretty though.,0
1,"Based on the chart I should be a small, size 2, the hips built in didn‚Äôt even touch me and awkwardly long (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô). Hoped this would be better!-(",0
5,The underwear is very comfortable and soft.,1
5,"Very cute lightweight material great for a tropical summer vacation. Arrived on time.  I am 5'1, 34 DD and 130lb.  With that being said, the front is on the verge of being too short so if you're looking for modesty this may not be your best option unless you get a red slip.",1
2,Daughter loved it....till it broke.  Not made of the best quality material.  was nice looking though.,0
3,Liked the glasses but didn‚Äôt last a month until lens where coming off,0
1,Broke in two weeks and I had it protected in my pocket.,0
1,The band I received didn't match the picture.  I gave it away.,0
3,Not really happy,0
1,My son wore them twice and the inside of the shoe started breaking apart. There‚Äôs a blue foam in the inside under the inner sole that just started breaking apart. Seems like they are good for just one trip,0
5,Looks just like my Marine issue rank pins!,1
3,It‚Äôs just ok,0
1,"In less than 3 months of light use, the plastic arm broke away from the eyepiece. They haven‚Äôt been dropped, twisted, etc. Even Wally World‚Äôs $10 glasses don‚Äôt do this badly.",0
1,Was super darker than the picture ...i wanted a lighter jean so i ordered the plain classic because it looks light on the picture smh,0
3,Very pretty but on the heavy side. I would only wear for short periods of time such as an evening event simply due to the weight,0
5,bien,1
1,"My other nightgown has been great so I ordered the floral pattern. It faded immediately after washing, it is scratching it in the material is heavy, not soft at all. I am checking to see if I can send it back otherwise I will be throwing it away.",0
5,Good quality and perfect size for travelling daily use.,1
3,"Based on the reviews I bought a large since I am a bit busty, and have a little belly.  It was too big!  It was also heavier than I expected.  It might be better for the midwest or areas when you would wear a jacket, as I can't imagine dealing with the Arizona sun in that heavy dress.It was very pretty though.  I am still a little sad it didn't work out!",0
2,The part of the sleeve around the bicep is too small and doesn't have much stretch,0
3,"I ordered these in two colors. They arrived quickly. The clarity on the tortoise pair, was somewhat distorted in the non-bifocal area, and one side of the black pair twisted when putting them on and taking them off.",0
5,Working well so far. I usually get a breakout from metal bands.,1
4,"Everything was great and the dress is nice, only issue I have is its to short on me I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it barley covers my butt. Other than that I would of rated it a 5 star",1
5,"Love the color. Love the material, it looks very expensive. It is supportive but not very much, I think it all depends on the size of the chest, it support my chest enough. Really comfy, I wear 34B and got the size 6 for a reference. The pads inside are not removable, great for light workout.",1
3,Waaaaaay small....fit my daughter who is a size 6,0
1,Had I known this was made in China I wouldn't have ordered them. Amazon needs to disclose the country of origin on all of their products!!,0
2,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but I couldn‚Äôt get these on. I have a 28‚Äù waist and 41‚Äù hips, and I first tried the S-M based on others‚Äô reviews. Nope, couldn‚Äôt get them up. I ordered a L-XL, and still couldn‚Äôt get them up all the way past my hips. I wear an 8-10 or M in most things, so I was surprised I couldn‚Äôt wear these. L-XL is supposed to fit up to size 24, but I don‚Äôt see how since they didn‚Äôt even fit me at size 10. I liked the material and they were soft, so it‚Äôs too bad.",0
5,"Great compression socks! I work at an office that treats Varicose Veins and I was very impressed with the strength and durability of the product, I tried a similar cheaper product and threw them away after one use. I ended up purchasing 4 pairs of these and look forward to purchasing more.",1
1,"Got it and two weeks later it had stoped working, sent it back and never got a refund.",0
5,The mask fits perfect. Beautiful colors,1
4,"Overall, I like this set.  The colors look more vibrant in person.  The top fits me well, but the bottoms are bigger than I expected.  They legs seem to be cut larger than they appear online.  I was hoping for a more tapered leg and these are pretty wide all the way down.  Not as flattering as I had hoped, but they are comfortable.",1
2,The idea of this mask was good but it did NOT work for me. It fogs up quickly. It is impossible to breathe in these. I felt like I was trapped in a plastic bag. I do not recommend this product.,0
1,The photo makes these earrings look much bigger than they are.. They are very small. The size was given in centimeters and I wished I had taken it seriously.,0
5,"Case was 8 dollars, i really needed somethinf to protect my oakley glasses. I have 2 pairs of gas cans, a pair of wisker xl, and hollbrook. This case checked all my boxes. Its sturdy and stiff, it will withstand everything short of you stepping on it. Zipper effectively kept out blowinf sand at the beach.<br /><br />  There are three ways to attach this case, all work well! If the plastic carabiner breaks, at this price you can just buy a metal one to replace it.<br />  My only recommendation is nyou should keep your glasses in a soft microfiber baggie. Helps with rattle!",1
5,Was tired of getting other med id bracelets updated and cut off for mri. This one is rubber and easy to set up.,1
1,"style was is great, hence the purchase, but holy moly is it uncomfortable on your nose. NO support there and leaves very visible (and painful) indents on the nose. You can feel the poor quality. I wish these were comfortable bc they're so cute! But absolutely not.",0
5,I am small to medium and it fit just right. Navy is almost black. I am adding a belt and will wear it to a wedding.,1
4,I got them for my 7 year old nephew. He loves them.,1
2,Shoes have an appearance of being cheaply made.  I would not purchase them again.,0
5,"Very comfortable, well made, highly recommended",1
5,Love these. I will order more. Very nice for gifts.,1
5,They go with everything. I use these for style.,1
4,The gloves overall are good. They run a bit small so I would go up a size. The touchscreen feature doesn‚Äôt work that well. I bought these for a trip to a cabin in December so they work for what I want them.,1
5,"Perfect fit, came in time for Christmas party. I enjoy a little plaid this season.",1
3,My wife loved the color and design of the coat but it was almost impossible to zip up. Unfortunately we returned the coat.,0
1,The product arrived damaged.,0
5,Works good I stand on a ladder almost all day. Helps with my planter fasciitis,1
5,"My 9 year old was very happy with the costume, the top and skirt were a perfect fit.",1
4,"Very pretty. But, very sheer. Definitely need to wear a tank under it.",1
5,"The necklace is beautiful, larger by just a bit than what I anticipated. Usually it‚Äôs opposite you order something off of amazon and it‚Äôs smaller(looking at my microwave and that dish set I bought off here) than you expect. Quality seems really nice for the price you pay. And the engraving is deep with good craftsmanship. I would recommend purchasing this necklace, it‚Äôs well worth the price.",1
5,"I got these for work to be able to read a piece of paper, look at my computer, and look across the room all without taking off my reading glasses (or looking over them, I hate that look!). The work perfectly and saves me spending hundreds of dollars on prescription multifocus glasses. Of course, if your eyes are not evenly going bad, one eye far worse than the other, these will not work for you. But for most of us, they will work just fine. And don't worry about the yellow lines...all three pairs I have bought it was just a piece of cling plastic that came off without any marks. Will buy again!",1
1,Sequins are attached poorly and falling off in package. Returned item.,0
1,"snags my arm hair, had to return",0
5,Not quite the same pattern just placed differently on hat from picture,1
2,"Bought a dress for each daughter- ages10 & 4. Bought a size 10 and a size 6. Both sizes were entirely too big in the chest, straps and underarm. Bought an 8 and a 4. The length was much shorter and still were too big in the straps and chest. Returning all 4. The dresses are pretty so it's unfortunate that the sizing is so terrible.",0
1,"This dress is not what it is portrayed to be! The pink skirt and the pink stripes are two totally different pinks (one is a pink and the other is more of a coral)! The skirt is also a very shiny, silky type of fabric. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",0
4,"Most reviewers said the slippers ran a bit small, so at size 8.5E-9.5D depending on the manufacturer, I went with a size 10.  Turns out it's loose in the heel, but tight across the front of my foot.  I should have gone with the 9 and just hoped the front stretched enough to comfortably accommodate me.  That's the fit.<br /><br />Regarding comfort, they are awesome, like little warm clouds embracing my feet (except not so tightly on the heel, see above.)  Since I won't be doing much more than shuffling around the house in these the great comfort outweighs the slightly imperfect fit.",1
5,Love it,1
3,"Great,  would give it 5 if the lock system was stronger",0
5,I love these belts.  It takes a little bit to break in the buckle but one you do they work flawlessly.  This is the best belt I have ever owned.  I loved this one so much that i bought two more.,1
3,Very big.,0
5,"It's a little small -not uncomfortably or attractively so- I would simply prefer if it were available one size up. I absolutely love it though! Super comfortable, seriously sexy!!!",1
1,To small for adult ears.  I would have returned but need gifts,0
3,easily tears,0
3,"I would like to say this is a great product..however it is to big for my 5 almost 6 year old. It falls down off of her nose and mouth and obviously during ""COVID"" times this is unacceptable.  The print is adorable which is very unfortunate, she was very excited to wear something more comfortable to school.",0
5,"Very well made, good materials also",1
4,"I love the feel of these pants. They are very soft and comfy and don‚Äôt feel like any of my other pajama pants. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, however, and even with these things pulled up to my belly button they are still touching the ground. I still wear them though!",1
4,"These are beautiful earrings, strong, artsy, however, they a little too heavy for me.  Hard to wear too long or more than a few hours.",1
1,The jewel fell off within a few hours..,0
5,Super cute fun and comfy,1
5, ,1
2,Nothing like the picture. No sequins or sparkles. I got a large and it‚Äôs tight but stretches. It didn‚Äôt cost that much so that‚Äôs good. Colors don‚Äôt look like the picture either. Disappointed,0
1,"Came  flat as a pancake, no way to make it look like a baseball hat, directly to garbage.",0
5,A finely made hat that I am proud to wear.,1
5,Very cute dress. Falls right above knees. It's important to follow chest sizes for perfect fit,1
2,too highly priced for the make (((((,0
5,I am 5ft 3in 180lbs bought the xl. I felt beautiful. It fit perfict. Was a little long but I am short lol. The plastic did smell a little so I washed it in cold and hung dry before I wore it. Quality is awesome it is thick material and heavy. Highly recommend.,1
3,They were pretty. I would have preferred the silver to shine more.,0
2,"These are NOT 8mm beads.  6mm at best,  It's a good size for women, not men.",0
4,Nice finish. Stong magnet.  Does pull hair on your arm,1
1,Cheap fabric,0
3,"These slippers aren't nearly as sturdy as they appear in pictures. They're warm, soft & comfy but they won't last long ~ & after only two weeks I'm feeling the fluffy foot-bed wimp out & start to bunch up. Someone asked if the turned-down ankle cuff can be turned up; the answer is that the back cuff can be turned up against your ankle, but the front is tacked down & won't turn up. Last, I chose my size carefully & they fit beautifully at first. But in two weeks they've stretched & flopped to the point that they're far too large & I have to wear big socks (or give them to my husband). Keep this in mind & maybe get a size smaller than you think you need.",0
2,Run really small.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and ordered an XL and they are really short waisted and too short legged.,0
5,I was so excited to receive this Apple Watch band. Will be honest it‚Äôs extremely tight and I purchased the large. Hoping with enough time it will ease up and stretch out to be more comfortable.<br />Giving a length of trial,1
3,"Loves how online it shows this necklace twinkling and moving, however mine does not unless it is a certain position that is not on my neck",0
1,Poor quality,0
4,"I purchased this dress for a co-worker's Wedding in September. I thought the color was perfect for the time of year. When I received my dress I immediately tried it on. It was a little lighter in color than I expected it to be. It said the dress was burgundy but on the lighter side I guess. When it comes to finding the best size, you definitely want to go by how big your bust is because the rest of the dress is pretty roomy going down towards the hips and butt. I did notice tht it was a little tighter at the top of my stomach, a little under the bust area. Other than that I adored this dress and it was so comfortable to dance in. Definitely recommend!",1
5,Love It,1
5,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter,  great quality and it fits her perfectly.  Originally I bought it assuming it would be to large and she could leave it hang on her dresser until she grew into it...  That was not the case.",1
5,"The pajamas were what I‚Äôve been looking for because I wanted a longer top. I only wish there were more choices in my size - Medium.. hopefully they‚Äôll restock all of the prints in all sizes and if so, I would order another set!",1
4,"I bought this as a nice t shirt to wear under a sweater or jacket. The fabric of this shirt is nice and it looks good. However, it's not very ""tailored"" and is a bit loose on me.  I'm 5 ' 10 "" and around 160 to 165  lbs. (at least I was before this pandemic).  I haven't washed it yet, but the medium shirt measures 21 1/2 inches across at the waist. That's 43 inches around at the waist, so I wouldn't call this tailored unless you are larger than I am.  I also bought a mock turtleneck that measures 23 1/2 across the waist and it is also baggy on me. The fabric is nice and the shirts are comfortable, so I'm keeping both.",1
5,"Bought this hat as a gift, and he LOVES it......think he's worn it everyday!!!!  It really does look terrific on him.",1
2,I looked inside before trying this on my granddaughter because it looked big. Well I do t know when a 6-8 became a large.<br />This is so big on her. And she needs it in 3 days for Christmas dance show. So I guess I have to take it in.,0
5,"I didn't know what to expect but this scarf fit the bill in color, quality and size.  Looks great tied simply around your neck - add a navy coat and a beret and it will be tres chic!",1
1,"Mala calidad de la tela, el tama√±o no es  uniforme ya que la parte de arriba est√° perfecta, pero abajo es m√°s ancho de lo normal.",0
1,"Was excited about this purchase . Looked good for the price when it arrived . However , I can't wear it because I can't get the clasp to open . Tried and tried but to no avail ...not even worth contacting customer service about so will just cut my losses. Buyer beware I guess .",0
4,Great watch and a time tested design. Excellent value. But too small for a man - I went for the entry level gshock instead for forty bucks and love it. My 3 year old has this one now.,1
5,Gorgeous! They sparkle!,1
5,My kid loves these dresses. They are pretty durable & comfortable. They are well loved.,1
5,Perfect for my 7 year old's bday party. The girls loved that they all matched.,1
5,6 inch inseam means that these are shorter shorts and look great!  Not she sloppy shants that many men wear nowadays. Fine Polo quality.,1
1,Turn green immediately cheap,0
5,This was exactly as described and perfect to put on a jacket or bag.  The stitching looks well done.,1
1,"Don‚Äôt buy this, it‚Äôs cheaply made, flimsy and huge, it‚Äôs not a baby hat it‚Äôs an upside down wicker planter. Omg I just decided I could add plastic liners and plant flowers. Ok there.. they are worth something now so I don‚Äôt have to risk my life returning it at the post office.",0
2,Does not run true to size.. Way too small..,0
5,Liked,1
5,Really happy with this. The material is lovely and soft.<br />I got a medium and it fits as I expected. I have a big butt and it‚Äôs a bit snug over my butt but I just tucked the front into my leggings and it was fine. I prefer loose fitting cloths so may order 1 size up so it‚Äôs bigger over my butt.,1
3,"It's not as heavy as I think. And the golden color is a little bit bright. Totally,It's OK.",0
5,More than I expected,1
5,"As expected for the price.  Good quality product.  Furr doesn't seem to be falling off.  Obviously not real furr.<br />It's a great investment for a costume.  Quite Large on a child, made for adults.  Would buy again.  Timely delivery.",1
4,"She wore it backwards in the photo uploaded (oops! She was too excited to try them on!), so it‚Äôs a scoop neck on the front actually. We love that it‚Äôs a 2-piece because she wears the tutu skirt with everything for fun. The bodysuit is form fitting and though fitting her little 2T body perfectly, she complained that she was itchy somewhere. The material is smooth, but not as soft as this other ballerina bodysuit we bought (another brand). Overall we love the purchase.",1
2,Got this for daughter for open to elements job. Way too thin. She wants more cotton/wool flannel fabric not polyester feel,0
4,"Got this dress for church. Great fabric with good stretch. 5'4"" 200lbs L. Fit perfect",1
5,I love this hat! I have a huge head and it is super stretchy. I ended up buying a second one and one for my daughter. Works well in the water as well.,1
1,"Sold it. Despite picking the correct size actor the chart, it was way too short and tight for me",0
5,"I got these for a backup pair but they are really nice, soft, comfortable and keep my ears toasty on my early morning winter walks.",1
1,It‚Äôs very shiny compared to the picture. It‚Äôs more boxy than I was hoping for. In my opinion order down a size. I will be returning.,0
4,I like the band but if you have thin wrist like me. You will want to cut some off. I didn‚Äôt like the extra hanging off. Just make sure you burn the edge a little so it doesn‚Äôt come unravel.,1
3,"Fits small, thought it would be loose fitting but seems to be more fitted then I like.",0
2,I didnt realize this was magnet action only.  you set to the size and then open and close with a little pull tab and magnet.  I didnt like it after 4 days and returned<br /><br />the webbing of the belt is stretchy- good quality but I didnt love that either for this kind of belt,0
5,Straps were too big.,1
5,I got this to wear to a wedding and loved it! So comfortable and received a ton of compliments! I would definitely buy again in the other colors!,1
1,"This dress is absolutely awful.<br />I was so excited to find/buy and receive it, but when I received it today, I was only disappointed.<br />The material is SO CHEAP. It is similar to that of a halloween costume. I ordered a small, and it was literally falling off (5'6 and 105 pounds).<br />I was very upset, as I really wanted to love this dress.  The picture makes it look gorgeous and very flattering, but in reality, it is a very cheap dress and I regret buying.  But I guess it is true... you get what you pay for.  I would have very happily spent more money to get a better product/material b/c the form of this dress is great.<br />Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS.",0
3,Cute but wrong size!Could possibly be 7.5.,0
2,Very handsome bracelet. My husband wore only about three times and it broke. Thankfully he found all the beads so I will have to repair myself by buying new line to string beads. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.,0
3,My Grandson has been begging for the blue dog stompeez for months. I finally got them from the manufacturer through Amazon.Service was good and they look fine. I am dissapoited on how hard it is to get the ears to flop all the way up. My five year old has to stomp hard on his heels to get the affect that he's seen in the adds.,0
4,"This took about a month to arrive.  However, the pants are super comfortable and cute.  I'm a size 16, so I usually worry about ordering items that my be Asian sizing, but the XL fits great and hang long enough (I'm 5'8).  Worth the wait.",1
5,Gift,1
2,Nice colors. Nice fit. Won't last long.,0
5,"I ordered 2XL but it fit a little tight.  He has worked for years and is very broad and has large arms; however, he also has a belly.  He would have preferred one size up.  The material was great as well as the style.  They appeared to be well made.",1
5,Comfortable and breathable. Purchased for breastfeeding.,1
1,Ughh poorly made. Too big.,0
1,I got this in September and since I‚Äôm in Texas there really was no use to wear it. So I washed it and hung it up. Today the first cold front blows through and I went to get it out of the closet AND THE DAMN THING DOES NOT ZIP!!!,0
5,Bought this for my mom as a Mother's Day gift and she loves it. She loved how it was a mama elephant with her two babies following along which represents my brother and me following her. The necklace fit great around her neck and was very easy to get on. She also liked the beautiful rose gold of it which matched perfectly with a lot of her outfits. She said it was the highlight of her Mother's Day she loved it so much.,1
2,"Fit nice, but after a few uses the Brest area changed color!  Can‚Äôt use.",0
5,The people that I gave these to loved them.,1
1,"It came flat, don‚Äôt buy it",0
1,These are not sleep shirts . They are way too short. Also one has a hole in it. Waatw of money.,0
1,AVOID,0
5,Love them,1
2,I should have returned them.,0
5,Using for gingerbread decorating with grandchildren,1
3,It not the right material was,0
2,Not flexible and i only got 12! They fit tight which is good but I could only get 3 on! They turn quick it hasn't been 2hrs since I put one in and it turned. You can smell the material when it turns. The others are in my ears.,0
4,"This is a worthwhile upgrade to the Casio MDV106.  It was a little more challenging to install than anticipated.  In order to complete the task, I had to purchase a springbar tool.  I had tried unsuccessfully using a small precision screw driver but just couldn't maneuver the springbar into lug holes of the Casio case.  I figure that I had wasted at least an hour before giving up.  After the springbar tool arrived, both endpieces were in place within 10 minutes.  Also, I found removing the end pieces from the bracelet greatly simplified the task.<br /><br />Regarding the bracelet, don't expect OEM quality.  It's OK but rather jangly.  Most disappointing was the limited adjustment provided.  I can't get an ideal fit. There are only two micro adjustment holes on the clasp. It's either too loose using the inner hole or too tight removing a link and using the outer adjustment hole.  May not be a problem depending upon your wrist size and personal preference.<br /><br />One other issue, if you have small wrists, this may not work for you with the Casio.  I have 7 1/4&#34; and removed all the adjustment links.  It is a little snug using the outer adjustment hole. I think anyone with under 7&#34; wrists may not be satisfied if installing on the Casio.<br /><br />With all that being said, definitely worth the $10-11 cost.",1
2,I did not like the material it is made out if. Will probably snag easily.,0
5,Nice graphics on shirts.  Fit well.,1
3,"soft light weight fabric,  sleeves too tight,  wrong color green.",0
5,Bought them for my husband and he loves them,1
3,"I'm really torn up about this one.  I love the watch, everything it does is great. But the band itself has caused what looked like chemical burns. I didn't take pictures and my friends told me that was stupid of me. Sadly,  I can't wear it for this reason.",0
5,Great game day bag-approved for stadium use. The zip top is secure and the shoulder strap is adjustable for comfort if wearing during an entire game/event.,1
5,Bought it for my son to keep him warm during his football games. Reasonably priced and fast shipping.,1
5,Surprising quality and packing for the price,1
4,Love this top! Fits well I‚Äôm 5foot3 150 pounds I got a medium,1
2,A bit disappointed in the real versus the picture. It looks more like colored glass than the stone appearance that is advertised.<br />Was attempting to match a stone ring but the earrings appear much too fake.,0
4,"Cute. Exactly how it is described, looks wise. However the &#34;one&#34; in the description leads you to believe it is ONE earring but in truth it is a pair. Just to note. This is a PAIR of earrings. ;) Also, the earrings arrived MAJOR early too (which is always nice)!",1
5,"My wife loves this top. She's cold-natured, so a lightweight sweater top like this is her best friend for chilly restaurants and cool Fall nights. It's 95% polyester and 5% spandex, which makes it comfortable, with just enough flex to allow it to move with her. It's well-made and the size runs true. She got the black one, which goes well with anything, and she loves it. She says try it, you'll like it.",1
5,Received my bag. Absolutely Love it !<br />Inner zipper not sewn completely but fortunately something I am able to do.<br />Worth the price,1
5,Fit is a little large lengthwise. I purchased the S/XS. I am 5' 1&#34; tall and normally wear a 7 in running shoes. The extra length was not uncomfortable but it did tend to squeeze the toes together a bit.,1
3,"Gorgeous dress, somewhat small but that was expected. Very short, almost too short. The width of the mesh in between the skirt and top looks much longer in the picture, as well as the seams stick out in the mesh, make it look even shorter in the middle. It is obviously supposed to be hidden inside the dress but is not. The seams should be sewed down to one side or the other and are not. They just flap around.",0
5,"A little bit lighter color than the picture but still a wonderful piece! Heavy, with cute shell clasp in back. At first I was worried it might not hold the weight, but it's made well and is sturdy. I am complimented on them whenever I go out. Of all my pearls my husband has complemented me on these the most. They are really worth having. Dress them up or down, wear them year round! So versatile.  Shipped fast, would buy again!",1
5,"These pajamas are so comfortable! I ordered the leopard print in my usual size and they fit fine. The shirt is more form fitting, but has some spandex so is stretchy and comfortable. The pants fit a little bigger so they‚Äôre a little baggy and long, but still comfortable. WASH CARE: hand wash, line dry or dry clean. I washed in gentle cycle and hung to dry.",1
2,wanted to use this to remove a stain on my yellow suede purse due to some denim rub-off. no english instructions on product. arrived as a brick in a box with foreign language instructions. read other comments for a clue and proceeded to work on my purse. stain is still there. maybe a little fainter but still very much there.,0
5,He likes the colors & the material. He lifts weights & shows off his muscles,1
1,This item was listed as a 6-9 month size and when I received it the label was 9 months.,0
2,It's a really cute swim suit but it has no support on the top and is very easy to become lose.,0
2,"When I first got this and tried it on, it fit fine.  The second I washed it, it shrank like 4 inches and now is too short on me.  I washed it on warm/cold, and the dryer was on perm press.  Everything else I own doesn't shrink with those settings.  This is the only shirt that did.  I'm bummed because it was a cute shirt and I was looking forward to wearing it, but now I can only use it as an undershirt.",0
3,I just didn't like the bathrobe type material. It was too silky and would be better worn as a poolside dress.,0
3,More yellowish looking than gold,0
5,"This necklace is beautiful! It has more of an eggplant hue than it appears in the photo. It falls gracefully right below the collarbone. After buying this for myself, I definitely plan on buying more as gifts. This was obviously crafted by some very skilled women! What a wonderful way to help these women lift their families out of poverty!",1
5,Beautiful watch and thank you for the little gift,1
2,One of the players on the shirt is unknown!! Not authentic!!,0
5,I love it! Just as described,1
5,It‚Äôs faceted and gives off a beautiful sparkle.  I have paired with my multi colored tourmaline bracelet which is also sown in this pic. The adjustable cord is strong and well done and beaded on the ends. I definitely recommend this!,1
4,"The dress is comfortable, it fits the curves of the body, and looks sexy! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and comes just below the knees. The downside is the stitching of the pocket ripped after one wash but otherwise, I really like the dress",1
5,These things are so great! Surprisingly comfortable - so much more than similar products. I tried them to sleep at night - I barely noticed they were there. These are going to come in so handy on a 10-hr international flight we have coming up. I highly recommend them!

5,Great product. Comfortable and good material.,1
4,good for save currency,1
3,"This hat looks like the picture. I would have liked it more if it were a little bit bigger. I consider my head average. This is one hat that if you wear it, you will not be able to take it off  until you get home because your hair will be a disaster.",0
3,Not the color I was expecting. Way more salmon/coral.,0
5,Purchased for my mom after she broke her ankle.  Now she won‚Äôt trip and can easily move with her walking boot.  She loves them and the 3/4 length sleeves.,1
1,"Very thin fabric, no sunblocking whatsoever.  I paid $70 to Amazon and the tag that was attached to the umbrella was for $ 34.99 from The Christmas Tree Shop.  WHAT A DEAL!!!",0
5,You can put the hat in your pocket when not in use. It's easy to fold and unfold.,1
5,They are warm,1
1,Poor quality!!! Not as expected!,0
4,"Nice, a little big, but my son will grow into it.",1
3,"Fit a little smaller if you have a larger waist. They fit thighs perfect but I could have sized up.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6, 250 lb and got 2x",0
3,"Ok so i bought these because i have  similar pants by Lululemon and wanted a cheaper pair to wear to dance practice. these are a decent knock off. They are comfy and long, and a good loose fit in the leg.  The problem is the draw string on the bottom of the leg.  it pulls fine but then the string you have pulled becomes too long.  It doesnt draw up into the pant like the others i have.  So you end up with this string hanging down that i tripped on dancing and almost fell. so you have to pull the string and then tuck it up into the pant somehow.  Its odd.  I may just cut the string a bit and just tie a new knot. Hope this helps. I would still buy them again.",0
4,Love these!,1
5,Love it. I get tons of compliments!,1
5,"If you are an eBiker, you will enjoy this cap. It keeps you head warm in the winter and also keeps your AirPod secure. I list my few of my AirPod while riding eBike with wearing this cap. The AirPod just fell off. This cap secure them in place and also warm your head, this kill two birds with one stone, you know what I meant.",1
5,Love it. Fits a larger neck very comfortably.,1
4,"Very nice product,the design is superb,started using it strataway,only thing is the casing doesn‚Äôt wrap fully around the phone,not a defect,just how the design is,wish it could cover that inch or so around the screen,not a big deal though,still very well made and i might just get another design in the very near future",1
2,Material was thinner than expected,0
2,Beautiful watch  but consistently runs slow,0
5,Love my new dress! Great material. Fits as described.,1
5,"I was very happy with the camo joggers (with fleece liner) because they were warm, comfy, and stylish.  They do have a shiny-ish look to the outside, but that has helped to repel my dog‚Äôs hair from sticking as much. I ordered the small and these were true to size.<br /><br />I was extremely happy with the 1st pair so I bought a small black pair with fleece liner.  These joggers are a different material, definitely thicker, the inside of these are made out of a velvety-soft material .  Outside of joggers is not a shiny finish, more like cotton.<br /><br />Very pleased with both pairs because I‚Äôve needed some warm pants that I can stay warm outside when I walk my dog but not overheat inside the house.  I would recommend them.",1
1,"Kind of frustrated with this particular shirt...I ordered brown, what showed up doesn‚Äôt look brown. It‚Äôs looks like a muddy purple-ish/maroon-ish color. I have these shirts in multiple colors and love them! But, I wanted brown, not whatever this other color is!!",0
5,The pendant are really nice.,1
1,It came with no top. And was the last in stock. Very disappointed.,0
1,"Received BLACK owls, not these. Very disappointed. Lost one that first day trying them out so I couldn't even return them!",0
1,If they we're the color I ordered would be much better there brown I hate brown but to much trouble to send back...oh well..TRAVIS,0
1,I bought a second pair and they are not the same. These I cannot even put on my foot they do not fit at all.<br /><br />I never thought I would wear socks like this but dam they make my legs feel so dang good,0
1,Mine ripped when we used it,0
1,Ridiculously small. Returned.,0
5,Great fit !!! Nice color,1
5,For the price they are great. Look good on.,1
1,Order 2 sizes bigger than what you are.,0
5,"This was a perfect easy costume to wear. It is not metal but fabric. The size seems to be pretty true, I got a medium and I am 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs. Looked great.",1
5,Love it!!!! I got the silver tone one. It's so cute and pretty. It is SO MUCH easier to put in than the stupid ball ones because it snaps!!,1
5,"I ordered this dress for my daughter who wanted to dress as Lana Del Rey for Halloween. The dress came in as expected. It fit beautifully and not only does it make for a great Lana Del Rey, it is also a pretty dress that can be worn to a party. I really like it.",1

5,Only regret not ordering more than one.  The details were perfect.,1
2,"I liked this design, but I'm a 10 and order the XL and I could not zip the skirt. The jacket would have torn if I moved at all. Don't get it if you're bigger than an 8. My sister put the jacket on and wears a small and it fit her well (if that tells you anything). Sad it wasn't available in my size.",0
3,"The bracelet arrived in good time.  However, upon arrival, the bracelet I received looked entirely different from the picture.  It was tarnished to the point of being black overall, showing nothing of the pattern. As I removed the tarnish, the pattern became visible and is the same as presented except the bracelet appears the same color overall, not highlighting the distinctive pattern.",0
1,"Didn't expect much so not too disappointed, but still a 1 star review as they broke with gentle cleaning after a couple of months. Ugly as hell, and the frame is much wider than the lens, and rubberized, which makes cleaning them a pain, and quick to fog.<br /><br />Low quality.",0
5,I like everything about these.,1
5,She loved it,1
5,Received it quickly and it was perfect. Initially concerned about the one size fits all because wife is a bit larger (like one of the pictures) but it fits and she loves it.,1
5,Wash and wear. Comfortable,1
5,"This dress is amazing. I can't say enough good things about it. The color is gorgeous, the neckline is unique and eye catching and the fit is perfect - form fitting yet classy.  I wore it to wear for a work event and received so many compliments - one of my clients ended up buying it for his wife! I ended up wearing it to the Kentucky Derby and also received tons of compliments. Felt amazing in it. Buy this dress :)",1
3,Very comfy! Great for lounging!,0
1,"Love the pattern! The band itself is comfortable enough if it weren‚Äôt for the two plastic ‚Äúnubs‚Äù on the underside that rub again sat the wrist bone. I tried filing them down, but still bothersome. Worst of all, the band is too wide for the 38mm watch even though the description says it fits. The razor-sharp corners stick out on each side just enough to catch on everything and become dangerous. I tried on 2 watches and it fits the same on series 1&3",0
5,"Used this to make an Elsa wig! Color is beautifully snow white, and it really is heat resistant. LOVE.",1
2,"The shirt is not white, more of a yellow color. Bought to wear under white dress, in contrast, definitely stood out as yellow. Mine arrived as if it was a prior return. Broken tags, none attached and were torn in bag. Didn't have enough time to return and exchange. It was for an international trip.",0
2,The stud earrings are MICROSCOPIC. I literally had to put reading glasses on to see them. They're ridiculously small.,0
4,"I really love this device. I haven't done like the video and tried dropping it from 6 ft high, nor throw it around, but for normal, careful usage, it does its protection deal. Getting the correct amount of air in it is tricky though because you tend to blow air into it while it is standing up, but you probably will pack it into something lying on its side, and, of course, gravity will have that heavy bottle changing the distribution of the air cushion.<br />I've used this to pack wine and fly all over the country and nothing has broken so far, so I'm happy!",1
5,got for nieces birthday she loved it,1
5,Love the pockets,1
3,The fit was awesome but it was delivered with a small whole in the rear so I had to return it.  But I would buy it again!,0
5,"I was looking for a Tricorn hat for a Colonial period costume. This was just the look I wanted and it was listed in it's circumference (size adult large) and was perfect for me as I have a large oval-shaped head!  I received it in perfect condition protected by the box and was very surprised to see a &#34;crafted in USA&#34; label. Very pleased with the quality, price and design plus the communication from the Jacobson Hat Company.",1
4,Runs small but cute dress,1
5,"Glasses are super cute, comfy, and great sun protection!  Would buy again!",1
2,Beautiful purse but cheaply made. After a month of use its already starting to come apart at the seams. Material is fraying at seams and the faux leather is peeling. Low price & you get what you pay for I guess. I would recommend just going to the Gun store and purchasing a better quality.,0
3,Hard to put on in a way that looks cute.,0
5,perfect,1
3,Nice but material is suuper thin so I returned it,0
1,Fell apart a week after I received them!,0
5,"I purchased this for my husband of two years for Christmas as a replacement wedding ring since he lost his. It arrived a bit after Christmas, which is fine because some of the things he purchased for me arrived late as well. I was so excited to see how it looked in person, as I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it (just like my husband.) When I opened it I noticed something on the top flap of the cardboard box. Much to my surprise, the sellers of the ring took their services a step above the rest by including a personal message and reminding me that if the ring didn't fit to contact them immediately. This little bit extra that they put into the packaging made me smile from ear to ear. I opened the cute, little red ring box and couldn't believe my eyes. I was almost in tears by how beautiful the ring had turned out to be. I was so pleased with the turnout that I took pictures of the ring for a good 30min to an hour. After getting some &#34;glamour shots&#34;, I began wrapping the box in not one, not two, but four different layers, just to build the suspense for my husband. I couldn't help but to smile like the Cheshire cat at him as he unfurled the layers of wrapping paper. I believe he was speechless for a few seconds because all he did was look at the ring and smile before saying thank you to me. I pointed out the inscription on the inside of the cardboard parcel and he thought it was very thoughtful as well. I am glad he was as pleased with his new ring as I was. :)",1
5,My children say these the most comfortable water shoes ever.,1
5,Love them!!!!,1
1,It broke during shipment so I was not able to use it.,0
5,Love it!,1
5,"This combo pack is amazing for beginners like me. It comes with 2 picks and safety locks just like listed. The material is fairly cheap but it seems to be able to hold the weight of an electric guitar so far. The installation was very easy, I thought it would be a lot harder. I didn't want to invest too much in a new hobby as I have commitment issues so this is a very good starter kit due to its affordability. The strap is soft and doesn't dig into my skin, the picks aren't much to comment on, but the safety locks are amazing, they fill the perfect amount of space needed on the button attatchments! Overall, worth the price",1
2,The skirt is completely see-through. Would not recommend.,0

5,Awesome gloves and very warm as well!,1
3,"Im a 34D, about 130lbs, and 5'4"", I bought a medium and it fits nicely. The length is a little short, it's in between a crop top and a regular length shirt. It would pair nicely woth high-waisted or tucked in. I haven't washed it yet, but it was a little itchy when I tried it on.",0
1,"I hop d this mask would work well with hearing aids, but my hair stuck out terribly.",0

3,It fits funky. I think they made it too big and there's no shape to it. I feel like I'm wearing a trash bag.,0
5,"This looks like a double strand but it's really a 12"" doubled over into a bracelet, versatile.  Also, the gems are way prettier than the pictures, very sparkly and not cheap looking.  Very nice.",1
3,It is not soft nor does it provide any coverage. Who cares? It's cheep and durable enough to survive a wild Halloween.,0
5,Nice quality product. Great price,1
2,"They are very cute and pretty. I got complements. However, the one with the pearl, which I put in my right ear, started to feel burning and itching almost immediately. I took it out after just a couple minutes, but my ear got more red and swollen all day. It finally went away overnight.<br />I give it 2 stars because they look like the picture. Too bad they're impossible to wear.",0
4,Sharp jacket; so far so good.  Read reviews about zipper issues; I have been careful with mine and haven‚Äôt had any issues.  The zipper does work rather stiffly so I have been gentle with it.,1

2,not long enough,0
3,This bag looks exactly like the picture on Amazon. It's cute and petite but didn't wow me. Would be great for a hipster looking for something vintage-y without the thrift store smell. Might even be good as a man purse...murse....man bag...you know what I mean.<br />I imagine it would age beautifully. I was getting it for a trip to Europe and the closure didn't feel secure enough for me. Just a magnetic snap. No zipper inside.<br />I've never had my pocket picked but I've had a few friends who have and now I'm vigilant about making sure my bag closes. Even at home in L.A.<br />I sent it back but it wasn't because it wasn't cute.,0
5,perfect fit size 12,1
5,awesome,1
3,I have hats from this company that I like a lot. This jacket was a bit of a let down to me because I assumed it would be a lot warmer. It has the thinnest layer of wool on the inside of the garment making it just a base layer on cold days or suitable as a jacket when it‚Äôs a bit cool out. It‚Äôs well made though and I still like the company a lot.,0

5,They were bent really bad when I got them just had time to open them,1
5,ILLOVE IT,1
1,Terrible shoes. Fit nicely as expected but did serious damage to my feet. I wore them to work for half a day and had to put bandaids under the straps due to excessive cutting. Bruises developed later that night where the straps had been. They rub horribly and where the straps cross puts a LOT of pressure on your feet. I work with children and they were actually freaked out when they noticed blood going down my feet. Wish I could return but I wore them out so I doubt I can.,0
3,"Ame el dise√±o y su significado por eso lo adquir√≠, lo uso con bastante frecuencia y noto con el paso del tiempo que ya el producto est√° enrojecido por un lado, ya no luce tan bien, pens√© que era de mejor calidad",0
4,Love everything about this except for the padding sewn in. The padding is poor quality and I ended up cutting the fabric to remove the pads.,1
5,"These earrings are smaller than I thought, which I really love! I wasn't sure if they would look too &#34;gaudy&#34; and too large to wear . I was happy with the size (you can see in my pictures). These earrings add a boho feel to your outfit when you wear them, which is always a hot trend for fall. The metal is a bit warmer, more of a rose gold color to me. It's also not as polished as it looks in the pictures and has a darker wash around the little studs. The crescent shape is really unique and with the smaller studs around it really make it stand out on your ears. They are not heavy and don't weight your earlobe down. When I wear mine I forget I'm actually wearing earrings. These are a fun way to add a little &#34;extra&#34; to your outfit.",1
1,"Got the XL, would fit a 12 year old I suppose, don't buy if you are an adult......",0
3,"I love the ponytail hole and the design on the hat, but the hat seems to stretch out as you wear it. When first putting it on, it fits nice and snug, but as the day goes on it‚Äôs loose, even with Velcro tightened in back.",0
5,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 105 lbs. I bought the XS. These pants are very comfortable!! I honestly wish they were a tiny bit smaller but they still fit nicely. I would say my more normal weight of around 112 would fit these PERFECTLY, but I lose a lot of muscle in the winter season.",1
5,Beautiful watch. dials are easy to read and setting it simple.,1
3,The model in the add must have skinny arms the sleeves looked longer than they are.,0
5,"Great hat!  I have one for golf and another for fishing.  It holds its shape and is amazing.  I've also used it when working in the garden at 100 degrees,  it really keeps you cool.  I don't have a lot of hair on top so I don't know how well it would work otherwise.",1
1,I feel like items sold in US should match typical sizes closely.  This is not an American-sized large,0
5,"Perfect fit, they stay up and do not bunch up at the bottom. Love them.",1
1,Nice but run very small,0
1,"Great until it broke after two weeks of use.  Buckle held together by pins, of which, one just fell out.",0
1,"Awful compression, don‚Äôt waste your money. Hit Dicks and get a quality pair.",0
3,"I purchase this skirt in large and it fit, however I returned it. Because I decided to go with another outfit. Over all it is not a bad skirt just not my favorite of all the long skirts I have bought. The material was ok, and I wasn't fond of the skirt in the front.. for reference my waist is about 38(With my body shaper on it drops 2 to 3 inches) and I usually wear medium or large in skirts depending on the manufacturer.<br />I didn't really give the skirt a chance because I had decided to go with something else before it was delivered. So by no means let my opinion change your view about giving it a chance.",0
5,"High quality! We love this belt! We own a waterfront marine construction business, and it‚Äôs a great play on our industry at events.",1
5,"If you need a good belt and you're changing sizes, then you've come you the correct item, it's perfect.<br />This is the 2nd belt of this kind that we bought. They're very soft and a nice material, the buckle is nice too.<br />I do recommend READING the instruction BEFORE cutting to size as my son did read but skimmed thru...ended up cutting 5 inches too short so that's why I bought this one, my husband has the other. I have to say hubby is rough on his work clothes and this belt had held up oh I think he's had his 6+ months now.",1
1,It looked cheesy and smaller than  the other hat we have that measures the same size. My bad for the price I will pay more for better next time.,0
4,Not bad and nifty colors.,1
1,Product is okay- company however is horrible. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend ordering from them.,0
4,Too see-through.  Also not pink.  More of a purply-pink,1
5,The leggings were very tight not sure if they are suppose to be this way,1
5,Love these for summer time.,1
5,Bought this for a friend for her birthday. We are Lucy & Ethel!,1
4,"I've been looking for a decent, actually warm hooded sweatshirt and I came across this one. The reviews were good and they suggested to buy a size up. I range between medium and large US sizes in tops, so I got an XL because I like my hoodies to be a little loser. This one fits nearly perfectly if I wanted a form fitting shirt. I still love it, still wear it a bunch, but it is definitely way smaller than I expected. If I buy a second one, I'll be going up yet another size.<br />Beyond the sizing, it's warm, comfy, sturdy, withstanding potential damage from my cats climbing over my shoulders. I'm definitely not upset with the purchase, just wish it had been a little larger.",1
1,Overpriced chinese garbage. As others have stated the lenses are pretty pathetic as far as protection goes and they look flat out ugly as hell! like some cheap gas station glasses. Just another upstart company trying to compete with the big boys. If you think these are worth $159 then you have zero room to bitch about the prices of Oaklies and other name brands that use quality materials and have killer lenses.,0
5,I love this necklace it's very comfortable to wear and it has multiple clasps to make it smaller or larger.,1
3,"cute for one time use, after being worn once I had to throw away cause stretch of wearing it caused it to fray.  Also buttons unsnap randomly.",0
3,"I had to return. I like this brand a lot (it is typically well made), but the green color was a little darker than I expected, and the sleeves me feel a little witchy.",0
5,Very cute for Christmas,1
1,"This is not a linen shirt, it is 100% cotton. Product runs small so size up.",0
5,BEAUTIFUL! Can‚Äôt wait to order more!,1
5,"Losing weight as I walk or do yoga, when wearing this thinner belt...I may drip sweat and get wet but the weight comes off and it's almost time for Christmas in HI...",1
5,"No complaints. Right fabric and length for the tropics. They wash well, Girls live in them",1
3,The fit on this hat is small..my head isn't that big and struggled to get it on.,0
2,Too small,0
5,Exactly what I wanted. Very n,1
1,they were broke and poorly made,0
1,Broke the first day of use. Will return for refund when my daughter gets back from her trip she needed this case for.,0
5,"I think I have 12 of these yoga pants in various colors, with and without pockets and I just love them. They are thick, wear well, and hold their shape. They stretch very well, I buy extra small and have worn them between 110 pounds and 125 with no issue. I love them!",1
3,I noticed the neck strap didn't come with it.,0
4,"I received the beige umbrella despite ordering the dark green.  However, my wife is pleased with it and it seem to create sufficient sun blocking, so I am sticking with the beige.  The workmanship looks very good, and most of the parts appear to be well made and sturdy.  It is prone to catch the wind, and despite adding a water-filled base, it has blown over in our central Florida breezes.  A base or securing it into your deck directly is very necessary.  Assembly was easy, though the directions consisted of small illustrations only, no verbal step-by-step.  I will update as I gain experience with this umbrella.  The shade it provides is exactly what I was hoping for.",1
3,I ordered these around 6 months ago and ive broken 2 of them. Very cute and comfy but you get what you pay for!,0
3,"Very cute dress, fits well with a jean jacket. I'm a little disappointed that stitching at the lower seam had some puckering going on there. But that's an easy fix.  Overall it fits comfortably.  I'm size 14 and ordered 2XL.",0
2,"Not the correct size to small, never had to send any shoes back before this pair and I buy over.",0
5,Great material. Great fit.  Wore for Christmas and received a ton of compliments!,1
1,"So VERY disappointed. This is not worth the money. The engraving cannot be seen! Was told I will get a replacement, but have not seen it yet. I am 75 and need a magnifying glass to see the print‚Ä¶.lost my husband in Nov. and wanted it as a memorial ring. Waste of my money!",0
3,Size was much smaller than should be. Fourth time wearing and the embellishments started falling off as I was rounding the belt loops. I am very delicate with my things because I appreciate when I am able to treat myself.,0
4,Ordered a kids size medium and it‚Äôs more of a men‚Äôs small. I could wear it and it would be loose. I couldn‚Äôt change the size but my son is 57‚Äù and 62 lbs. the shirt was for him.,1
3,"I purchased the Brown and Navy in in size Large.<br />Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched:<br />Chest underarm to underarm 22""<br />Length shoulder to hem 28""<br />Across hem 17""<br />Sleeve length shoulder seam to cuff 25""<br />Across shoulders sleeve seam to seam 18""<br /><br />My husband wears a size large in basic relaxed t-shirts, 32x32 jeans, and this sweater fit like a relaxed large. The sweater is a medium weight stretch knit. The knit is small and tight so I think with a base layer it would be quite warm. It's really really soft on the outside, smooth but not quite as soft on the inside. Overall for the price, I paid $12.99 plus tax and free Prime shipping, it's a well made good quality sweater.<br /><br />**UPDATE - Cold wash and hang to dry with no shrinkage but it pilled all over. Made it look very worn and old. Navy sweater already developed a hole in one sleeve. I originally rated these 4 stars but due to the pilling I lowered the rating.",0
5,It's a beautiful sweater.,1
3,Bow tie is a lighter color pink than the suspenders. Suspenders are well made and true to color in picture.,0
1,I wasn't sure what to expect for the price...product is poor quality. The straps of the glasses were twisted yet still sewn on that way. You could see the foam that is between the glasses & the hat & the plastic eyeglass part of the glasses had a small crack in one of them. Threw away.,0
5,"They are so comfortable, there perfect fit.",1
4,"It says 3X but it for my 11 yr old and it fits him just a little on the big side , it's like a 3X in a kids size if there was such thing.",1
1,"What I received were 3 BRUSH (not rubber) applicators. They don't look anything like what was advertised. In addition, the 3 rubber applicators show different widths while the brushes I received were all the same size. I already own a brush applicator. I wanted to try a rubber applicator for relaxer application.  Will be returning ASAP!",0
2,"After a few months of use, it started falling apart.",0
2,Earrings are beautiful but they are very small more for like children and one wwas missing from the box,0
5,Fitted perfectly for a 3 year old,1
5,I've been extremely happy with the quality of this bra.,1
2,"Bought these for my son. When he wore them for the first time and pulled his hand out, the finger liners pulled out too. It was very hard to get his hand/fingers into the glove.",0
1,Horrible quality. Used once and broke apart at the seams,0
5,I got this for my granddaughter - she loves it!,1
1,"Nothing like the photo...the back is completely different...it is stitched with white thread,so you can see it. Dont know where these companies get their photos...but at best it's a cheap copy...material issothinits see thru",0
1,"What a waste of time. I have been looking for a nice, old-fashion flannel shirt for months. Most these days are very thin and cut like they're meant to be on a runway. They're flannel shirts, not high fashion. When I saw this men's shirt, I thought &#34;perfect&#34;, this should do nicely.<br />When I received the shirt I was 100% disappointed. The material feels like burlap, not flannel. I ordered a large. This is a men's shirt, so I assumed the large would fit since I wear 14 in ladies/women's. That was not the case. The chest was huge. I could stuff a puppy into the room the chest has, but I cannot button the bottom two buttons. What's up with that? My hips are average, not huge. Why SO much room in the chest but so little room in the waist? I do not recommend this product in any way. The sizing is mysterious at best and the material feels very abrasive.",0
5,I bought this for my son and he loves it.,1
3,"It does fit nice and has good support, but the underwires poke me sometimes.  They are not sticking out, they just feel kind of sharp and irritating.  If that was gone, the bra would be perfect.",0
5,"These are cool...and they fit well. When I searched for &#34;narrow&#34; wayfarer style, I wasn't looking for a pair of sunglasses that were for a narrow face. What I was looking for was a wayfarer style that had lenses that were narrower from top to bottom. I've never liked the way most wayfarers looked on my face because of lens size, but I always liked the cool style. So, I was nervous about the fit, but they are great...so great, after I received my first pair I ordered a second pair just in case I needed a spare! Hope this review helps!",1
2,Fit is strange. I'm not too curvy but I have some shape... I think you have to be a stick figure to look good in this dress.,0
1,"Colors not as pictured or described.  Only option to return is via USPS, with postage costing 1/3 of what the item cost.  Annoyed.",0
5,One of my daughters favorite Christmas present,1
5,"Used these for international flight. My husband's feet felt usually swell with too mush sitting, these socks were great.",1
3,"This looks cool in the picture. It also arrived very late. The picture shows it in charcoal grey. It is actually closer to black. It becomes a &#34;contraption&#34; when trying it on and I have yet to get it to look like it does on the mannequin. I have had it since December and it is in the closet, never worn.",0
3,"Returning,maybe I didnt read right but the flower is humongus and I personally feel will look absurd as an earring",0
3,They kind of took a long time to get to me.<br />I get that they are from China but i have purchased other things from China before and they have gotten to me pretty quickly. The post office wanted me to sign for them and i'm hardly ever home because i have school and work so i had to go pick them up. I don't know if i just have tiny fingers or what but these are like normal rings. Not midi rings. Also all of mine are the same size. I'm definitely going to be wearing these...just not as midi rings. But hey. They were cheap (:,0
3,"nice quality, however the compass is not  accurate. good for jewelry.",0
3,Smaller than expected. I wear about a medium. I ordered a large and I should've ordered an extra large. There's no way I would've got into a medium. The large is tight. I know it's supposed to be a compression shirt but it's tighter than I'd like. I'll still use it.<br />Fabric is thinner than expected too. I'm sure larger size wouldn't stretch at much and feel thicker.,0
3,Um I ordered the yellow and got pink! I thought about returning because I previously ordered yellow and liked it better however it was too small..It runs a small so I‚Äôd suggest going up a size! Like I buy my baby 2t and tht normally has a little bit of room..went with the 2-3 top was too short and shorts probably would‚Äôve only gave us one use..so replaced but got the wrong color..might keep pink still debating..both are cute for summer,0
1,Wretched piece of trash.  First of all the label said XXL I ordered a small (I checked) and it appeared the size of a small.  The material was thinner than bible paper.  The zipper was completely broken.  Returned.,0
5,bought as a gift not sure,1
5,Absolutely beautiful vest! I get many compliments when I wear it.,1
5,Husband loves them very warm and well made,1
5,It is a pretty watch. The glass is so solid.,1
5,"This token is beautifully made, the photo does not do it justice. I gave several away to friends and they loved it as well.",1
1,"First, the pictures shows the shorts with no crotch seam yet it has one. Second, there is too much fabric on the butt area and I have a bigger butt lol. Third, the butt scrunch is ugly and the waist band is just not flattering. Maybe it just doesn‚Äôt look right on my body but I was overall disappointed especially since there ended up being a crotch seam üòí",0
1,Return..<br />Never worked<br />Replaced battery still didn't work,0
1,"Followed instructions for installation... these slipped right off the ankle gasket tool as I was applying the aqua seal adhesive, creating a giant mess and ruining any chance that I had of getting a good seal with these gaskets. I recommend that you stay away from conical shaped gaskets like this and go with the bottleneck style... they are much easier to apply and don't slip off during the application.",0
3,I liked the feel of this dress but it just doesn't lay quite right.  Good enough for a funeral I suppose.,0
5,the shirt looks good and the size is fine,1
1,Horrible.,0
5,Love the pattern,1
3,The quality of cloth is not so good. The package in which I received the dress was wet and smelled.,0
3,Too short..,0
5,Very warm but EXTREMELY UNFLATTERINGüòÇ,1
1,I was sent leggings that do not look like what is pictured but similar. See previous review by another person for a photo of what was actually sent. Really not sure why they don‚Äôt have the proper photo up.,0
2,"I returned it, I am extremely sensitive to the tightness in the band area.  The company was great about the return.<br />This is posted under my husband's name but the bra was mine.",0
2,The picture does not look correct compared to the actual dress. The upper lace looks of a very different and very poor quality considering the price of the dress. We had to send it for repair to remove the lace.<br />It fit a little bit large but we where expecting that.,0
1,I wore one twice and the band strap that holds the little end down broke<br />So I switched to the other band and the same thing happened along with it peeling the color off.  Very cheaply made!,0
4,Love the fit. Im a size 24 and i ordered a 4x. Fits perfectly. I'm kinda tall and the dress hits a about mid calf. Longer than i thought. Material is comfortable.,1
3,"The stretchy fabric is nice and they hug your hips well. Unfortunately I bought these because they are advertised as seamless and no panty line, and they give me major panty line!! There are are definitely prominent seams along the leg holes. The fit is too tight as well buy 1-2 sizes up.",0
2,far too small to be a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù if you get these and are even the slightest bit curvy i‚Äôd be careful and probably size up 2 sizes,0
5,"Fits perfectly, super soft, and comfortable. The pockets are excellent! I love these joggers!",1
1,There is cheap clothes. Then there is this thing.  It looks and feels more like a tarp.  What is pictured is not what I got.  There is no kind of stitching or anything in the front to make it a wearable item.  The &#34;panties&#34; that came with it are way to small for the size you chose.  But then again it doesn't look like size means anything,0
1,"I will be returning this item.  even though marked as XXL, I can barely fit into it, let alone zip it up.  I wear a 10 or 12.  very disappointed",0
5,I loved the material and and shape but ran very small. i usually wear a large but the xlarge was too tight. I would of re-ordered but that was the largest size offered.,1
3,Not Long like picture for tall girl,0
3,"It fit kind of small, but fit as expected in the shoulders.  I liked it a lot actually...the hood is a good size, shoulder fit was great, but it was short.  The waist was kind of high.  Had it been lower I would've kept it and given 5 stars.",0
5,Just what I needed,1
4,"I ordered a size large. From the sizing chart given a large is a size 6. I am almost always a US size 6. I'm 5'11/160lbs/36C, long torso and a 6'0 wingspan, athletic build.  The sleeves are perfect size for my long arms, and hangs down past my hips! If I could reorder, which I probably will, I'll order a medium next time. There is a lot of room in the large, but that's me. So if your around my dimensions, I'd order a Medium.<br />The actual flannel is awesome, super soft and great colors! This will be perfect for Winter in the South.",1
5,It was exactly what I was look for.,1
5,So far so good. I've had it for about two weeks. I just washed it but only hang-dry like I usually do with shirts I dont want wearing out.,1
1,"I ordered this piece TWICE after the first one came broken, and the second chain was ALSO broken. Returning disappointed, since I was hoping to wear this for my engagement party.",0
2,Why didn't I read the reviews!? This band comes undone at the slightest disruption. Not good at all for the gym.,0
5,Well made fits very well.,1
5,Best Flop ever for a size 14.  No smell great year round wet or dry,1
1,"On Monday, 7/1/19  I ordered this beautiful items because in the specification you show and you say that this item are click on and ""Screw Back"".... Yes they are ""click on""  but they are not ""Screw Back"". you ca see the picture.<br />I always use screw back because its more comfortable and safe for me.<br />I am very disappointed because I have a party on Friday afternoon, I have to look for another pair of earring  in a local store and you have my money for 3 to 5 days..... please be precise with the description of your product. Thank you",0
3,I usually wear a Woman's medium.  I like a looser fit so I ordered XL.  They run small.  Much more fitted than I expected.  ;(,0
4,Cool stuff,1
5,"I loved these, and the claw clasp. Holds a variety of sizes in chapsticks which was pleasing as I have different brands that vary large to small. I am giving some as Easter basket gifts.",1
5,"what do you think i used it for ,??my bras",1
5,"Great color, basic sweatshirt. Love it!",1
1,"The watch looked good, but did not fit my wrist.  Might be fine for a child, but not most adults.",0
4,I'm not so sure.  The dress is not horrible but the fabric isn't all that nice.  It's a bit rough but sturdy and will hold up to washings.,1
2,I really wanted to love this shirt but the material felt like a weird spandex.,0
5,I absolutely love it great material and great fit!,1
1,The material of the short set was too thin for me to wear. And the size was more like a small instead of a xl,0
5,These are really nice in person. They look much more expensive than they were. They are the perfect addition to my collection because they're simple and can be worn with so much.,1
2,the bracelet is amazing but the chain is very easy to break,0
2,I found it a little shorter on me than I had hoped it would fit.,0
3,They wete beautiful but to small lost one already send me coupon please,0
3,"The tote is small. Will fit a book and your lunch. The beautiful design is only on one side, I don't think I would have bought it if I knew that in advance. The quality is  good and its a sturdy bag. I don't think it can be washed in the washing machine the fabric on the back side is a velvet type texture.",0
2,"These are darker than the original lenses. It was easy to replace, though there's a film on these lenses and I can't seem to get them clean. That are constantly streaky looking and always have to wipe them. I'm not sure if this was worth the money or not. They fit well, but are always dirty looking.",0
2,"This bag is cute and the adjustable drop length is convenient, but there is NO WAY it is real leather. It has that fake-leather-chemical smell and doesn't feel anything like the real leather of another Isaac Mizrahi bag I ordered (even from the same seller though). Either I was sent a knock-off, or the &#34;leather&#34; description is incorrect.",0
2,I disliked  the leather buckle part I found it to be slightly excessive in size but other than that its fine .,0
1,Frayed and fell apart after one wash,0
3,Fit perfectly but only lasted about a month with the Velcro strap!,0
1,Not what I expected,0
5,"I love these earrings.  Perfect size, price and color.",1
3,I really would love to keep these but the sleeves are short and idk if they‚Äôll shrink.,0
5,S2 looks new again,1
5,Great tie!,1
5,Love these bags! They fit a lot of items and are convenient to carry. I also LOVE the dogs on the fabric üëçüèª,1
2,I can‚Äôt see through the plastic mask and it‚Äôs very hot!,0
2,"The material was coarse and the straps just didnt make sense up or down, despite the reviews. Im just under 5'3"" and I ordered up but they were snug on my thick thighs and the straps were super long. Not recommend for shorties...",0
5,The bag is sturdy yet thin enough to do it's job. The size is generous and can be adapted for many various uses. Easy to clean and re-use. Glad I purchased.,1
5,"Great surprise. These leg warmers are outstanding. Very long and can be pulled very high over large calf and knees, bought XL. They have some elastic in them that makes them very comfortable . Bought them for warmth would buy again.",1
3,Love the brown but this one is a lot smaller and feels uncomfortable. Also the material is a little thicker. Love the color. Will give to my daughter,0
5,Nice quality!,1
5,Really soft and super comfortable!!,1
1,Omg more like extra small.<br /> the medium was small so I order the large and it‚Äôs the same size as the medium<br />I returned them,0
5,Muy bueno,1
4,"I wore this skirt for family photos. It was hard to pull up but once I got it on it fit fine, then of course it was hard to take off again as well. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend it.",1
5,Bargain. Wife liked the blue color. She primarily wears silver jewelry and these came on time and were a great purchase.,1
4,Love the feel of these! They are so comfy and totally ‚Äúsquat proof‚Äù,1
5,Boyfriend loves it and he hasn't destroyed it yet so it must be the Batmans belt!,1
3,Too tight on my head.,0
5,I can always depend on Girbaud.,1
5,"I didn‚Äôt realize I hadn‚Äôt written a review for these pj pants until now. After a year, and then some, they still fit great. I haven‚Äôt had any problems with them falling apart or the fabric ‚Äúballing up‚Äù like soft pjs usually do! I love these!",1
3,Material is good. Just short in lenght nothing like the photo. Falls off shoulders.,0
5,Every child should have one.  My niece and nephew love them!,1
5,"Fits on Pandora like bracelets. My friend was born in Trinidad, raised in Canada and now here in the US. Perfect symbolism of where she began to where she is now and the unity we have as friends from differing countries.",1
5,Boy friend loved it. Got here quick,1
2,"Not easy on,or easy off.",0
3,"Color was off a bit. Padding where? If you're a small cup like me, order a size smaller. Bottoms were tight, not too tight. If you like a little cheeky, order as directed. I'll have work on this top but I'll still wear it",0
2,I'm very pear shaped.  Calves about 19 inches.  These were a struggle to get on and fell about 2 inches below the knee... and I have super short legs!  I did all I could to pull them to my knees but nope.<br /><br />Giving them to my daughter.,0
5,Very soft and nice fit,1
5,Love it,1
5,"I think this is adorable!! It is stylish as well. You have to be careful when adjusting it though, it is made alright. I can see how adjusting it over and over or roughly may break it. So, its a delicate piece.",1
5,"Fits my weekender watch, also nice that it came with tools",1
1,The Fit was sadly too small. Good luck and feel,0
3,"The shipping was faster than I expected. The legging looks cute, only one thing i dont like about this legging is the material is quite cheap. Overall, it's all good.",0
5,Super comfortable.  Fits great.,1
5,I love this swim suit so much! Great quality and fits perfect! I would buy again for sure!,1
5,Cute apron for the pig lover in your life.,1
3,"Sleeves are really long, but helps keep me warm during water aerobics!",0
5,"THis product arrived promptly and not only included 2 sets of pins, but also the tool for pin insertion.  It fits my wat h perfectly and after 5 weeks appears to have the same durability.  The only thing missing is the Luminox logo, which does not seem to bother the deer while I am sitting in the deer blind.....",1
4,Fits great except it‚Äôs a bit slim at the knees - nice style and durable so far (used for 5+hrs worth of rides). Lots of zip pockets!,1
3,I was really excited for this dress because it looked so cute! And it was! this dress is ADORABLE..... on my ten year-old Sister. It was waaaay too small which is a pity.,0
1,veryyy cheap material that hugs your body all wrong,0
5,"The pants are comfortable, especially in the summer. Dungarees are to heavy and they don‚Äôt breathe. The cotton material is much better! Bought 3 pants, well worth the purchase!",1
5,"I had the opportunity to grab this ZIMAOSHAN Women's Short Sleeve V-Neck Shirt for my wife - she really likes it. The color is very nice, it has a great shape fitting to her, and the material feels very nice. She does really like this shirt. That said, she says she feels it runs a bit small. In fact, she got it a size up and it just fits at that size - so her recommendation is to size one up. Overall this is a nice shirt and she is happy to have it, planning to wear it for days out - more in formal - or for working out. It looks good on her, so I‚Äôm happy with the choice, but again, keep in mind the sizing.",1
5,Nice,1
2,Color was too light (almost white). Thieves are plainly visible when I wear them and I'm extremely pale person who gets next to no sun.,0
5,Beautiful.  I am enjoying using it.,1
3,Fairly good quality but the arms are very small. Size up once or twice. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 195. Bought an XL and couldn‚Äôt get it over my head.,0
3,Very pretty.. but too heavy kind of uncomfortable,0
2,Nice Bag an exact replica of Michael Kors version<br />but took small for my needs,0
5,Bought them as a gift for my niece. She has not taken them off since.,1
2,"Looks good.<br /><br />But the teeth inside the back of the buckle do. Ot hold onto the end of the belt fabric. When I hang items off my belt for work, the interior end of the belt keeps sliding loose and then comes completely out, dumping my items all over the place.<br /><br />I may be able to sharpen the teeth kn the back part of the buckle, but I shouldn't have to. This is frustrating.",0
3,"Material is not as expected, Fit was good.",0
2,It's a sweater dress so I expected it to be more substantial than it is. Very thin fabric.,0
2,It would have been perfect except for that scratch right in the middle of the print. I tried to look past it but I can‚Äôt.,0
5,"Fits well and the fabric is very soft! Other leotards I've purchased from amazon were cut weird, sewn poorly, and didn't fit as expected. I'll be buying from Lizartards from now on.",1
5,Love it! Exactly what I wanted!,1
5,GREAT hoodie. Warm and comfy. 5T fits my 4yr old great - not too small but space to grow. You can see through the 'mesh eyes but mostly that part just sits on top of the head comfortably and just pull it lower for pretending :) this is doubling up as her Halloween costume :),1
5,"It's comfortable and it looks great. I couldn't be happier with it, they only thing is that I'm 5'9"" 160 lbs so I bought a 2xl which fine but I prefer a shirts looser so I recommend going bigger",1
5,Beautiful bracelet. Even better than I could've possibly expected. Pictures here really don't do it justice. Good gift for my niece.,1
3,Wore three times and a grommet fell off already,0

1,"That‚Äôs what I get for paying for something that looks nice for super cheap. Hooked it on, loosely at that, and still with one turn of the neck it broke. Like come on just make sturdy jewelry don‚Äôt just sell it just to sell it!",0
1,Total ripoff. Not compatible with Charge 4. Amazon should be ashamed for selling this.,0
3,The skirt is fine but the top is too big.,0
5,"So far the case has held up well. The magnets which allow for closing the case are strong enough to the point that I don't worry about separation. The case is a tad bulky, but I could tell before buying it. The bulkiness allows me to store related items in the case as well, although I keep the glasses in a pouch when doing so. I have been planning on another pair of Gunnar glasses in the future and this case would likely hold both pairs.",1
5,"Price is great for this adjustable sax neck strap.<br />You can use it on Alto, Tenor and Baritone horns.<br />Pretty comfortable.",1
4,Very comfortable,1
5,I absolutely love this maxi dress! I posted pics of all my news summer dresses I ordered from Amazon and everyone was asking for the links and where I got them! It fit perfect too. I went off the size chart and didn't have any problems with fit. I'll definitely be buying more maxi's off Amazon because I can't find ones as nice in any of my local stores for such an amazing price!!!,1
5,Super soft tee. In Love!!. I bought it for the color not really knowing thr saying in it. Lol<br />Great color!! Light weight but not see through and pretty stretchy,1
3,"Although the description says it fits an iphone 6Plus, it doesn't. The iphone slides in, but you cannot snap the closure.",0
1,Wasn‚Äôt what I expected.,0
5,"Very cute bag, exactly what I was looking for.  Quick shipping.",1
1,Way to small,0
5,Gift,1
5,"I like it. Love the long sleeve. Not a see through, but recommend full slip under it.",1
5,"Really thick and keeps warm. More of a straight fall, not really gathered at waist. Have received many compliments on it.",1
3,a little too tight to fix on tie without a good deal of effort,0
5,Purchased for grand daughter's birthday. She absolutely loves them.,1
5,Excellent,1
5,Fit fine! Great for party favors.,1

3,"Firstly, I would like to say that I had a great deal of trouble dealing with this company. I ordered this item on May 22nd and was told I would receive it by June 3rd at the latest. It was almost June 3rd by the time I received a notice saying the necklace was not in stock, even though it was labeled In Stock on the page when I purchased it. I was given the option to take a refund or to wait a week and have it shipped out. Being that I felt so strongly about this necklace, I chose to wait the week. Time passed, and by June 12th I still hadn't heard anything as to the status of my order. I wrote the company and waited for a response. When I finally got one, I wasn't very pleased with the helpfulness or civility factors, and they still were not very informative. It was only later when I saw an email stating my order had finally shipped that I got any information about it. The entire next week I tried to track my shipment with no success. It arrived today, June 20th - 17 days later than promised. For this reason I will never do business with this company again. That being said, the swan pendant itself is very nice. The first thing to keep in mind is that, if you're looking for something somewhat substantial, this really isn't it. The height of the swan is only about two pinky tip widths, which is okay, but I did think it would be a bit bigger. Also, while I realize the diamond accents would have to be extremely small, they don't look the same as in the picture - the wing might as well just be bumpy sterling silver, as there is no sparkle, and the bumps between the diamond accents are far more noticeable than the accents. Overall a very nice necklace that I am sure to enjoy, but I was beyond turned off by the company's demeanor and will never be shopping with them again.",0
3,"I bought these shoes for my daughter. I bought a size larger than what she was wearing, thinking that the children‚Äôs feet will grow faster, so I bought a larger size, so she can wear them for a long time. But When I got them, my daughter tried it on and the shoes were just right. So the pair of shoes, my daughter didn‚Äôt wear them for a long time, and they were not suitable, What a pity!",0
5,23,1
4,Very cute I just wish it was in the size for infants.  I have a 3 year old and this is too small for her and a 4 month old and it is too big for her.  I think this is for a size 18- 24 month old.  It is really cute...the material is soft and smooth and the construction of this item is well stitched together.  I love the very soft feel of this item...it feels like silken cotton...and it's reversible...On the reverse side there is no ears at the hood....I am going to give this as a gift to a set of twins who wear  a 24 month and are tall for their age<br />I would recommend this item to family and friends<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for a honest review.,1
1,"After waiting for 4 of these shirts, they finally came after 2 months of waiting.  I washed them and dried them and they have permanent wrinkles in the.  I washed them again hoping the wrinkles would come out, but they did not.  I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase these tops.  I doubt I would ever get a refund since it took 2 months to receive these.",0
4,Hi everyone ! I‚Äôll first tell you my weight and height I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and weight 110 . I ordered a small and it fit perfect . I have a very very small waist . If your waist is not that small then size up . Hope you guys love them .,1
3,I do like the color but the face of the watch is way too big for my liking. I am returning it for this reason,0
2,Very cheap fabric and super wrinkled.,0
1,No noise piece,0
1,This is the cheapest cap I have ever seen if the material was any thinner you could see through it very flimsy DISAPPOINTED,0
2,"The ""marsala"" color is completely different from the advertised picture. It's orangey colored.",0
1,Visor it ok but  What I received it does not what it showed on the picture.,0
1,Sizing is a JOKE. With these &#34;Asian&#34; sizes things run small but good grief. I wear an XL but ordered the 3XL & it fits like a medium. Just RIDICULOUS.  This is SUPPOSED to be a loose fit shirt so should of had PLENTY room. On the plus side material was nice & summery & it was a true navy blue. So disappointed.,0
5,"Great fit, comfortable and looks god peeking from a low cut jacket.",1
5,"Great quality, I ordered 2 sizes up and fits big on top part, will return for a smaller size, overall lovely dress. After ordering 2 different sizes dress still fit lose on top part and had to return. Still a beautiful dress however it will not fit someone with a small chest.",1
1,Oily cheap fabric bigtime,0
1,Shirt fit ok but neck was very big.,0
5,So cute,1
2,"I'm 5'8, athletic build, ordered a small and it fit like a medium/large. Returned.<br /><br />Material is soft and comfy but also kinda cheap looking.",0
5,Fit too small,1
5,"Beautiful dress, fits just right.",1
5,So thankful for this technology.  Wish the price was cheaper.,1
5,Love the dress.. very flattering.,1
2,"These fit well and look just like the pictures, however, the package that I received had been worn and washed. They smelled of old body odor.",0
5,Very nice quality.,1
3,"This is the second one I have bought, warning it shrinks when washed. Super cute cover up thought I'd buy another one and a little bit larger size but it's still shrimp to I even used woolite so it wouldn't shrink but it does didn't even dry it hung it up to dry and it's still shrunk.",0
5,Nice large watch with automatic movement. Standard or better seiko quality and keeps time well. Has a clockwise bezel lock out but that‚Äôs fine. So far so good for daily wear or vacation watch. Like this spin off of Tuna very much.,1
1,"i like the fabric but the block pattern makes your shoulders look weird.<br />also, dealing with the seller regarding returns is not easy as they are out of country.",0
3,"My daughter loves these, but they are a little expensive for what you get",0
3,They are fully waterproof and were comfortable out of the box. They need to be worn with heavy socks as they are roomy. The tongue could be about 1 inch longer so tie knot is on the tongue not above it.,0
5,Nice,1
5,"Love, I'm a 38B, fit good. Very comfortable, pads stay in place. These are the best. Purchased in multiple colors",1
5,very cute and good quality!,1
1,Fell apart,0
3,Its thin enough you to wear under your bicycle helmet.<br /><br />I hand washed these soon as i got it. it took me 'wash with soap and rinse' x 15 times until black ink color didn't come out.<br />DO NOT wash with other clothing if you are going to put it in the washer. you will have purple look on your bright color clothes.,0
1,Sized WAY TOO SMALL! I wear a very standard US Large. The label says Made in China XXL and runs VERY SMALL!,0
5,This is a perfect gift! Love the pattern and the fact it comes with its own little bag to store it in when not in use.,1
1,Runs small - but great for Halloween,0
1,Not for small kids. Maybe an 8 9 or preteen. I wanted for toddlers. They do not fit. Not small enough,0
4,Fits very comfortable. Cute and stylish shirt. I like the airy material keeping me cool and how it fits on my body.,1
3,Not sure what all the hype is about.. these leggings suck.<br /><br />No tummy control.<br />They do not pass the squat test.<br />They do not stay put (even when walking around the house).<br /><br />The end.,0
5,Love the style.,1
2,good for one time use.,0
3,Very cute. But very small. About 2 sizes smaller than what they should have been,0
2,"This looked nice, but not functional. Here's what went wrong: torn on arrival, threading that is sewing wood pieces to paper is all undone, handle is awkward shape for parasol holding, and there is no hole in handle for a ribbon/string handle. It would be fine as decoration, but not as a functional parasol.",0
3,The cut out was to small for my badge. I‚Äôm still using it though and works fine,0
4,"The only downside is that the beads get caught in the mesh and snags. Otherwise, great dress.",1
1,My white band broke within 3 days. I am very disappointed,0
5,Bought this pack as a gifts for my daughter‚Äôs friends...everyone LOVED them!  The yellow checkerboard,1
2,Washed for first time: cold water low dry temp. Shirt lost its sheen and collar was stiff and did not want to fold properly. I expected more from this shirt that was so beautiful coming out of the package.,0
5,Perfect no shoe for flat shoes. They barely peek out the top but the lace makes them super cute and dainty.,1
5,"Great product, great price. I've received many compliments.",1
3,too cute but way too small for my needs.,0
1,"the amount of feathers flying around my house was offensive. this thing is just a graduation gown with cheap feathers from a child's boa glued on. When I asked to return it, the seller didn't even want it back. You know that is a great sign about how they feel about their product.",0
5,Absolutely love this watch! Simple and elegant. The gold trimming is very complimentary.,1
5,"This came quickly and was exactly what I wanted. It is a smaller buckle but that is the style I like to wear. I have similar ones for carpentry, etc and this compliments my collection. Well made too.",1
5,"Exactly as described. Stretchy elastic, easily fit over my large hand. I get lots of complements about it. Essential oils last a fairly long time.",1
3,Was tooo big even for me and I'm the big sister.<br />Material is cheap and doesnt come with an adjustment in size.,0
2,I stilk git static and then already not working,0
5,Absolutely perfect! Fits true to size.,1
5,"Nice hat,came fast and will buy again",1
1,Did not look like shirt advertised. Thought it was going to be more transparent. Disappointed.,0
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,1
2,These were ok but way to small... These are for people with little heads,0
5,"Love, Love, Love!! If offered in different color, will purchase!",1
5,So comfortable and pretty. I hope that it will wash well.,1
2,The length was not there at all. Literally cropiest of crop tops,0
1,"Came in, the light never worked. super dissapointed. üòï",0
4,"I really like my grid-it for organizing things, and it's definitely really good quality - but it's also heavy for it's size - it'd be even better if it were more light-weight",1
2,The material is crap. Feels like it‚Äôs made out of Halloween costume.,0
1,In order to get the band to fit on my smartwatch I would have had to force it into the bracket space & it would have scraped the inside area.  The tool for adjusting the sizing of the band was so weak that it bent before I could release the lock on the clasp to adjust the fit.  Sending it back immediately.,0
4,"Ok, they weren't as nice as the originals but do the job for the price.  I didn't want to pay a tremendous amount for a piece of plastic.  For the price this is a good buy.",1
5,"I have used these for years and now have my daughter and friends hooked on them too.  Great for when you don't want to carry a purse but need your ID, credit cards and small amount of cash.  Just slip into your  pocket and go. Being a metal case, nothing inside gets damaged.",1
5,The shorts fit perfectly and the material is of high quality. They‚Äôre so comfortable too.,1
2,"Beautiful, but too small",0
1,Poor quality (trash),0
3,Only gave it three stars because the matieral is Silky. My husband calls it my ‚ÄúChinese Shirt.‚Äù Because of the fabric. The patterns & colors are true to the photo. The stripes are black & white with the floral being Navy blue. If Black & Navy Blue patterns bother you or the silk matieral look I wouldn‚Äôt buy it.,0
2,I'm a pretty skinny guy with narrow feet and these are way too narrow. My wife and friend laughed when they saw me put them on.,0
3,"Great quality but yet another ring that is supposed to be a 2g comes in as a 4g. keeping it  because it has a smaller diameter that might be helpful in some situations, but I guess I just need to go to an actual store to find a 2g as online shopping gas not been successful.",0
2,"Super disappointed with this item. It fit well across shoulders and the sleeve length was perfect. However, the overall length of the garment was ridiculously short. Nothing like the length shown in the picture. I wish I had read the reviews before ordering as this appears to be an issue across the board.",0
3,Cute dress. Its t-shirt material and very stretchy. Nothing fancy but comfortable to wear.  I ordered xl and fits great.,0
4,"This shirt is nice and comfortable. It's thick enough that it's not see through, but thin enough to still wear during the warmer seasons. The length is great. It goes perfect with some leggings.",1
2,"Too small around waist, but large up top. I sent it back for a refund. I was disappointed because it is a pretty blouse.",0
5,"These are great, comfortable and warm slippers!  No fake sherling here!  Its the real deal!",1
3,"See through, needs lining.",0
4,Fit ok. I fpund one i liked better,1
4,Fits nicely and is comfortable to lounge around the house in.,1
5,Arrived on time and is as described!,1
5,Great socks! My plantar fasciitis is under control thanks to these socks.  I wear them when exercising to avoid agitating my feet condition and help.support them.  They are really comfortable to walk in and the perfect length.,1
2,"Horrible product. Quality was very poor, has no support or shape.",0
2,Very cheaply made looks like it was made out of a plastic bag! I was very disappointed!,0
3,it's a birthday for a 13 year haven't given it yet so can't rate it yet. So once I give the gift will make a review,0
5,Cute dress with an adorable pattern that can be dressed up or down. The quality of the fabric exceeded my expectations and feels like a more expensive dress than it was! I‚Äôm generally a size medium and ordered a medium and it fit Perfectly. If you‚Äôre in between sizes order down as the dress does allow for some wiggle room. Would order again!!,1
5,"Pain in the hiney to install, but it's perfect for my Gear 2. Although, the straps were waayy too long and I had to trim them with scissors.",1
3,Purchased for a 12 year old. Quality was very cheap.,0
4,"While I think this is a cute sweater for V-day, the picture is not accurate. The heart is bright pink and not red at all. I wear a size 6-8 in tops and the medium was a little big on me, but I wanted it a little loose so I could wear something under it or just have it baggy.",1
5,"Well made, sturdy zipper, wide cuffs, warm but wish it was bigger around the bottom.",1
5,Peace of mind! Totally recommend!!,1
5,Love them. They compliment my professional and dress-up look.,1
4,Nice for the price. I just found my son and husband never use it.,1
1,No way is this 'above the waist' .... barely comes up to waist and then constantly pulls down ... I'm forever yanking them up.  None of my other yoga pants are like this ... would not recommend these for anything.,0
5,"Purchased some new sunglasses on a trip out East this last summer and wanted to protect them from getting scratched up.  Yes, 2 pairs! Keeping them nice.... and I purchased a cover, the black one for my husband, who is notorious for scratching up his lenses.  It's working he's keeping them in the case when not in use!",1
5,"I have now purchased three of these. I absolutely love them. I am 5'10 and they are long, with a very flattering cut. They flow nicely and are heavy enough to work as a maxi dress going out, or simply wear it around the house.",1
4,"Texture is soft but sturdy and there's plenty of room to toss big things like water bottles into it without even taking it off your shoulder. However, each strap is made of two strips so it can be unwieldy and difficult to grab all four strips at once and then keep all that material in place on your shoulder. The most frustrating feature is that with the extra straps and the way the bag is shaped at the top it can be an ordeal to hold it open to get a good look at what's in the bag. Still like it overall despite the bit of frustration.",1
2,I just got some old shoes I wanted to clean I used this cleaner never cleaned shoes really ever in my life it cleaned them up but as for like major stains or anything siting for a long time this cleaner will NOT get it out I‚Äôve been scrubbing and nothing it keep yours shoes clean enough but if u actully want to clean them I think I need a stronger brush or a better cleaner,0
5,Look and for great i hope they hold up in the wash,1
3,Cute- but looked better on the model in the pictureüòù,0
4,Look good,1
1,Fell apart after a few wears,0
5,Fit perfectly for my boyfriend and very food quality!,1
5,Great shirt ---washes good (I turn inside out)  fit as expected---son loves it !!,1
1,It‚Äôs not very flattering  and I didn‚Äôt like the  material,0
5,My wife loved all the items,1
3,Nice pajamas but the bottoms were way small.  Disappointed.,0
1,Cheap and will last 3 days max,0
3,The size is not for full fit...the legs are not long enough,0
2,Nice and good quality but it looks like a bathrobe on. Returning it unfortunately,0
2,material fine. Clasp keeps coming undone.,0
5,Love these boots.  I always buy one size larger with boots.  They are a perfect fit and I like the soft sparkles.,1
5,My fianc√© loves it,1
5,Good fit!,1
2,I was hoping for something better since so many of the reviews were pretty good.  The color of the tutu didn‚Äôt match the leotard.  Perhaps this is just the case with the ballet pink?  The tutu doesn‚Äôt seem to be sewn on securely enough for an actual toddler to wear regularly to dance class.  This would likely be better for a Halloween costume with less use.  This is a very cheap outfit so for the price I believe you get what you pay for.,0
5,"I bought this for my Harry Potter loving son who adores it! The scarf is great quality, very thick and soft.",1
1,Just didn‚Äôt fill any of my expectations but kept because it costs more to send back than keep.  Probably won‚Äôt order clothes from amazon in the future.,0
5,"I wear a 14, I got a LARGE PLUS",1
5,What a nice watch.. Highly  Recommended,1
4,"It fits nicely, the length is as described, the color is a bit more faded than I expected but still looks good. It is a casual look but, because of the color (burgundy), it can be dressed up with a necklace.",1
3,The shirt was a bit bulky and not flattering for my figure.,0
5,Excellent Buy Great Seller.,1
5,Pleasantly surprised by how well this dress fits. It's good length and true to size. The purple color is gorgeous.,1
5,like,1
1,"pretty, plan on reusing the beads and hardware.",0
5,Awesome üëç,1
1,Size runs wayyy to small,0
3,It was perfect when I wore it then I was not able to wear it anymore after the first wash even if it was on Cold. So I am reamly disappointed.,0
5,Love my new coat! It is perfect for fall days. It fits as expected!,1
1,"It's very short, almost a crop top. The size is way small. I washed it once and now my 8-year old doesn't even fit into it. Waste of money.",0
5,"Sees like an excellent product. I've only worn the yoga socks once but they are soft and supple, have plenty of traction on the bottom, and came through a first washing very well.",1
1, ,0
1,"Glasses were what I expected for the price. I also expected the long shipping time, as described. The dealbreaker for me was the intense, pungent smell of cigarette smoke that permeated the case and the glasses themselves. I could not wear them because of the smell. Returned.",0
3,"The cups fit a little on the small side and a little oddly, most of the support coming from the top, where they are sewn into the suit. It looks nice but probably could size up for a more comfortable fit or grt your exact size and adjust every so often to keep everything where it should be.",0
4,Worth every dime<br />I would recommend and buy again,1
3,"Very pretty well made dress! I sure wish it was t made for giraffes! I am 5'4 and 1/2 and 180, busty (42dd), all stomach, and thus dress goes well past my knees and because of the way it's made with the irregular hem I'm having a hard time finding a tailor who knows how to shorten it. So, although it is lovely, and the blue is striking, it is of no use to me. Sigh. Wish Amazon had more petite length dresses.",0
1,They came ripped.,0
5,Love these! I ordered them and have been wearing them for about 2-3 weeks. They are very pretty! Comfortable to wear and the perfect size!,1
5,So cute! Showed up quickly and in great shape. Mine actually came with 4 snaps for more size options than shown in the picture (which I think is great if you have a smaller neck).,1
2,The cap is very tiny and be lost fast! Sometimes the ball feels like it will go through my earring hole.,0
3,"I ordered 2 sizes up hoping for a very loose fitting top to wear out into public. The color is gorgeous and you can tell it's fitted very nicely. Unfortunately a 2x fit as a large and it's not what I was hoping for. I'm 5'2 and weigh 200lb if that gives you a better idea, it is a thicker fabric than most athletic tops I've purchased in the past. I recommend going up at least one size if you don't want the top hugging all of your tummy rolls and showing them off.",0
3,The shoe did not at all fit my daughter.,0
3,Dint like it that much,0
2,I bought the labradorite bracelet and only 6 out of the 16 stones even had a flash of color. I was happy with the size and how fast it was delivered. I wanted it to last a long time but it broke after I tried to take It off.,0
4,Happy,1
5,love them,1
5,Nice watch it is better than expected,1
5,"Didn't put much effort into researching or reading reviews on this product. Purchased them randomly but I'm satisfied with the purchase, material and fit is nice, pictures are accurate.",1
5,These work great and you can't beat the price. I love how they fit and they will last forever. I would definitely purchase again!,1
1,"Water goes into it, warranty is a joke, you have to pay the shipping, that is likely more than the watch cost. Casio used to be a good brand, not anymore.",0
5,My daughter loved the set!,1
3,The hat looks better in the pictures than it is in real life. It still works just the colors are slightly off.,0
2,Only buy if you are short,0
3,They are ok. For some reason my skin doesn't like the metal so my skin it's irritated.,0
4,Great fit. Looks like the picture. Comfy. Nice business casual shirt. The hubs usually wears tees to work but during meetings with clients he throws on a button-down shirt over that. This one worked out perfectly for his use.,1
5,As advertised,1
5,This was very posh and well made. It surprised me.,1
4,purse was a gift for Christmas.  The only thing I don't like is that there was no invoice enclosed.,1
1,This tie and pocket square does not have the crisp look that I am accustom to and was way too shiny.,0
5,Good item a little thinner than I thought but ok.,1
5,This top is soo beautiful and comfortable. I'm getting ready to order more.,1
5,My cat chewed up the original band to my speidel pulsometer watch. These replacement bands were extremely easy to put on and work perfectly. I'm super happy I didn't have to replace the entire (expensive) watch.<br /><br />Please mark if my review was helpful.,1
5,"The price is right, and so is the fit!  Got this color on sale.  Comfortable and modest enough to wear around the condo pool.",1
5,I am an Amazon Queen. First time I have bought diamonds. I am so happy with my purchase. The 2 carat diamond earrings are stunning. The price is very reasonable. Don't hesitate to buy from Houston District. I had several questions & they were very helpful. I have a pair of 1 carat diamond earrings & wanted the setting to match the 2 carat. They were so helpful. So I sent them my 1 carat earrings they set them in the matching setting & only charged me $150. So I wear the 2 carat in my first pierced ear & the 1 carat in the my second pierced hole. So LOVE them!!! BEAUTIFUL.  Buy from Houston District Diamond Trust me You will not be dissappointed.,1
3,The material was thicker than expected.  Def too hot for Dubai...where it was 104!,0
2,"This is the kind of product you could never sell in a real store. Anyone trying these gloves on would put them back. I returned them immediately--out $2.45 in return shipping cost. I gave 2 instead of 1 star because I don't like to be extreme. Yet, these are clearly x-small. I have extra small hands -- 6.5&#34; in diameter, measured at the knuckles, glove size 6. The glove was way too tight at the seams of the fingerlings, definitely child-size. But in the palm area, the glove was roughly a medium. I wish I'd taken a pic before returning them to show that the shape of the gloves is wrong, in other words, no one has hands shaped like that. I would say definitely do not buy. No matter what your size, they won't properly fit any human hand.<br /><br />Also, the material is very thin. A little stretchy, but seams around the fingers, though stretchy, are very tight and will feel like your circulation is being pinched off. The stitching is of good quality.<br /><br />Here are some other gloves that feel wonderful. [[ASIN:B005PFNSXG Arthritis Gloves Medium]] My husband bought them for himself. I don't have arthritis, so I don't need the compression and therefore wear the same size he does--medium--even though his hands are mens medium.",0
5,Cute gloves and warm,1
2,Cheap straps,0
3,Great design but very small. I bought it for a comfortable pajama/around the house shirt but it‚Äôs tight. The women‚Äôs large looks more like a children‚Äôs large,0
1,Very very tiny- much smaller than pictured!!! Will be returning!!!!!,0
5,Just what I was looking for to wear with a military themed costume. The perfect size for the shoulders without looking too big or the fringe being too long.,1
3,"The gems are nice and the right size but the shaft is too long for ears, unless you have really fat ears. And they seems to be 18g which makes the threads on the head too small for my 16g posts.",0
5,Loving it,1
5,Great for reading outdoors.  No glare.,1
3,It is nice and pretty I only gave 3 stars cause I suppose of got it on the 17th but I got it on the 26th.,0
3,Shirt fits baggy but still cute. Need to offer an XS.,0
1,Should have known it was too good to be true!! My grandson ordered this and didn‚Äôt read the reviews and what we received was a sweatshirt that could be sold at a dollar store!!,0
2,It does not fit a small woman's wrist.  I will donate mine to our local Assistant League and hope it works for someone.,0
5,These are very comfortable to wear even with shoes. I got them originally for yoga but find them a bit slippery. I'll wear around the house and later when it gets colder.,1
5,I like this shirt because it is cute and soft.  I would recommend this to anyone.,1
5,"First and foremost, the packaging was everything! Beautifully done.  It comes with a gift bag and tissue for gifting.  The necklace is beautiful too, but it was the unpackaging for me.",1
1,Too cheap,0
5,"It‚Äôs beautiful but if you are small-medium<br />It‚Äôs to big! I loved and I gave it to my niece, I‚Äôm small..she‚Äôs taller and and weighs more than me",1
3,"We bought these ""Size 18-month"" shorts for our 19 month old son.  The quality and comfort are good.  The sizing is WAY too big.  They hang down nearly to his ankles but are big and baggy.  An odd look.",0
3,"The helmet looks amazing there were small discrepancy like the glue being visible in the visor, the paint job could a have used another layer and the delay time to received the item without notification of when it will arrive.",0
5,Awesome hat. Very vivid colors on the lettering. I receive many compliments.,1
3,Bought as a gift for my husband. I think it‚Äôs cute but he didn‚Äôt wear them,0
5,This is the best looking and fitting Gator hat I've ever had! My head has some size to it (all the smarts) so I ordered the L/XL and it feels damn good!! GO GATORS!!!,1
5,Great costume.  Exactly what we expected; tail is really cute.,1
5,"With winter still here but us just starting FB this allowed them to play, stay warm and have a built in mask!",1
1,This product claims to be hypoallergenic and nickel free and it is not. I've worn plenty of jewelry with the same claim and they all were totally fine and worked very well. This specific jewelry made my ear swell and become infected even. its pretty though,0
3,i enjoy the color selection and the good quality but they are on the large side.<br />my mom is a size 7 and im a size 11/12 and we spend a lot of time pulling them up<br />because of the free size which makes this purchase not a good fit.,0
4,"Ordered an XL, I am 5'3 170, it is longer than I expected other than that a very cute dress, can't wait to wear it. The extra long is loose probably could have ordered a large but I'll keep it",1
1,Poor quality,0
4,"Although this is a very soft well made sports bra, it has very little stretch to get on. I normally wear a large sports bra and even the 2x was tight. Kinda a bummer",1
1,Doesn't fit the way it looks. Front closure gaps.,0
1,"Wish I would have returned this, but it looked nice enough. However it quickly deteriorated based on how the clips to attatch it got be watch face were designed. Eventually I caught it on something small and the clip itself bent. Maybe I could have repaired it, but the band was already ripped so I threw it away. Maybe three weeks of wear totally. Took it off when washing my hands, washing dishes, and even when it rained.",0
5,"Cute little pins, I believe they are about the size pictured",1
5,can't wait to give this ring to my mom for Christmas..,1
3,ok but very thin,0
5,"These boxers are made from quality material. However, the sizing is similar to that of basketball shorts. I am a US size 34 so these fit my waist comfortably on the loose size, so you should be good if you are a US size 36 as well. Also, I am 6'2&#34; and the boxer shorts extend past my knees, so they are longer than your typical boxers. However, the product is very comfortable and I prefer it to regular boxers. Also, I have to disclaim that I received these at a discount for my honest review.",1
3,Cute,0
2,I ordered this belt in brown and black. The description claims full grain leather but the belt is actually just genuine leather which is much lower quality. I would give it a 1 star review for false advertising and return it but it is still a pretty good belt for the price.,0
5,Perfect for my tween granddaughter,1
5,Love the material and it fits perfect,1
5,"Comfy, fits well, super cute",1
1,Thin and cheap fabric used for the dress. The sleeves are extremely long and the elastics that should be able to hold them around the wrists are too big. There are no tags on the dresses to tell size and the sowed in tag in the back has been cut with scissors.,0
5,Great band!,1
5,Perfect with very good detail on it.,1
3,"If your looking for a fitted polo, this is not it. Its a very boxy fit shirt. The quality of the fabric is good. A thicker cotton blend. Mostly cotton. This is not a Junior fit. I'm a Women's M and it fit like a larger Womens M. I had to take in the sides about 3 inch total and its slightly fitted. A little more feminine look to it.",0
1,"Do not buy, really poor quality with a cloth like sole that I wouldn‚Äôt use outdoors.",0
4,"It's a great watch. The product arrived on time and, the watch keeps good time. The watch face is a little smaller than I expected, but it still fits well around my wrist. I'm showing it off with my other watches in a display box. I would definitely order from them again.",1
5,"Very cute, holding sturdy, seems to hold up well to 4 year old playground play. Would recommend.",1
1,The material is weird it's not a cotton sweatshirt would definitely not buy again,0
5,This tie reminds me of the superb design of Brioni and Yves St. Laurent.<br />It has a French-Italien style.<br />You will love it.,1
1,Sherpa is not youth sizing. vendor cannot get size right. Returned order and reorder.,0
1,Not happy with this buy,0
1,didn't even send product--sent rayban sunglasses from China.,0
1,Two separate necklaces. Both broke within an hour of me wearing it. The cord on the moon literally snapped in half in the center. The cord in the gen came out of the snap fixture. Don't waste your money.,0
3,It looks very cheap but it's still nice to have.  The moon stone is not the actual crystal moonstone you find in occult shops though.,0
3,"So, the pants were too tightly squeezing at the waist line and the top was too loose & in turn unflattering for either article. It's too bad bc it's a cute fit, and I've got a fairly standard body type and size.",0
1,"First off, it took so long to receive this, I forgot I even ordered it. I ordered small since it‚Äôs the smallest it comes in. This is very obviously a women‚Äôs shirt, so I assumed it would be a ladies‚Äô fit. It must be men‚Äôs sizing because this small is huge. It won‚Äôt shrink because it‚Äôs some funky polyester looking material. This shirt is completely horrible.",0
5,"I love the earrings.  The only thing I don't like is they were pictured darker, more vintage looking but instead they are shiny gold.  But I will certainly be wearing them!",1
4,It‚Äôs good.,1
1,I wrote and told you that it had a hole beside the elastic.,0
2,A little big I had to bend it to make it fit and was scared it was going to snap in half.,0
4,as title.,1
3,fell apart after one week,0
3,"Meh, you get what you pay for. This purse looks cheap and smells strongly of plastic. It does have a super vibrant color. I got the green and the color is really nice. I‚Äôll use it a few times and then probably donate it to goodwill. It‚Äôs not one that I‚Äôll keep and reuse over and over.",0
5,Love them! One of the best socks I've ever worn for a 12 hour shift!!,1
3,"These sandals are a copy of the original style‚Ä¶look similar‚Äîsole is hard, does not bend‚Äîtoe loop wide. Good for slippers.",0
3,The onesie fit my 6 month old perfect but the skirt could fit my 2 year old.,0
1,Is cheap and looks it!,0
1,Bought two.  Cheap fabric.  Defective zipper.,0
3,These are very cheap material and tight on an average size head,0
5,Lindo,1
4,gift,1
5,Very nice sweatshirt. They do run a little small,1
5,"My great-grandson loves these boots!  Great price, great look, and a perfect fit.  I bought a pair<br />for his school,  a pair to keep at his house and now I am going to order him a pair to keep at<br />my house.  Oh yeah and a great selection.",1
1,Didn‚Äôt like the material at all it looks cheap,0
3,"Cute earrings, but ghe ones I received were black and whit, not black and black.",0
5,[[VIDEOID:cfa14fe90137d5a6d57a6a903a053df0]] Loved the outfit! Both front and back have the design.,1
3,It was inexpensive so I purchased it to try it out.  It seems okay but the color isn't as brown as I had hoped or what it looked like online.  I probably won't wear it unless I purchase something that would match this color.,0
5,Great quality and it actually fit my son.,1
5,Beautiful!!!!!!!!!,1
2,Beautiful polished stones! Took out of the package and placed it on my child's wrist and the bracelet snapped and released all the stones.  Disappointed,0
3,Some detail was lost..in the design..,0
5,Very nice arrived in a short time,1
5,Very nice watch band.  Thick but comfortable.  Would buy it again.,1
5,"I have been using shoe horns for decades, and this is the best one that I have ever used. It is contoured perfectly to make putting on your shoes as easy as possible. It is very sturdy and seems like it will never break or bend out of shape. As a bonus, it is even attractive to look at. I highly recommend this shoe horn.",1
5,"I love it. It's a good quality material. Just be sure to wash it by itself in the beginning due to possible color spreading. I put something in my wash thought to help my dark colors stay vibrant and to not leak. My only tiny complaint is that the patches are not on the elbows but on the side of the arm. When I bend my elbow, the patches almost look like they are in the front and I am certain I am not wearing the sweatshirt backwards. It's so darn cute though, that I don't really care. I am 5&#34;4 and 140 lbs. I ordered a large and it fits just like I wanted it to....not tight.",1
1,"Larger than expected but so much easier to read,",0
5,THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL RING...  THE PICTURE DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE.,1
4,Thank you for my refund.,1
5,Love the fullness it gives my girls' dresses.,1
2,"Not made of wood. Cheap stuff, I don't recommend, especially the shipping takes forever.",0
3,Well made slipper. Order up a size,0
1,The dress was too short and too big everywhere else.,0
2,came dirty and when i tried washing it nothing came off,0
1,"terrible quality, filmsy.",0
5,Material is great!,1
5,"I am 6 feet and I have always had trouble finding great yoga pants. I just got these today and absolutely love the feel of these pants, love how long they are and the emoticon at the bottom just makes them so cool to wear. I absolutely love the advice I read from one of the customers who suggested to buy a size up - glad I did because I am a medium and the large fits just right, the medium would have been too tight. I am ordering some more as soon as I complete this review yippie!!!!",1
1,Looks like toys,0
3,"It was an alright shirt, the sewing/threading was pretty cheap and the front is too short.",0
5,These are awesome! They fit my 10 year old perfect. They wash and dry without any problems.,1
3,"I got the &#34;plum&#34; color and the dye bled into other clothes in the wash, even in cold water. I then washed it in hot water with a white T-shirt and now have a lovely pastel-pink T, so I can't complain too much :P<br /><br />Also to note, the second button is further down than I'd expect (and prefer), and the collar naturally spreads out, meaning my chest (or undershirt) is largely exposed.",0
1,"This cutter looks like a very high end cutter. The presentation out of the box is excellent. Once removed from the box, everything went downhill. I cut a handful of cigars and every single one was was awful. The blades are not very sharp at all. The $2.99 cutters at the cigar store cut better than this. This is the first &#34;high end&#34; cutter that I have owned and will definitely not buy another colibri. If you are looking for a sharp cutter this is not the one.",0
5,"My mom loves these lipstick cases. Made her happy so I'm happy :) Really nice for the price, doesn't look cheap at all.",1
5,Amazing!,1
3,"As always, Croakies eyeglass retainers are of very good quality.  But, this pack of two that I received today  are not colorful at all, both are very dark colors, unfortunately.  I realize when ordering one does not have the option to choose the colors of the handmade items but to pack two very dark colors together for sale doesn't make sense.  I am very disappointed.",0
1,"These earrings are gorgeous don't get me wrong, but the 8th time I wore the silver pair they broke in the same spot near the clasp just like the other reviews said. Super sad as I loved these things. I guess I will continue to wear the other pair until they break. Seller really ought to refund or send another set for those of us with broken earrings, so buyer beware",0
4,Fits nice. Material is a little thin.,1
2,Broke in 2 weeks,0
5,Used it for keeping warm. Can use around neck and also pull over ears. Love it.,1
1,The necklace was worn twice before it broke.,0
1,"Very disappointed with this dress.  It arrived with a hole in the seam at the neckline, but worst if all was the overall quality.  It was so bad that I wouldn't even use it as a witch costume for Halloween. Will be returning it!",0
5,Always fast shipping! Nice material and works great for my UV resin projects!,1
2,"Very cute dress but once I washed it shrunk super small, looks like a tank top now.",0
5,"perfect for quick jaunts to the store, lightweight and colorful, nice print design",1
5,Works well...comfortable when hiking.,1
5,The price was great and the glasses are very comfortable,1
5,Well made product. Fit is good and easily adjustable.,1
4,My daughter loves it. She is 10 amd not a girly girl- BUT she is into cosplay- especially animae. For whatever reason this hat spoke to her:) it works great and is really soft. It‚Äôs not super heavyweight the wars are king and they work well. No issues. Super soft!,1
5,&#60;3,1
5,"Love this top! Small fits great, I'm 5'4 @ 130 lbs. Highly recommend.",1
2,It didn't fit very well and some of the sewing was off.,0
1,"I didn't like it, it comes off very easily with just a little pull.",0
5,"I was in search for a thin wallet. Having a purse nowadays is a burden, so having the closure for coins and bills is a great feature!<br />Love it!",1
5,Love it! Great colors and perfect over a swimsuit.<br /><br />**update** I've worn this for a couple hours and the straps broke/came unstitched,1
5,I purchased a few of these. One for myself and others for gifts. I'm very pleased with the look and feel of the crystal. It also came with two different chain options to wear it with. Super fast delivery and an awesome product.,1
5,Fits perfectly,1
3,"Not really sure these are actually Stance socks. Or if they are, the brand has changed. They're thin, not thick as my other pairs are, there are loose threads. And the design shown here doesn't actually appear on the Stance website. And they're remarkably small for &quot;large&quot; socks.",0
5,"Very well made, came with two remotes and two sets of charging cables! My nephew is going to be very happy!",1
1,Mala calidad de materiales,0
5,"Attractive, lightweight, warm hearted vest.",1
5,It was too small.,1
5,Great price and hard to find like this style for little girls.,1
1,Plastic cheap things and they came all scratched up,0
3,"Works fine but on mine the mesh is not straight on one side which makes it curve funny and also looks less than ideal.  Clasp works well, resizing was not too difficult.  Bracelet was good length with only about 1 inch excess length which just lays inside the outer part of bracelet.<br /><br />Also, the pictured watch tool was not included with my bracelet.",0
1,I wore the sun earrings ONE time and the sun fell off through a crack. One time.,0
5,"Bought these for my 3 year old son. He loves to wear them around the house and to bed. I am glad they stay on snug (although they have a little room to grow) since he wears a size 10 shoe. I wish they had more of a grip on the hardwood floors, but over all they were exactly what I wanted!",1
2,"Looks good but,  no holes so no fresh air,  the goggles fog up.  Also no soft rubber, only hard plastic.  Not comfortable.  I threw them away.",0
1,"I was very exciting when my boots came yesterday, just to be disappointed with them. I love the color, they are very vibrant. What I don't like is that it was a struggle to put just one of them on. To top that off the size of the top of the boot should be wider. My calf are not that big, but I am not about to get the boots pull all the way up like they are supposed to be because they stop in the middle of my calf.<br /><br />1 stars because I am not able to wear them the way they are supposed to be worn.",0
2,not what i expected,0
2,It is ok. Not what I imagined.,0
2,Fabric is thin,0
5,I bought one of these for myself and a wine colored one for the wife. I'm absolutely happy with it. The quality looks slightly questionable in the photo but when I got this thing in person it's beyond what I expected especially at its price. I'm very happy and plan to buy these for the family next Christmas. They work well. Fit snugly but not too tight by any means and are both good at blocking wind and retaining heat. Absolutely happy with it.,1
3,"First, the product picture shows the ENTIRE MASK as purple, this is not the case. The top and bottom ""seam"" are white. I ordered these BECAUSE they were supposed to be entirely purple, different from other colored masks.<br />Second, they are thinner than most disposable masks, sure they are ""3-layer"", but thin layers.<br />Thirdly, they came vacuum packed, so any fold, wrinkle and indentation are permanent. So 12 of the 50 I won't be able to wear.  All of the above are very disappointing after finally finding a face mask seller that Amazon fulfilled so I didn't have to wait 2 months to get them. :(",0
4,"This lovely brooch appears just as pictured.  The clear crystals on the dancer's bodice give a lacey appearance. The faceted skirt is a golden topaz color and backed by a mirror.  This dancer is dainty, but shiny and eye-catching too. My only suggestion is to change the orientation of the pin - as it is now, the brooch would fall off quite easily if the pin comes unlatched. Comes tucked inside a small black cardboard jewelry box. The brooch is attached to a card and sealed in plastic for protection.<br /><br />I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
2,"Bought these to replace the ugly flowered ones that came in the pack... However, the product that these bands are suppose to carry\retain fell out and was lost. Was a waste of $50-60 dollars, and a large disappointment.",0
2,"Quality is poor, but fit is good.  Most bands are too big for my wrist",0
5,We bought a few of these. Those hot summer days working outside will now be a bit cooler.<br />We decided on this one because you tie it around your head...so it fits anyone. We have some family who come to help get the gardens ready...so everyone get one to use.,1
5,I wear this to water aerobics fits perfectly,1
1,Arm holes were much to high. Zipper was difficult to use.,0
5,"Very cute!  Feels solid, great addition to a costume.",1
4,They are gorgeous I gave them to my mom for Mother's day.. she loved them but they were a little small and narrow for a size 5 ...,1
5,It‚Äôs very cute and soft.,1
2,"This is like a thin snakeskin material. not what i was expecting  Definitely not ""faux leather""",0
5,Fast shipping. Excellent product,1
3,Nice,0
3,I didn‚Äôt like the fit of the black pair of the same pants. They did not fit the same as the others and the length was too short.,0
5,"This is a wonderfully sturdy umbrella especially for windy areas. This will negate the necessity of replacing an umbrella after it‚Äôs turned inside-out a few times. It‚Äôs nice looking, has really strong reinforced ribs with springs to help keep them taut, has double-cloth layers on the canopy, and is just all around a really quality umbrella. The one downside to this extra sturdiness is that this umbrella weights much more than our compact umbrellas that we keep in our briefcases. I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll want to add that extra weight to our briefcases, but we‚Äôll definitely be stocking our automobiles with these extra-sturdy umbrellas.",1
3,Reminded me of something purchased from China,0
4,"This is super cute, and very flattering on! The material is a little thin which is why I am giving it 4 stars. But this is a great purchase for the price!<br />I am 5'7 145lbs and I ordered a M.",1
1,Cheap,0
4,Perfect beach coverup! I love it and the little garment bag was a nice addition especially since items like this sit without being used between trips. I have already photographed 3 models in this for my studio and plan on ordering another for myself. It's a little more transparent then I would like but it's still too gorgeous not to love it,1
5,Nice product!,1
3,My umbrella was damaged in shipping...the box was torn and the bottom solar light was cracked!,0
5,Exactly as described. Great for sun shades.,1
4,"Well packaged and arrived in a timely manner. Really like the shirt material and quality, but dow seem to run large in my opinion. I am 5'6 118 lbs 34C/27/34.",1
1,Looks more like a little girls dress not ventage.,0
2,Runs small. No stretch,0
3,"I love the color and design of this shirt, but it is waaaaaaaay too small. I ordered up several sizes and still too small.",0
5,"I am very happy with these masks.  The fabric is comfortable, breathable and the masks are well made.  The nose clip, filter pocket and adjustable ear pieces make them ideal.",1
2,"I was so happy with my new sunglasses, until after a few days, I picked them up & the lense fell out. Can't get it to stay in, so I'll be sending them back. Too bad!",0
5,I recently started playing tennis again after 6-7 years away. I didn't want to spend a fortune on clothing but wanted to have what would make my return to the court easiest. These skirts fit the bill. I bought it in both navy and black and love them!,1
1,The fabric is worse than a rag on first wash!! Looked good until i washed it<br />So disappointed and these pants are not cheap! Why are the charging so much for such cheap fabric quality?,0
5,"This is a wonderful all-year dress that has entered heavy rotation this summer. It's gorgeous and flowy... and it has POCKETS!!!<br /><br />I get a ton of compliments on it whenever I wear it. It is flattering for multiple body types. I am plus sized and fairly big and it looks great on me. Although if you have a large bosom like I do I recommend either adding a tack where the fabric crosses in the front or a tank top underneath. It is also very long. I am 5'7"" and it skims the floor when I walk in bare feet<br /><br />In all I really love this dress.<br /><br />Five Stars",1
2,"I liked the fit of the dress, however, it was pretty see through even with two layers and it was missing the button to hook at the top in the back.",0
5,"Love these jammies! They are so soft, and loose and comfy. They fit true to size and I'm looking forward to sleeping and lounging in them.",1
1,Wish I saw a review before buying. Coarse material and looks like a big mens tee. Not vibrant either,0
5,"These leggings are such a great bargain and so comfortable! Worked out in them a few times and didn't have any issues with them falling down or bunching. I'm 5'7, 165 pounds and on the curvy side and a large fits perfect! Will definitely be buying these in multiple colors.",1
3,Hard to breath through in the heat. Blocks sun great but not a super breathable fabric. Be prepared to sweat alot. Design printed nicely and held up to being washed a few times. Over all great for riding motorcycles and blocking sun and dust. Not good if u work outside for long hours  and have to wear a mask like me. Also feels a little tight to the face even with adjustable string tightened fully.,0
5,"This is a nice, solid, heavy charm.  It is threaded so it usually stays in the section of the bracelet that I want it in.  I can't believe how detailed it is.",1
3,"I originally ordered a Large but it was so tight, so I sent it back and ordered the XL, it fit better but the length is too short, otherwise it's really cute!",0
1,"0 stars. This is absolute trash. I went 2, TWO, sizes up and it didn't make it passed the middle of my thighs, it said runs small but damn. Should have known, you get what you pay for. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",0
5,Very comfortable wore for the first time and when I took the sandals off my feet did not even hurt! Will be looking for more BOX sandals!!,1
1,Run extremely small and aren‚Äôt made well!!,0
1,Ugly and cheap looking,0
3,it took to long to get it but it is very pretty,0
1,I received a jewelry box but there were NO earrings. Empty box.,0
3,I wanted to like this shirt. Once I opened it up the material feels soft and comfortable. The color was what I expected. The fit however wasn‚Äôt great. So let‚Äôs get started. First I hate buying clothes based on the sellers photos. This shirt is just another example. They lead you to believe it‚Äôs a fitted type shirt with tapered sides. Well it‚Äôs not and it sits baggy in the belly area. It‚Äôs not long so tucking it in isn‚Äôt an option. That‚Äôs fine as I like dressy casual style and the fact that I don‚Äôt have to tuck it in is a bonus. The problem is in the front. If you look at my picture you will see one side is 1 1/4‚Äù longer than the other. The last button stops at my belly button. This leaves you looking sloppy. Not a look you want when wearing a shirt like this. Due to the fact this is a dress shirt my review weighs heavy on that. It‚Äôs a shame because it does have some good aspects. The design and color was what I expected. The material is soft and thin so you won‚Äôt sweat to death wearing it. The stitching is solid with minor flaws and dangling strings. It fits well around my neck and isn‚Äôt itchy like some shirts. All in all this shirt could have been 4 or 5 stars based on price and looks but quality control is important and unfortunately I got one that perhaps slipped through the cracks. I can‚Äôt look past the unevenness in the front that draws so much attention do to the button placement on the shirt. If looking good is important to you I have to advise away from this shirt.,0
1,There is a black spot on the brim of the hat. Not happy about this. As you can see it‚Äôs not out of the original package.,0
5,"Cute, thin fabric similar to dri-fit. Fits well for adults.",1
5,I love these! They slide right on and off. They also wipe down really easy.,1
5,I used this for 2 straight months of cleaning out barns. Of course it didnt keep all the dust out but it overall massively improved my ability to work and not have a runny nose all day. also it washes well and is durable,1
5,"[[VIDEOID:247d0f31bcb69c23f16d84f4ae75fa1b]] I received this Crystal pendant in a fancy little package, along with a couple other surprises. It is caged in an attractive hold, with an eyelet for a necklace chain I'll add to it.<br />It was just the size I expected. Not too large or small. The glitter shine is stunning. As much as I adore it, I think it's worthy of giving to someone special as a gift. I will be getting another, or more.",1
2,these run a bout a half size small,0
3,very cheapy looking,0
4,Product fits well. I have long hair and am using this for a Dread Pirate Roberts costume and was worried it would slide off but it fits quite well. Nice material and easy to tie and untie.,1
4,Delivery was prompt & the product was all that it was described to be. Fairly priced and considering that Coach was out of stock.....it was right on time. My wife loved it.,1
1,bad quality,0
2,My had arrived deform. It has no shape. I have been trying to fix it but haven't had any success. The hat is ruined.,0
5,"When I tell you that I no longer experience paranoia, wardrobe malfunctions, or that thing women do where they look in the mirror a million times to make sure they look okay, I mean it. This cured the age old problem of camel toe lol",1
5,"I really like these jeans!  They fit me really well, although I am short and I have to hem everything.  I had bought the Gloria Vanderbilt Skimmer Capris before, so was hopeful the sizing would be consistent across the 2 types of pants, so I bought the jeans in the same size and they did fit!  I am excited to think I can trust the sizing in this brand and might try some more Gloria Vanderbilt items. The material is a nice texture, soft and a beautiful color.  They aren't like regular heavy denim jeans, they are a lighter denim that looks more dressy, which I prefer.  They are nice for summer.  They look really nice and I look forward to wearing them for a long time.",1
3,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 125lbs and it fit well but the material was too thin and the dress was too low cut for my taste, plus the blue was a little brighter than expected and so I ended up returning the dress.",0
2,"The quality of this strap is excellent; it's the design that's flawed.  The buckle end of the strap is too short to make it to the back of my wrist, it only gets about 3/4 of the way there.  It seems to be beautifully made but, as I said, poorly designed.  Not recommended",0
2,Went a size up from even the recommended size...still way too small.,0
5,"While these don't come with the little rubber stoppers, they are heavy enough that they don't slip out. Great...very pretty",1
5,"Great fit, perfect for my daughters triathlon.",1
1,This dress looks very nice but it is dirty and used there is also no head band or silver pin in front,0
5,good product well made,1
5,[[VIDEOID:fab1d8afcd4bd4871ad81ef6615ce1d2]] No complaints here. Loved the color and material.,1
1,This top is very poorly made I would not recommend it.,0

3,"my fianc√©‚Äôs bracelet broke, we contacted the seller & they had us return the old ones & sent us new ones (which we greatly appreciated). it broke a few days/weeks later, so we purchased the bracelets again. that next bracelet also broke, so we just gave up.",0
1,Not a good quality,0
5,Great gift for my wedding!!,1
1,"Item sells itself as a gift, yet does not allow you to send as a gift. You cannot include a message or receipt for them to exchange or return. I don't know the recipient's size. Probably wouldn't matter anyway because there's no size guide. How many inches for the waist is a size XLG?? It's a secret. Who is fulfilling or shipping this product? That's also a secret! After I purchased I contacted Lands End to find out how the receiver can exchange or return and they tell me they can't do anything about it because it's fulfilled by Amazon. ""Lands End is unable to process a return or exchange for items purchased on Amazon,"" but they're happy to let me buy another one in the right size! I bought the ""Aqua Breeze Dogs and Cats."" There are no Cats. Shoddy listing. No help. They don't care. This was supposed to be a fun gag gift. I would never spend $10 on a single pair of underwear otherwise. Very disappointed in this experience.üòïüòî",0
3,"I ordered this in November as a holiday dress. It arrived past the deadline and too late for me to use. Also, I ordered an XL according to the size chart, though I normally wear a medium. It was a little big. I probably could have gotten away with a medium, as it's stretchy. For reference, I am 5'3"" and weight about 145. The material is very heavy, so I wouldn't recommend wearing it dancing, which is what I had planned to wear it for. If you can get it in the right size, it will be pretty and flattering. I eventually got a refund but it took a lot of work and several phone calls.",0
1,"Poor quality, sent for refund, 3 months past still no refund after being promised one",0
5,Fun dress for warm days. Wear tie belt or don't. Mine is deep red beautiful and I get many compliments wearing it.,1

5,"I'm an experienced backcountry camper, solo, in groups and with the U.S. Marine Corps.  Have worn 80 pound packs and gone ultralight with 10 lbs or less.  So, I'm not easily impressed.  My oldest daughter joined the &lt;Boy> Scouts (it's not just for boys anymore!) and we needed to get her a pack quickly.  I imagined this one would fall apart in a weekend trip, because I hadn't heard of the brand and because the price was reasonable.  Torn between dishing out $200 at REI and doing a ""purchase and pray"" on this one, I flipped a coin.  Then thought.... well, I'm going with her, so if the bag really sucks, I'll just strap whatever's left onto my pack (internal frame, 70 lb, 1990's era, bombproof).  Bottom line -- the pack is great.  Designed like packs of 3-4x the price and seemingly just as durable.  She's spent 6 days living out of it so far without so much as a stuck zipper.  I bet she'll get at least twenty more scout trips out of it, and I'll probably be able to hand it down to the next kid in our family.  Two areas for clarity.  I do not believe the pack would live up to its full  40 pound rating (meaning, after a couple trips with legit 40 lbs inside and 15 pounds strapped to it, it will fail), and it is a small pack.  I wouldn't recommend this for a human over 6'0"" and 200 lbs plus.  Otherwise, this is a great solution!!!!",1
5,"Very nice,  .Grand daughter loved it",1
2,Impossible to put on,0
1,Size is too small. It was listed as a womans drawstring hoodie but when i received it in the mail it was more like a childs garment. Was not happy with it!!,0
1,Why do everyone colors not match everyone else‚Äôs I have a lot of covers that don‚Äôt match any wrist bands it is very frustrating throwing away a lot.,0
1,It‚Äôs useless. I would rather do it myself. Wish I had returned last week. Sorry for the wasted money.,0
2,Ok ok,0
2,Been looking for a long time for the perfect sized frame. These are it. Large enough but not so large they look like costume. Love that there are 4 pairs because I lose them daily.  Update.....now 3 of the 4 pairs have lost their pin. Soooo disappointed. Although I didn‚Äôt lose them I only have 1 pair (just took them out of box) left. What a shame that the pins fall out.,0
5,This is a great gift item! at first I thought it was broken but the catch is actually a twist off so that you can take off or add charms.,1
3,It definitely runs small. We purchased two sizes up and it's still quite tight.  The material is very thin and you are able to see anything you're wearing underneath. It is very comfortable though and looks as pictured.,0
5,Looks amazing!,1
2,"This top attracts animal hair and fuzzys so bad!!! The fit is weird too, kind of boxie and the sleeves don't feel right either. Would NOT recommend to anyone who works with animals, you will be lint-rolling every 10 minutes",0
5,Great<br />Box was all crushed and pkg torn but I got them just fine,1
1,The size chart was misleading. These were not for little girls they were for toddlers!  Must return!,0
2,I purchased this shirt and wore it once in August and washed and hung to dry. I just went to wear the shirt and the lettering and imagine was hardened and crumbled and not able to be worn again. Sad because the original wear and fit were comfortable!,0
5,What a great price for this!  It's all my husband's wears in the Winter for work.  Best bargain EVER!,1
3,"The bag is attractive and roomy. However, the dye bleeds for some reason. I have never owned any leather that bleeds when coming into contact with water. I set the bag on the vanity to remove the packing material, apparently, I set in on a few drops of water because when I moved the bag, the drops of water were brown. I wiped the bottom and sides of the bag with a damp paper towel, and the quite a bit of the dye came off. I guess if I keep rubbing, it will eventually stop coming off. I would expect better quality for a bag that costs almost $30.",0
4,Surprisingly comfortable. Lined with a soft material. Felt like the waist was a tad to big but overall a good buy.,1
4,Very cute and one of my new favs to wear with Jean's and tees. Worth it .,1
4,"Good quality, flattering fit. All cotton so can shrink",1
4,"Fit was true to size - grandson wears 4T, ordered a 4T.",1
3,Nice. Haven't worn but once. Weather here been in the 80's. Comfy.,0
5,My 2 year old was so excited when she saw this outfit. She thinks the bunnies are so cute. It fits her so well. The colors are so bright and happy. Great quality fabric.,1
2,"I have severely flat, wide feet. I thought these might help at work. They don‚Äôt; my feet hurt more than before. The side on the inner part of the foot, cuts into my feet where an arch is for a narrow-footed person. These seem to be for people with arches or at least with a narrower foot, so you may have different results.",0
3,"This dress is a great idea, but the skirt part of the dress is very stiff. I thought that washing it might help but it did not - the fabric is still very stiff and holds wrinkles.",0
3,I love the color!! But I am a little disappointed in the fit. I am typically a M size so that is what I ordered. But I can only wear a tank top under it. Anything would make it too tight. Other than that I like it.,0
4,"I received this swimsuit for free to test and review.<br /><br />Note to all. This is not a suit for wearing if you are going to be swimming laps, surfing, water skiing, or any thing other than wading in. The bottom is tied on and the ties are not secure enough to keep it on if there is external pressure of the water against them. You will lose the bottom and possibly even the top.<br /><br />The bottom is a small one. It is meant for smaller behinds, so if you have a bubble bottom, don't try this. It will not fit properly for full rear coverage. Think ultra low rise jeans.<br /><br />The top is made so that it cradles breasts, but if you size it incorrectly, you will pop out of the cups. Think push up bra style. This will fit under a c-cup, but be cautious if you are over that. Just as with bras, not every style or model will fit every body. Properly sized, this adds a bit of cleavage without having half of the breast sitting on a shelf, just waiting to pop out if you decide to play volleyball. (On second thought, unless it is a racy game of volley ball, don't play in this suit unless you are an a/b cup.)<br /><br />The material is soft and the suit is well made. There are no loose threads or obvious missed stitches. It should hold together great for at least this season's summer.<br /><br />It arrived in a PVC bag that left the smell all through this suit. I had to wash it four times in lingerie detergent to get the odor out. There is no way I could even try it on before doing this, the smell was burning my nose. While the bag seems like a good idea, I won't buy or review another suit by Raintropical because of it. I am very sensitive to odors and I don't like having to wash something several times to remove strong odors.",1
1,Box was dirty/stained. Both cufflinks had a sticky film/residue and one of the cufflinks was made with a badly worn casing where the words were barely visible. What a waste of $25! I was looking forward to giving these to my husband as a birthday present. I will definitely be returning these... and I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to return this exact box/cufflinks because they've CLEARLY been used before!,0
5,I love this hat I used it in one of my live streams and my friends loved it,1
4,The top was a perfect fit! The bottoms were quite small and tight.,1
5,"Okay. I‚Äôve bought so many swimsuits on amazon and returned so many swim suits on amazon. This was not one. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 115 lbs and normally I wear a size small. Reading the reviews, I bought a size medium and it fits perfectly! Really nice quality, built it cups, and not see through at all. I will for sure be buying this in multiple colors. Really flattering suit and just the perfect amount of cheeky ;)",1
1,A necklace with the letters Love on it. So flimsy it broke second day I wore it! The chain is very thin and tangled very easily!!Loved the necklace hope there is something they can do about it!!!,0
1,Sent back,0
2,"The image is very misleading.  The display does NOT appear with blue clock digits and green seconds digits.  While they DO appear blue and green in a strange way for 3 seconds when the light button is pressed, once the light is off they appear as standard dark gray LCD numerals -- not at all what is implied in the photograph.<br /><br />The &#34;manual&#34; is a piece of paper with broken English instructions.  It arrives in a small plastic bag without a box.<br /><br />It functions as a typical LCD digital watch with all of the standard features.",0
1,"It's supposed to be comfortable, but it feels to be just the opposite. The trunks I got from Walmart 5 years ago are still more comfortable than these brand new ones. Not to mention, I understand there will be a size difference, but these felt like a large when they were labeled as a XXXL. Also, it is clear that they were designed for a 38&#34; slim waist, not a 38&#34; husky waist. so unless you are a tall twig, don't get these trunks.",0
5,Fits as expected. Buy in your regular size.  Lovely design.  Would recommend,1
1,My bag broke literally the week after. I am trying to reached the seller for a refund but It does not give me the option.,0
3,It ok ..,0
5,"Installation is pretty easy: Remove the screws on your unit with the included Torx driver ÔºõI have the Garmen Vivoactive and ordered these bands as the price for 3 replacement bands can't be beat. You do need to use both of the tools to hold one side steady and twist the opposite way with the other side. It is a screw that comes off on one side and a long pin that holds the band in place. I actually like these bands better because they have a little ridge at the end of the band that prevents the band from slipping out of the hold. The original band did not have this. The bands are very  comfortable, not too stiff, but hold very well.",1
5,"These Charms are the best I have found on Amazon.com.  The Charms are truly beautiful and polished.  If you want a charm to catch your eye and be a memento of where you have been, Rembrandt Charms are of good quality.  I have ordered from them several times from Amazon.com and would do it again.",1
2,The bracelet was very Pretty. However the prongs bent every time I put a shirt on. Catching on everything.,0
4,"It looks very cheap, but once on it was light, fit well and cute.",1
2,They were huge. I ordered a small and had to give them to my friend.,0
2,these do not block the sun at all if you are looking to keep the sun out of your eyes do not buy these if you are just looking for glasses to wear then these are your glasses,0
4,Be sure to double check the sizes. This one was too small for me but hope it will fit soon.,1
4,This is the second I ordered.  The first one was too big.  I could not return it because it was beyond the return period.  But I am happy with this one.  It is very comfortable.,1
5,This top is so cute!  I have ordered the blue and the white!,1
1,"These are overpriced junk, they don‚Äôt keep time out of the box and if you are like me and give it as a gift only to find out it‚Äôs junk out of the box. Save your money and buy something that has a reputation for good quality.",0

2,"I received this duck Apple Watch band in on Monday afternoon and by Wednesday (of that same week) I noticed some peeling of the graphic coming up on the edge‚Ä¶<br /><br />I‚Äôm super disappointed by it.

5,"Fit perfectly, looked great and IÔ∏è LOVED the pockets!!",1
5,Was a great buy. They appear small but I fill them both with groceries. Keeps everything cool!,1
3,"I was disappointed in the thickness of the silver.  I love the Celtic design, but it feels so thin that it may break.",0
4,"Shoes were in good condition, but the size is not as expected. My daughter wears a toddlers size 6, and these shoes were way too small. Had to return them, and unfortunately they didn't have the next size up. :(",1

5,"So far, so good.....keep out moisture, seem sturdy yet still flexible.",1
1,"My son purchased this and he couldn't use it, the velcro was failing right from the get go.  We returned it for a refund right away.",0
5,They fit and feel great. Nice inexpensive sleeper.,1
5,I only like earrings that have a lever back and are hard to lose and yet they are comfortable. So these earrings are perfect. I wear PEACH COLORED tops a lot and these earrings are beautiful. I got them immediately and they were in a box and protected from being damaged.,1
1,"Poor quality. You can see the stencil square of the iron on decal (see pic). The shoulder straps are very thin, and stretch out just putting it on. The material of the shirt is very thin, and I would expect it to start rolling up at the bottom.  Even under the $10.00 price point, I‚Äôm still returning.",0
5,Pretty & classy studs. I bought 14mm and are light weight but the back is not strong enough to keep them straight. I replaced for a bigger one. Hope sometime get 10mm in gold.,1
4,I really liked the color and soft flowing fabric but even with the care I took to make sure the sizing was right it still didn't fit.  Back it went.,1
5,"I was actually trying to buy the Navy blue colored belt, but received a dark grey belt, which apparently was my mistake. I liked the belt I received since it was just as advertised and for a good price.",1

2,Too small and holes not cut properly to fit my child..,0
5,The EagleUS Bikini cross body link chain necklace is fun jewelry.<br />my and i both enjoyed it. it looks great on and off. It covers a little but is very sexy.<br />it is heavy and made well.<br />i recommend getting one of these little outfits and having fun,1

5,This bracelet came in a sealed bag and the sealed bag was put in a small black velvet pouch.  It was a well made item and it looked exactly like the one in the ad. The metal parts were shiny and the braided leather is very nice.  I don't remember if this bracelet comes with different sizes or not but the one I got was small size and it fitted my small wrist nicely (see the picture.)  I like this bracelet because of the design and the material.<br />I got this item with a discount price in exchange for unbiased review.,1
5,Great inexpensive red stretch belt.  I already had this belt in pink and I have ordered it in black as well.  Be sure and check the size.,1
3,I was excited when some reveiws mentioned it was on the larger size. I am usually a S-M but wanted to size up to get a really oversized fit. I have the same brand jersey in red from goodwill in a large so I thought it would be fine. It was not as big as I expected. Should have gotten an XL. Too much to return so I will just have to deal.,0

5,Fit is awesome! Great glasses! Amazing price!,1
2,"The sizing is way off.  My baby is 6 months and I ordered the 3-9M size.  When I got it, the tag said 9M, and it's honestly big enough for my 2-year-old to wear.  I figured I would try to just wash it to shrink it instead of taking it back, but it hardly shrunk. I'm disappointed because these were supposed to be her Christmas jammies, but they are huge. If the sizing wasn't so weird, this would be really cute.  It seems well made and is very warm.  Maybe I'll try to turn it into a sweater for my toddler, haha...<br />*<br />***Update: On the plus side, this company had great customer service and upon reading my review sent me another pair free of charge in the size 70, 4-8M.  This was so nice of them, but unfortunately this size was still way too big on my baby.  She is 6M old and weighs about 16lbs, and she was still a bit swallowed up by it.  Also, I will have to note that the button holes were too small for the buttons, and I actually couldn't get it fully buttoned up. :/ I really wanted to like these jammies as they are so cute, and the company was so kind, but they just aren't going to work out.",0
1,this necklace is described as dainty.  It should be described as  dime store crappy.  It is white gold so you'd think the clasp would be decent but it's so small I can't hold it open to put it on.  The chain is so thin that it knots easily and then you need a jewelers glass to see it they are so impossible to untangle.  this necklace is not wearable.  A waste of money.,0
4,I bought this as a present for my granddaughter. She picked it out. Haven't given it to her yet. I can't speak to the quality as of now,1
4,"The ring is super cute. I was a bit disappointed with how small the box is, and the detail is not as great as in the picture. I am not completely disappointed, but happy",1
5,LOVE these glasses. Super effective and affordable,1

1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED! Absolutely NOT 14K gold. Very cheap piece of jewelry. Sorry I purchased this piece of garbage. Especially since I ordered TWO and was only sent ONE, therefore paying TWICE as much for ONE horrible item. Save yourself and go to the Dollar Store and buy something of similar quality.",0
5,Thank you so much! They are adorable and sparkly and came just in time! I would definitely order these again. Exactly as stated!,1

3,Runs too big,0
5,Beautiful quality! My son loves it!,1
2,Donar like,0
5,Great.  My daughter loves it.  She says it is warm.  It is NOT a sweatshirt more like a super heavy tech shirt or super thick tshirt.  Mu daughter loves it though.,1
5,Bought them for my daughter they fit perfect. U can take the inside insole out and place your child feet on it to make sure the boots are big enough because knowing kids they always say yes they fit and with in a few days they don‚Äôt. The lights on the boots are a perfect!!! Overall she loved them and you can not beat the price!!!,1
5,It was just what I was looking for.,1
5,Great,1
3,The snaps are way harder to unhook then they look! It takes so long that I end up not using it!,0
5,I comfortably take it everywhere for comfort and need.,1
1,I was very disappointed when this shirt arrived. It was I thought going to be a sweatshirt. That's what it is described as in the ad. Material is very light. Thinner than tee shirt material. Very large in size. I'm sending mine back.,0
1,It is just super cheaply made. Don‚Äôt waste your time.,0
4,Great shirt<br />The sizing is a bit off<br />I had to order a size up<br />Looks and feels great,1
5,I'm 5' 6&#34; - 160 lbs and usually wear size 8 to 10. I ordered a size XL. It fit great! The material is soft cotton and stretchy. Happy customer. Well look into purchasing other dresses from this company.,1

5,Really comfy!! And pretty!!,1
2,Some of the grommets started to tear fabric after about two months. And I wasn't wearing it tight.,0
4,"Love that the bag is removable, so on light days my daughter use as a backpack and on heavy days use the pulley. Easy to assembly worth the price",1
2,"I got this because I liked the idea of just bringing one case around, and in that aspect it fits the bill. But here are the pros:<br /><br />- the mirror (which I wouldn't have used anyway) fell off within a couple weeks<br />- the tubes for solution are poorly designed and leak<br />- there don't need to be two tubes - I see this as more of a travel case, not one that should have solution and cleaner, so one tube holding about 3 ounces of solution would be best<br />- tweezers? Really? Who uses tweezers in their daily contacts routine?<br />- the case that comes with it is small, which is fine, but that means the compartment that holds the case is not big enough for a standard-sized case<br /><br />Look elsewhere for a better-designed case.",0
5,"Really pretty, but a little heavy for my ears.  I am giving them to my daughter because I know she will love them and be able to wear them comfortably.",1

5,"First off..<br />COLOR NOT AS EXPECTED- We purchased the ""pink"" shade, which is actually more of a neon Coral. I'm not complaining, we love it, but there is that for your knowledge.<br /><br />This Girls 2-Piece Swimsuit Strap Lace Up Solid Beach Sport Bikini Set is absolutely adorable! My little girl, 10 years old, 4 ft 11 in, is usually a girls size 12 or 14 in children's sizing, sometimes a women's x-small as she is tall for her age. It's cute and fun and nothing is hanging out, great compromise between children's wear and what mom wants. This is a great quality piece! And what a deal!<br /><br />The straps do tie at the top and in this photo they are double knotted and still look good, they,are long enough. The bottoms cover good enough!<br /><br />Will update if thoughts change over time<br /><br />We highly recommend!",1
5,"It fit as expected and I had to figure out if I should go with a Medium, or a Large since the size run small. I'm 5'4 and weigh 125 and I normally wear a small, but the Large was perfect. And shipping came extremely quick.",1
3,"This was part of an order for 2 Polo shirts. They arrived on time, but I quickly realized I needed size XL instead of the large. Returned both shirts and ordered the larger size. Amazon made it easy to return them and get the size I needed.",0
5,"Purchased 2 different sizes for my two granddaughters. One came sized correctly. The other one did not. These dresses are not returnable I found out but fortunately Amazon credited my account. I have reordered the larger size for the older girl. Hopefully that comes in the proper size. Amazon said to keep or donate the dress that came in the wrong size. The younger granddaughter said she loves the dress and now she can wear the dresses two days in a row, since she has an extra one.",1

5,Good quality. Thick plastic. As described.,1
2,"Ehh... great size and compartments but it was just really low quality to me. The removable dividers and ring section felt like it would tear or rip very easily. I have a travel jewelry bag by Conair (bought on Amazon, it's purple & black) that was about $12 and it's amazing but just not the most flattering looking case. I wanted a pretty jewelry travel case for my wedding pieces but decided to just stick to my Conair bag.",0
5,"My wife does a lot of fast exercise walks, as well as yoga. She's always trying out leggings. It can be tricky to find ones that are comfortable, made well, and hold up under lots of washing and drying. I got her these, and they are among the better leggings she's tried. The fabric is very soft and really flexible. The fit is right on target, as cited in the product description. The back zipper seems like a good idea, but my wife has not found a good use for it. Likewise, the pockets are rather small and not good for much. After several wash/dry cycles, the fabric and fit continue to be like new. These are now one of the regulars for my wife when she goes to the track or does yoga. I recommend them.",1
2,I ordered this product for an early 2000s bachelorette party.  I am 5‚Äô0 feet all and 175 pounds. I purchased the XL. I expected it to be too long but it was 6 inches too long on me. The material was itchy and see through. I returned this item.,0
1,Said it was 100% linen but tag says 45% cotton and 55% linen.  False advertising,0
1,Really hurts the ear. Too much squeezing on earlobe.,0
5,Needed a case I can find.<br />Like this a lot.,1
5,"These were for my 9 year old. Great ski sock. Thin so the boots don't pinch. Warm. Everything you need, nothing you don't. For those that can't give up the bulk, Eurosocks does make a thicker version, at least for adults. I won't wear any other ski socks now, except maybe patagonia.",1
2,If you are about 5' to 5'2&#34;  these pants may fit you.  I am much taller and according to the description they should have been fine.  These were PETITE in length.  I love Columbia pants and have many pair so this was disappointing to have them be about 2&#34; shorter than my other similar Columbia REGULAR length pants.  Other than the length the fit was true to size.,0
5,I bought this and went to an NHRA event.  At the event both Big Daddy Don Garlits asked to wear it for pics and then Leah Pruett wanted it.  lol.  So no more hat.  But it was worth it!,1
5,"bought these for my husband (pre-diabetic) who really needs comfy shoes -- 6'4"" and rough on shoes!  loves them and still has them 1.5 years later!!!  well worth the $$",1
5,Nice statement piece of jewelry. Falls well and is not too heavy.,1
5,Super cute and stylish. Using my cell phone is also easy without having to take my gloves off!,1
1,"Too large, thought that it was smaller in size",0
3,Top was too big and bottoms were too small,0
5,"I like that this suit is snug like it needs to be for swimming laps but has some padding in the bra area for discretion.  This is still flattering for by the side of the pool, too.",1
1,plastic,0
3,It's ok,0
1,Cheap and not accurate sizing,0
5,It fits perfectly and looks great! I'm 5'3 about 120lbs. I followed the chart measurements and ordered a medium. I'd reccomend it for a fun outfit to Oktoberfest!,1
3,"I was not expecting this to be as large as it was, so depending on what you are looking for that could be a pro or con.  The colors were not very vibrant, they are all very light.  Not what I expected, but on the plus side, the beads are sparkly and I hung it from my rear view mirror so I can see the sparkles which would be hard to see if wearing as a necklace.",0
5,The quality was nice. Thinner material but not bad at all. I'm 5'2 135 pounds and pear shaped so the size small was perfect for me. Nice and flowy at the shoulders and a little more fitted at the hip. If you want a much looser or flowy fit you can size up and it will still look nice.,1
5,...And even the purple color I ordered was not over the top -- like I thought based on the pictures -- it was more like a Royal Blue. This model is Amazon's choice for a reason.,1
4,"I have not worn this item out in public yet, but I love it so far! It fits me perfectly (5'3"", 125lbs) and looks even better than the photographs. I'm giving it just 4 stars because I want to see how it holds up. I'll update when I have something more to add.",1
5,ITS LEGIT ITS AWSOME IT PRICEY BUT LOOKING GOOD DOES COME WITH A PRICE BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT,1
5,Great hat for a Cousin Eddie costume,1
5,The mask is comfortable and came with 2x PM2.5 filters.,1
3,No pictures please,0
3,The dress looks much nicer in the picture. Wouldn't order it again.,0
5,Tumbling dice!!!,1
1,"See through and does not fit, runs very small at waste. Idk how they show a pregnant woman wearing this bc I am not pregnant and def did not fit my around my waste.",0
1,Awful. Nothing like the picture,0
5,Great quality and Fit perfectly.,1
2,"Another beautiful dress but again, the sizes are wrong.",0
3,Ordered a meduim looks like an XXL,0
5,"Perfect for my eight year old. Has held up very well, for how rough they play.",1
3,"Cute design, but larger than I expected. I was thinking this would hug my earlobes but it dangled down a bit more than i thought so I returned them.",0
3,Simple accessories.  The hat is really flimsy.  My husband was able to use the tie and suspenders.  I was worried because he‚Äôs 6‚Äô6 and we were worried they would snap.  Luckily they didn‚Äôt.,0
1,"Bought an XL which on the size chart is a 16-18. I wear a 16-18 in every dress I own, or an XL if it's stretchy or doesn't do number sizing. So I bought an XL and it felt like a medium. Didn't fit my arms, came up slightly below my crotch, and was horrible. If you regularly wear an L or XL, pass on it bc it won't fit. Even if you buy XXL. There's no way an XXL is actually going to fit a woman who traditional wears an XXL. No way.",0
1,Using unlicensed covers in their own video fits with the watch design. An abomination of stolen designs. Disgusting.,0
4,"I ordered an 8/9 for my very petite 10 year old girl. It fit her perfectly, once I adjusted the straps.",1
4,"Very cute item. Larger than appeared in picture. The only downfall, the. Racelet portion does not stretch, unless you have a tiny hand, it won‚Äôt fit. You‚Äôll have to hold the bracelet.",1
5,"The watch is beautiful, and it arrived a week earlier than estimated! No would suspect that it costed fewer than five dollars! It is well-worth the price.",1
2,not happy its to wide in the pants poket hard to get out of the pocket,0
2,"Kind of bulky, looks cheap and turned my skin green.",0
5,Love it,1
1,This product is not for those who are DD+. It will not work for you if you are gifted.,0
3,Order a size or two bigger. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 160 and ordered a large. It‚Äôs just a little to tight and short in the arms.,0
5,"Excellent for keeping my pants up, and I love the extra attention I get going through metal detectors!",1
5,"Great quality, great price, fast shipping",1
2,these are strictly to be able to say you have a mask on. They are pretty and comfortable but only functional if you need them for a costume.,0
3,"its made of polished cotton, so it has no stretch or give anywhere...I normally wear a small ( I'm only 5'2&#34; 140 lbs) and ordered a Medium but was still too small in the width and looked like someone much taller could wear it. Returned...",0
1,Swallowed me,0
1,"I NEVER give one star ratings. The outfit came later than promised, looked pretty much as described, but I couldn't try it on because I could not get past the strong ammonia smell of the garment. The seller offered half of my money back and I could keep the garment.....no email add. to respond to. I should have paid attention to the other reviews:(",0
3,"It's OK.  It looks cute, but the Credit card slots appear to be glued. This causes some of the slots to be glued together and some of the slots are deeper than others so your cards get stuck behind others.",0
1,Product fell apart almost instantly,0
3,"Loved it, until the main section lining tore within 6 months.... good organizer, zippers work really well, outer purse still looks great. I use purses much longer than 6 months....  so am afraid to replace this one.",0
1,"Receive this product with a dead battery!!! Really, you would think if you pay for a product you would get a product that works. I would assume that's how this consumer thing is suppose to be....what a rip off!!!<br /><br />Part two: After receiving a second watch after the dead battery fiasco we gifted it to a family member. Only this time the whole face comes of the band and next their is knock off brand name under the watch face......Straight GARBAGE!! Do not buy this piece if crap.",0
5,I‚Äôm not one to rave about socks but these are AMAZING! I bought the neon ones and I now have the other colors in my cart!,1
4,"I love this dress! I Came back for the red one after buying the navy.<br />I'm 5' 8&#34; and t is long enough on me.. the front kind of dips up, but i actually am wearing it backwards. I like it best that way..<br />I think it's meant for someone a little less buxom (36DD here)..but if i turn it around it totally takes the weird pucker away from under my arms. I would recommend for the price. Fabric is thick and not at all cheap looking to me.",1
1,"This scarf does not have any alpaca on it. It is the cheapest tourist souvenir you can find for $2.00 in the streets of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.",0
1,Pants are really small for the size that you picked.  Also the fabric is too thin very light . and the pants is not adjustable for the inside.  Totally disappointed .  I have to return it back. ',0
4,"Okay, I really really like this. Its comfy and lightweight but a big BUT be very careful washing it! I washed it with colors on a color mode in my washer and the ink died splotches all over my clothes. I had<br />To throw the entire load out. Wash alone!",1
1,Extremely low quality.  I've got small hands and my fingers barely fit through the finger parts.  There's sloppily placed glue everywhere.  The fingers are partially glued to the palm areas making it impossible to fully open your hand without tearing them.  They feel like they're going to fall apart immediately.  The photos were taken seconds after opening the package.,0
1,The size is very largo y very small,0
5,ITS A PRESENT FOR MY LITTLE PRINCESS AND SHE LOVE IT,1
2,For me this arrived looking like a giant clown suit. I'm returning at only because of the giant stain I have no clue what it is but it looks like iron marks I don't know but.,0
3,The LED wasn‚Äôt very bright. The material felt cheap but this product was definitely on the inexpensive side so my expectations were basically met,0
1,"I bought this item without reading reviews, not happy just and that's all the review I'm giving this item.... was a waste of my $$$",0
1,Do not order. Misleading. No batteries or charger included in package even though advertised with 2 batteries and charger.,0
2,"[[VIDEOID:d1da0844c9cc1c0bfbede298a07a5d8a]] Here are the pros and cons of this ring:<br />Pros- The ring is pretty, and the band is sturdy. I really love the shine from the opal stone, and the stones around it shine brightly in the light. The design is beautiful! This is a good temporary ring (and I mean, very short-term) if you really love opal stones.<br /><br />Cons- After wearing it for a few times, here's what the ring needs for improvement. I wish the edges of the band were smoother and not so boxy... it leaves a bit of uncomfortable space between my fingers, but it‚Äôs minimal. The band also feels scratchy around my surrounding fingers and it snags hair. Also amongst the inside of the ring, the middle part (where the stone is positioned) may scratch your finger when you're putting it on and off because, as I have said before, it is not a smooth texture. I did not notice this until I have worn other rings.",0
5,"Just beautiful. Perfect size, great twist on feature.I feel it will be more secure than the magnet closing ones. Bought as a gift for my granddaughter. Price is great! She wanted one last year but they seems overpriced. This one is great! Highly recommended for price,quality and value.",1
3,The clip is  bit flimsy and will stretch out if you put too much money in it. But it's more about team representation than functionality. Right?,0
3,I'm a small woman and it almost fits like a skull cap.  Definitely not as pictured.,0
5,"Quality is exceptional, colors are vibrant, pin is strong, delivered on time. Nothing to complain about here.",1
1,They were too large 3xl was sent. I tossed it in the trash.,0
5,just what i expected i like it,1
5,Nice and solid.,1
5,"Breathable material great for three season wear.  Spring, Summer and Fall .  No strech but fits well. Follow the size charg.  Can be worn as a mini dress but I wear it as a boho top with leggings.  It fits in the bust and the style of this garment provides ample coverage for those of us with bigger hips.  I liked it so much I ended up buying it in 3 colors.  I normally wear US size 16W.",1
5,Love these!!!! Amazing quality for the price! I still have worn the same one for months!! Will never order another kind again! Same quality as what i got it pierced with!,1
2,Ok glasses for the price. Uncomfortable after long bike rides. Fog easy. But around 20 dollars. Get what you pay for...,0
1,Not a beanie! Very dissatisfied!,0
1,see through,0
5,I got these for my niece who loves lady bugs. They are SO cute and super sparkly. I would highly recommend them.,1
3,"Very light material, but it feels like the cheap workout clothes my wife buys from Target, almost dainty.  They're very baggy throughout, so order one size down.",0
2,You have to stretch it out and even then it creeps up like a cone head. Hoping I can use it in the garden. Nothing like the model.,0
2,"Bought a child L and it was barely bigger than the M and did not fit at all. We couldn‚Äôt even use it for our photo session. The adult sizes were off too and the shirts did not have the Henley button look as described. Pants were narrow but very long, and short shoulders are very wide. Adult shirts are stretchy and warm but the pants have almost no stretch in them.",0
3,none,0
5,"Great walking hat, goes great with my walking shirt",1
1,I bought these for my daughter and the first time she wore them for less than an hour they turned her finger green,0
5,Gorgeous! Colors are beautiful. Great value for the money!,1
5,Goes well with my Vette!,1
3,I didn't like how this fits. Any little thing sticks to the material making it look dirty. I wouldn't purchase this again. I ended up giving it away.,0
5,"Got so many compliments. I love it! I'm a size 6, so got a medium. The waist was tight but rest loose. But still a great fit. I dress it up with flower colors.",1
3,Too small and kind of expensive,0
5,Bought this for my mother and she loved it! Such a wonderful purse and absolutely beautiful!,1
1,It looks pretty at first but it isn't 92 sterling silver as described. I would return it if I didn't have to go to alot of trouble to do it. Would never buy from this seller again unless they make it right? I will let y'all know!,0
3,"The material is soft and pattern super cute, it's just hot! It is not itchy or stuck to skin, but the breathability of the fabric is equal to wearing a plastic bag. Would be great if it were cotton or part cotton.",0
3,The body of the purse is nice but the straps are too short and very cheap looking. I've thought about redoing the straps.,0
1,I sent these back.  Brand name was totally different and were too small.  Abric was thicker and not what I received prior.,0
3,Fits small,0
5,This is a great video.  Easy to see and easy to follow.  The overhead shots let you see the folds exactly.,1
5,"My wife loves it, it's super soft!",1
5,Love it!!,1
5,They fit perfectly and my nephew loves them.,1
2,It's nice but the ribbons wouldn't pop open so I had to return it back to Amazon.,0
3,"Not long enough, should have a few more inches for us fat guys at size 38",0
5,"I love my waist trainer. It runa a little smaller than i thought but, it gives me more of an incentive to lose weight. Fast shipping. Great buy!!",1
1,"Wow, ordered up 2 sizes and still WAY too small. This is actually like a childs size shirt...",0
4,Good Good,1
3,"The shorts fit fine. The waist of the top is a bit too loose and big. The chest of the top is too tight. In other words, if you have a bigger chest and smaller waist, this top doesn't fit well on either part. It was cheap though, so worth it for a few wears.",0
5,These are very thick and soft tights. I think they will hold up well. They would fit a toddler in 2T-3T very well without looking saggy.,1
5,Exactly what I wanted. Compact yet roomy. Good construction.,1
1,Cheap material compared to what u buy in the store. Not glad I purchased these on line.,0
3,"It is a nice shirt. Long, which I like. The only complaint that I have is that it is tight in the arms/shoulders/bust. It fits perfectly from the bust down. That being said, it is a good shirt for the price. I am going to keep it and try to stretch it out to make it more loose, because I do like the shirt.",0
5,Super cute top you can just throw it in the washer with your regular clothes holds up great especially for the price.,1
1,"If you are buying this, be aware it will not last you if you treat it as an everyday boots. It came with scratches and the glue will fail pretty fast. I am sure I will have to get it glued or tossed out soon.",0
1,Super cheap material. Product is WAY overpriced.,0
2,The fit isn't anything like the photo.  If you have big breasts this is definitely not for you.,0
2,This looked nice but it is not safe. On two occasions I found that the band unclasped itself with minimum effort. The last straw for me was when my watch fell of my wrist. Luckily it was in my backyard but could‚Äôve easily been anywhere. Do not recommend this band because it doesn‚Äôt stay secure on your wrist.,0
5,Cute and just as expected! Should include a gray color!!,1
5,Super cute with fast shipping! Great buy :),1
1,Band broke in less than a week,0
1,Terrible watch. The watch band came apart after 2 days and was unfixable.,0
1,I returned this dress because it did not look good on me. I returned it at a Kohls location and I still have not gotten my refund that was issued on April 28th.,0
3,Was too small but it look great and fit someone who was size 0 great i order size 2,0
5,"These are nice and comfy. I know they are mens; however my son and husbands thighs are muscled and thicker than mine and they hate the skinny look. The material is cotton, but the inside is like a cotton ball and soft. There are 3 deep pockets, which are a plus. I got the mens medium for a perfect fit and a large for a lil baggy fit. I can see me in these a lot this fall and winter. I received a discount for my unbiased opinion.",1
3,The bottom is very cheeky... Beware if you have any kind of behind,0
4,Fast shipping. Good quality. The picture doesn't do them justice. Very pretty!,1
1,I really expected a better quality than what‚Äôs was sent.  Cheap polyester material and runs larger than expected.  This was to be given as a gift but I found a better quality one on Etsy justness had to give late.  This is trash and I wouldn‚Äôt pay $1 for it had I known it was nothin like the picture,0
5,Very nice simple dress with a pattern that makes you look slim!,1
1,Does not hold onto the ear at all.,0
3,"I actually loved this product but it was way too short. I'm 5'4"" and I ordered a small. It fit in every way but just want long enough. Short legs? Order!",0
3,I loved the fit everywhere but the chest.  It is so beautiful but would not button up.,0
3,Its really shinny lol,0
5,Just as pictured! Nice quality! Exactly what I wanted.  Looks great!,1
4,"Most supportive strapless bra I have ever had. The elastic in the band is a little tight, but the hold is amazing.",1
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!! My daughter was super happy! They came in perfect!  Highly recommend other mommas to buy these rain boots!,1
2,"Dingy manufacturing, too loose around the chest, zero nipple coverage.",0
1,"I purchased this for my 5 year old grandson, he could not wear it the necklace was is not adjustable, he was soooooo disappointed and so was I.",0
3,Pearl too large,0
4,Sized down as recommended and they fit perfectly,1
2,Was not impressed. The material felt cheap and it was too big.,0
5,They met my needs and eyes are so good,1
1,"after waiting more than a month, bad quality, small hole in chest. you get what you pay for. crap",0
4,"A little thin, a little itchy, a little shorter than expected but I enjoy it enough to keep it. I was hoping to wear it with leggings but not long enough.",1
4,"Very cute, bought as a gift for my mother so i was a bit disappointed that one of the poles was bent in the bag they sent it in. We were able to fix and she loves them.",1
3,Seems to made very well and looks high quality but it‚Äôs too small to fit my ear. Also disappointed that it only works on the left side - I would‚Äôve preferred it on my right.,0
4,"Perfect size, lots of pockets.",1
5,"I lose them, scratch them, and go through more than the average person. Can‚Äôt spend a lot. These are my favorites of the last six styles...ordering more now. I like the brown lenses.",1
5,Just same as the picture.,1
3,"Nice Shirt, Nice Color, Very Soft, Over Priced & Pilled On The First Wash! Found the same shirt from another seller for $5.00 cheaper! Pillled on the first wash, Should I have turned inside out to wash? My fault or just the material! IDK Fits well & Fast shipping!",0
4,"The plastic sizing piece on the back of the cap, one side wasn't attached. Easy to fix with some good glue. The cap has a worn look, and is VERY soft. No stiffness at all. But when I took the plastic wrapped cap out of the mailer, I noticed immediately, the unattached strap. That makes me think someone else must have known. Maybe  ü§î a Hater?",1
3,Returned,0
1,please don't waste your money on this.  The dress looks nothing like the pictures and the material is super cheap.,0
5,These are my favorite shorts ever!  I got other harem shorts and these were more<br />Of the perfect fit!!,1
2,Its card slots were pretty tight,0
3,It flares out on the sides a bit too much and I look thicker than I am. It's cute but more Halloween styled.,0
1,Fell apart first time I put it on,0
5,"Out of the box they appear way too small. They looked like they‚Äôre made for my 5 foot tall wife. But they have spandex in them and a lot of stretch. I ordered size Medium-Large and they‚Äôre perfect for my shoe size (8.5). They are extremely comfortable. I like that they stop just above my ankle, which is where my normal socks settle when they slide down my leg. There‚Äôs no settling w these socks. You can feel the softness of the cashmere but they‚Äôre not hot like my other 100% cashmere socks. They may be my new favorite dress/work socks. Don‚Äôt know about longevity or what happens when you wash them‚Äîbut 5 pairs for this price is inexpensive. This was a good buy‚Äîhappy w purchase.",1
4,Just received these in the mail today (1-14-15) ordered (1-10-15) and I absolutely love love love so far no complaints,1
5,Love it. Exactly what I wanted,1
5,Like it.,1
1,Turned color and made neck green,0
2,"The wallet was very pretty and did look just like the picture, but the odor was so bad I had to return it.  It smelled toxic.  I even left it out for a couple of days but the smell was still very strong.  What is it made out of?  Sorry, I wanted to like it.",0
5,"I was really surprised of the quality of these earrings and fell in love as soon as I put them on. They are very lightweight and the coloring is perfect - natural brown and creamy tan. The metal post is strong, not the least bit flimsy and think it will last for a long time. They look great on from the front as well and are same level of stylishness I'd find in other earrings at name brand stores.",1
5,Love it!,1
5,"I love these bras!  There is plenty of support and they fit perfectly, true to size. I first ordered a 2-pack and after wearing one the first day, I ordered a 4 pack. I got rid of all my other bras because these are super soft, lightweight, breathable and they fit perfectly. The pads are securely in place permanently. I have washed a couple of them and they are no different after washing and drying! I recommend these bras if you want support, no show nipple coverage, but very lightweight and breathable in super hot humid weather!!",1
1,It doesn't stay connected it's a hook that wasn't thought if well,0
5,"What can I say, the jacket looks amazing and fits amazing. I personally much rather the slim fit than the baggy and savvy bomber jackets.",1
1,"Had to return them, as they were broken when I received them",0
5,Perfect for our wedding invites! Thanks!,1
4,"Probably won't order again, but they will do for now.  I ordered it for swimsuit but it has more of a workout/runner's feel to me.",1
3,"So this hat is cute and I wanted a satin lining.  It looks like it's supposed to fit tight to your head but it was really big on me.  If I pulled it all the way down to fit the top the top of my head, it would cover my eyes lol.  If I tried to fold it up more the satin lining would show and the pattern would be off and look weird.  I ended up returning it.",0
3,"I really liked the blouse. It ran small so it did not fit. However, it made a nice gift fir NY friend who loved it and I was happy that I was able to give it to her instead of having to return it. It ran about a size smaller than the actual size.",0
4,"The sizing is off. Bought a medium cos it said a medium fits US 10. I am a size 8... 34, 30, 42"". It was snug. I can get away with it if I lose 5lbs which I plan on so I will keep it cos it's cute",1
2,Runs very large!! Not much breast support.,0
5,excelente,1
1,It doesn't look like the picture. I expected it to actually be gold. It is not.,0
5,I got so many compliments on it!,1
4,"This is a lovely bracelet with a unique look about it.  The stones are really pretty and show quite nicely, and the corded black band looks great against the gold wings with the blue stone.  It easy to open wide enough to get your hand through but I had to use my teeth and other hand to tighten it up enough so it wouldn't fall off.  And I agree with the other reviewers about the wing not laying flat enough.  But it's still a very pretty bracelet and I look forward to wearing it.",1
4,will put some small flowers and leaves on it in fall colors on it for fun.,1
1,"The picture is pretty but it is a picture under resin.  It does not have the ""3D"" effect of what a true Steampunk clock usually has which is gears layered under the resin.  Nope just a picture.  One other note, there was a chain but only about 3 inches with no clasp.  There was no 18 in chain but it is really cheap.",0
5,Love this product,1
5,I no sooner place my order and the pin arrived.  This is for a Christmas gift and I know they will be very happy with it.,1
4,"this shirt is fantastically well printed, extremely light weight (which is important in hot muggy climates) and well constructed. The only reason I give four and not five stars, is it's not as LONG as I would have presumed it to be.  I ordered an XXL, presuming the &#34;XX&#34; also stood for extra length not just extra Girth, so now I'm stuck with a Shirt that is perfect in every way, except its too darn short for me (6'4&#34; 250lb).  Still all in all, I love the colors and the fabric!",1
5,Exactly what I thought it would be,1
3,"The description indicated 5 sets - I only received 4 sets, there were no black cats.  And the ""Wizard Hats"" are really cowboy hats. The sets I received are cute but I was planning to wear the black cat earrings so I was disappointed.",0
5,"I absolutely love this nightshirt! It is super soft and comfortable. I ordered an XXL and am about 5'5&#34; and this comes just a tad above the knees . I actually bought this as a maternity/nursing shirt for the hospital stay and the v-neck is low enough to where nursing wont be a problem! I will definitely be buying these in more colors. The tag does say &#34;Medium&#34;, but when you are selecting the size you want, it does say &#34;XXL&#34; is a &#34;M&#34;. I am 36 weeks right now and by no means petite... this is bulky enough but not to the point where it looks like you're wearing a damn muu muu.. enjoy!",1
5,Yes just what I wanted thang you  nice job,1
4,This is worth of every penny! can accommodate more clothes than expected. Its cheap compared to Samsonite Tote a ton bag. Good part of this duffle bag is Zip does not comes completely down unlike Samsonite Tote-a- ton. thumbs up!,1
4,I loved the fabric of this bohemian casual dress. I think that when you go out you have to wear a camisole underneath though because the opening is very very low and revealing with the 2 ties. The medium fit fairly well but a little tight in the bodice so if I purchased this dress again I would like a large,1
3,I wanted to live this dress but it was ill fitting on my and terribly unflattering. I'm pear shaped and would not recommend it for pear shaped women. Cute fabric and design though.,0
5,"This was a gift to my husband.  He was delighted with the watch.  Easy to read, has a light, is water-resistant, and is not expensive.",1
5,worked great and much more economical then OEM,1

2,"I needed an electronic travel organizer, thought this would work. it is basically a piece of cardboard with flex straps, trying to add all my gadgets didn't work because of the various sizes of the straps.  Ended up buying a travel bag organizer that works and covers all my gadgets.",0
3,Didn't fit as comfortable as a HJC helmet.  For short 10 min rides it's fine for the money.,0
5,I‚Äôm always ordering this and just bought more as a student of the Kabbalah,1

2,"I just recently moved to Florida and need to get a whole new wardrobe. So I bought a lot of summer dress that have spaghetti straps, which you need to wear a strapless bra for. So I was very excited to try the Sexy Women's Ultralite Backless Strapless Silicone Push-Up Reusable Bra by Liswic. Sadly, that excitement quickly vanished once I tried the actual bra. First I believe that it was too big. I went off of their size chart for my size and I believe I should have purchased the small/medium not the large/xlarge. Secondly it was extremely hard to remove the plastic from the reusable bra. I kept sticking to the actual bra when I tried to remove the clear plastic cover. Next I couldn‚Äôt get the bra to stay on. The adhesive wasn‚Äôt strong enough and was pulling away from my breast. It created a weird gap. Lastly, removing it was awful. It actually HURTS to pull it away from your skin. I am not a fan at all of the reusable adhesive bra and will go back to the standard strapless bra.<br /><br />I did receive this product at discounted/free price for my review. The views here are entirely mine and based on my own experience. I hope my review was helpful to you.",0
2,"I ordered these for my brother's wedding. My mom and I are both wearing different size heels, and when we measured them for sizes according to the websites instructions, we were happy to find that my heels were the Super Skinny size and hers were the Xtra Small... and they both came in 1 pack. They arrived today, and I just tried them on the shoes. Based on the measurements, they should have fit. Unfortunately, the Super Skinny was way too small for my heel... it didn't even go in. However, the XS fit just fine. Needless to say, XS didn't even come close to fitting on the heel of her shoe, even though we measured according to the instructions. I just ordered another pack, a size up... and that's fine, they'll get here in time for the wedding... but it's frustrating because we measured correctly and the product came up short.",0

1,Sleeves to short,0
5,"Absolutely LOVE this dress. I wear it all the time. It's honestly my favorite (and also the cheapest) dress I've ever owned. It is so flattering, even if you're a curvy lady like myself (5'2&#34;  160lbs  36D). Also, it's extremely comfortable. I could go on and on... I love it.",1

4,Very nice but it does shrink a little in the wash.,1
5,"I have enjoyed the time I have sat admiring my shower curtain. Nowadays, I spent quite a while each day enjoying the view. Oh, and the Red Stripe I consume also helps the ambience.",1
5,I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband. I like the look very much! He is saying it is warm and comfortable.,1
1,THESE GLASSAS ARE NOT THE SAME SHADE AS THE PICTURE. THEY ARE CLEAR WITH A HINT OF TINT. I DO NOT LIKE THESE GLASSES AT ALL. THE POINT FOR SUNGLASSES IS TO WEAR WHEN THE SUN IS OUT AND MY EYES STILL WERE SQUENTING TODAY WHEN THE SUN WAS OUT,0
4,Baggy and goes off the shoulder easily but it‚Äôs super cute. Wear a bralette under it!,1
4,"The jacket is nice but could be longer. It is more square and definitely doesn't have the shape that is pictured. It's warm and nice though I just wish it was longer. I am 5'2&#34; and 130lbs I got a medium, fits nice but if you want to wear a hoodie or thickn sweater under it I would go a size up.",1
1,"I bought this bra according to the size.  I was very excited when purchasing but very disappointed when I tried it on. Too small.  The elastic lace with hooks that is supposed to provide lift and support, constantly slides out of place and bunches under the breast.  I loved the look.  I gave it to my daughter. Nice but too small.",0

5,Beautiful bag.  I love the color inside and out.  Very functional and cute,1
3,"So, I was extremely excited to get these in the mail, but once I compared them to my regular plugs, these felt a lot smaller. Not only are they shorter, but the flare is smaller. As someone who wanted to stretch my ear, and loved going up in sizes, these make me feel as if I've gone down in size.  For that, I would rate these a 3.",0
5,"Very cute dress, fits well, looks great.  Can  be dressed up or down.",1
3,Good material but it had broken with in 2 weeks.,0
5,"I use this bag everyday as my work bag to and from teaching. It holds all the books and papers I need, plus the inside pockets are great for pencils and markers. I do not use the outside pockets. I love the option to use the shoulder straps or longer cross body strap. I also really like the hot pink interior as it makes finding things much easier than a darker interior. When I travel the rear double zipper works great to hold this bag over the handle of a carry on suitcase.",1
5,quality was better than expected . i love the texture and color will be buying all colors,1
1,"I ordered my size and I can't even get it on, its like 5 times smaller than what it should be, so I had to give it away. I'm not sending it back cause it took over a month to get it. I don't suggest ordering this shirt or any others like it.",0

1,"Logo print is great, but the design of the mask is incorrect. Difficult to breathing.",0
2,"The dress is super cute. After reading the reviews on size I though getting the biggest size will give me a little play, dress was a little more snug than I‚Äôd like. & there‚Äôs NO belt. Dress has belt loops with NO belt. The bottom of the dress is more see thru than I‚Äôd like. You have to wear a slip",0
3,"They're swim shorts not regular shorts. The fabric is swimmers fabric, very thin and no lining.",0
5,Great quality for the price. Typically I do buy more expensive socks but I was running low and figured I‚Äôd just grab some off of amazon. They‚Äôve made it through about 10 washes and still seem to be in good condition and the color hasn‚Äôt faded too much.,1
3,It‚Äôs cute. Nothing special. Chain a little thicker than I‚Äôd have thought it would be.,0
1,This product is not knitted and not as shown in picture what so ever... I returned it,0
3,"First, this is a very pretty necklace. But it is poorly made. The clasp holding the pendant fell apart the first day.",0
2,"It's a love/hate relationship. The shorts themselves are lovely and exactly what I was looking for: lightweight, cool, breathable and very comfortable. I live in a warm tropical climate and these are perfect. However the craftsmanship is extremely poor. The threads were already unraveling when I received them and the front seam is coming apart, it's already opened 1&#34;. I'll sew them up so I can wear the shorts as long as possible, but it's probably not going to be a long-term relationship. If I could give separate ratings, it would be 5-stars for the material and design but 1 star for the craftsmanship. Buyer beware.",0
1,"runs at least 2 sizes smaller, can see thru your bra",0
1,Must be from China . Sizing way off . 3x felt like a Size small. I'd show you the video of me trying it on but Amazon would flag me for indecent exposure because the bra covered nothing,0
2,"The fabric is so thin, that the first time I wore them they ripped!",0
2,This was very poorly made but it served the purpose after I Trimmed threads and pressed it,0
5,"I used this headpiece to accessorize a 1920's style dress I wore for my reception. It was hard to keep it in the middle with all the walking and dancing, but a few bobby pins strategically placed really helped! Lovely piece. Now I want more!",1

5,Best water shoes for kids hands down. First pair lasted over 1 yr with a 3/4 year old and could probably take another year or more :),1
1,"**Update** I had to send back 2 pairs of these frames because the temple snapped off after a few days of my child wearing them. He was NOT rough with them. I was then out the cost of the lenses I had made to fit in these frames. Save yourself the money and time wasted and just buy miraflex; they don't break.<br /><br />This review is for the toddler size 2-4y. These fit my toddler (2) better than miraflex. Did not give them 5 stars only because the elastic band keeps pulling a thread and that's annoying. Otherwise they're great! And he has a big head, like 90%.",0
5,"Does what it‚Äôs supposed to, works incredibly well. Yes the power cord aren‚Äôt in the best position, but I‚Äôm not sure where else it could logically go...use care when inserting and removing from shoes.",1

5,"We received a wide variety of socks in all colors and styles. Sizes ranged too, but my daughter is on the beginning of the size bracket. I would not advise anyone to purchase these sets if your child is toward the end of the size bracket. There is a range of sizes. For the price, it is a great deal. I would say that we did receive quite a few pink/girlier pairs, but I have a daughter. We also received a few cute dump truck prints (which she loved too) and several gender-neutral options. For the price, it is a great buy.",1

3,I had to take the shirt to a tailor to get it adjusted. Fits way too big! And the color starts to dull after a few washes.,0
4,"Bought this for my daughters birthday party. It's a very pretty dress and made well! My only issue is that it's very ""roomy"" in the chest area- which is something I wasn't wanting in a little girls dress. It was too late to return or to buy another in a smaller size.",1
5,This is very pretty lace!  I hope to order more colors soon.,1
1,The material was so thin you could see my freckles through it...it was like papyrus paper...and it was more like light tan/off white...not pure white like the pictures showed!!,0
5,This bag is lovely.  I am very picky about the purses I carry and this one fits the bill.  It has sufficient storage pockets inside and is very handy with the extra handle.  The bag itself is very well made and will hold up for a long time.  Great purchase!,1
2,"Poor quality clothing.  After I washed them on gentle using gentle detergent, the length shrank quite a bit and the elastic waste is very uncomfortable, the fabric is very rough as well. Won't buy gain.",0

2,I loved these at first but they‚Äôre already falling apart at the seams. Not even worth the hassle or cost of returning them.,0
5,Gorgeous,1

2,"I purchased this item seeing the affordable price for three piece combo set, but the item arrive with only one piece.",0
5,I purchased this as a gift. I personally love it and wish it came in more colors. If I could keep it I would.,1
2,"Cheap, not tunic length, shapeless",0
5,Pants length is perfect they are like the 7/8 length style. They fit great at your waist and don‚Äôt fall down when you bend over or squat down. They are soft and comfortable. I love these pants.,1
2,Colors are cute.  Sized way too small.  I ordered a large I typically wear a medium.  My b cup ladies fall out the bottom of the top and the leg holes in the bottoms cut into my legs.  Too bad it would be cute if it was cut properly.,0
2,"Was too small and the color came in beige.  Nice coat, but not what I was expecting.",0
5,They are very beautiful. I have only had it for a few days and i enjoy wearing it. It does fit a bit too big on me and my boyfriend but it can connect on the other part of the chain. But it is harder to put it on that way. Nonetheless i am pleased with the product.,1
5,Great looking and soft.,1
5,Gf love it,1
2,The colors of the shorts were not as pictured. The red was a washed out red and the ‚Äúgray‚Äù was actually a camo green shade. One pair  of shorts was a smaller size than the other 2. Not sure how well they will hold up to washing and wearing. Would not recommend purchasing them.,0

5,cute,1
4,"This is a gorgeous necklace! Beautiful stones, well set and stunning. A real statement necklace!  I have one little issue with the clasp. It's brassy and flimsy. I'll replace it myself with a sturdier version from the craft store.",1
2,"Too late to return. If you purchase them, try them on when you get them. I didn't and now I'm stuck with them. The same sizes can vary up to 2 inches on the waist line. One pair might fit well, while the next one is too big or small.",0
2,I had my doubts that it would be long enough before I bought it and it definitely was. Super unbecoming on and the flowers were super blurry which I had semi expected. But it was just not good all around not what it looked like online.,0
5,Beautiful. I love it .,1
5,"It took many weeks to arrive,but product fits on face comfortably,easy to adjust straps and has compartment for filter which gives extra protection",1
4,"Nice goggles.  Finally got to a poo, to try them.  They are indeed watertight, although for me, they seem a bit uncomfortable around the bridge of the nose.  Could be me -- could be the goggles.",1

5,"Beautiful purse. Still in great shape after a year, definitely worth the money!",1
2,I love the look BUT the metal turned/tarnished the first time I wore it.,0
4,"Awesome prints! Soft material and well constructed. I love these and have bought six pair to wear as kind of stylish long-johns layered under ripped jeans. Very cool look. I love them VERY much, so it pains me to take away a star, but they should be more color fast. They're starting to fade a bit and I've only washed them about five times.",1
4,Was more of a red than wine color. Fit was good and find to be very comfortable.,1
5,"after a car trip, where i found myself needing to switch back and forth from sunglasses to readers (or my weird piggy backing style of wearing both - although temporarily) i thought there must be a better, and affordable way.  i have had some difficulty with the clear division between the plain lense, and the reader, but with some adjustment (and a little nausea along the way) am wondering why i did not think to check amazon sooner.  these are the amber tinted lenses.  if you have a newer car with tinting, these should be sufficient.  if you have a &#34;classic&#34; or older model, are on foot, etc., you might want a darker lense.",1
3,Thought I would love it but its a bit cheap looking imo,0
4,"The length, fit and material of these shorts are awesome.  I am 5'10, about 200 lbs and a Large fit me great.  It's in the name and description but wasn't really expecting the liner.. and still on the fence with them.  With gym shorts, I tend to use them a few times before washing them, with the liner in this thing, they can obviously get a little funky after one wear so thats not going to work.  Other than that, they are great shorts and really good for riding a bike, spin or anything you use shorts for.<br /><br />**Almost forgot got the red, white and blue ones also and they turned a few items they were washed with pink from bleeding in the wash... not cool, so be advised.",1

5,I have only tried on the sunglasses and haven't had a chance to use them when driving yet.  I did like the way they fit pretty well over my regular glasses but too short a time to know any more yet.,1
3,Very attractive. Case is great!  Can't beat the glasses for the price!,0
5,"Very soft and warm, not itchy like I experience with other wool products.",1
5,My daughter loved this came quick well packaged and my daughters my heart it was so nice for her to get this the color is pretty and delicate aww it is perfect for any little princess,1

4,Very pretty and nice material. A bit on the small side.  Would order one size up.,1
2,It is cute and comfy but too short. I'm sure it is perfect for some people (specifically younger and thinner people). I still wear it around the house because it is comfortable.,0
3,They feel and look more like spanks. You can see through them very easily.  The waste was comfortable. I‚Äôll wear them under clothes instead of as yoga pants.,0

2,"I was initially very impressed with this watch - it has a fashionable big face with an unusual interesting look. I thought for around $20 it was quite the steal. I also really liked the mesh metal band and the belt like closure instead of the typical clasp.<br /><br />However, after several uses, the metal coating on the face started to look discolored and looked like it was peeling off in some places.

1,Flimsy material<br /><br />Must be made in China bc the size I ordered was soooo too small!,0
5,Very warm and true to size.  I‚Äôm 140 pounds purchased a medium.,1
5,I'm extremely pleased with the suana suit. Very well worth the price. Material is thick and durable,1
4,I bought this as a gift and the individual I gave it to absolutely loved it!  I wouldn't have paid much more for it but I thought for the price it was definitely worth it.,1
5,"I appreciate the quality.  One of the two arrived damaged and the lid piece was bent over like the corner of a piece of paper. So now I have an obvious line from the crease.  But, overall, these are nice to have and I definitely show up with the nicest card holder at any meeting.",1
2,"Printing was off center.  My son still really like to be sure, but I was definitely disappointed.",0
1,Item was broken when I received it. Missing parts.,0
5,"Perfect summer purse! Great for people who don‚Äôt carry around too much. I fit a 17 oz water bottle, glasses, a wallet, sunglasses, & a small paperback book. Sunflowers are faded yellow.  See photo against very bright yellow pillowcases.",1
1,"I had high hopes for this necklace, but what I received was a defective item with no redeeming qualities that I could find:<br /><br />- when I took it out of the package, the chain broke from the vine section befor I even had the chance to try it on<br />- the connection that broke was so delicate that there was no way I could have done a reasonable repair job<br />- central vine section looks cheap<br />- garnets appear dull<br />- necklace was in a small plastic bag stuffed into a box -- I didn't purchase it as a gift, but had I done so, I would have been embarrassed by the packaging alone<br /><br />Perhaps obviously, I'm returning the necklace for a refund.",0
5,"I ordered this waitress costume for use in a play.  The actress wearing it looked good in it.  Definitely looked like a waitress.  I read in other reviews that it ran a size small, so I ordered a size up - figuring worse case scenario, we could take it in.  It was fine though.  So, it does run a size small.  Makes a great costume for a play or for a costume party.",1
1,Had to return. Totally ripped apart after wearing for 2 days,0
1,"The position of the pockets makes your butt HUGE and that‚Äôs without putting anything in them , poor quality",0
3,"Inside of the shoe came out, the strap material is rubbing off. Only had these for a few months and they weren‚Äôt worn every day.",0
5,Perfect gift for my 6 year old grandson and my 34 year old son. Lol. They love fortnight.,1
5,Great fit sizing was right on.. I usually find Patty Boutik to run large but this fit perfect,1
5,Thick material so a slip isn‚Äôt needed which is nice with a white dress,1
3,Absolutely loved them until I washed them and they shrunk length wise.,0
1,I disliked that the band came apart on one side. Very poor.!!!,0
1,"Ordered a small and they were way too big. Scrunched at the knee and loose in the waist. For reference, I'm 5ft and 108lbs.",0
5,"bright and durable.  I'm always concerned that an aftermarket band will be  ""cheap"" and this is going on an expensive watch (in my world).  This is great!",1
5,I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and this hits me at the knee.  Great quality...fits perfect and is great for curvy women!,1
1,The threading was off and it ruined the entire navel ring!!!,0
5,The title pretty  ugh says it all. I‚Äôve had numerous foot surgeries over the years and have a difficult time finding shoes that are comfortable. Very pleased with these Easy Spirit  Elon‚Äôs!,1
5,Love the shoes.  Good quality and nice look for everyday shoes.  I should have ordered size 10 that I wear with good quality shoes.  My mistake but they will fit well with a thick pair of socks.  Saving them for colder weather. 5 Stars!  ~ Suzy,1
2,It was too big then I had make it smaller. When I tried to make it smaller the band broke so had to go buy another band and string it. Waste of money,0
1,Arrived with only one speaker working....and the one that did work sounded tinny and legend and cut out...I was gonna try an keep it with only the one speaker working but even that was CRAP...long story short...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,0
4,"Like the title says, good colors/pattern but the top layer is a bit rough due to the final stitching along the outsides of the entire strap. It is not really bothersome but is noticeable enough when picking up your guitar to put it on.",1
1,"These are very flimsy, I guess you get what you pay for. The lenses sometimes popped out while I was cleaning them. I had to throw them away because when you are looking at your iPhone screen, gas pump readout, or any sort of electronics there was a ton of weird distortion.",0
5,"Very comfortable, very nice fit. Perhaps a little big for a small, but the length of the shirt is perfect.",1
4,This tank is flattering on. I love it for the price!,1
1,"It came on time. It fit as expected. Which would've been great. Except, I had him try it on and when he took it off, the decal tore a bit and lifted from the t-shirt.  He only had it on for maybe two minutes.  Which was completely disappointing.",0
2,Wanted to love this but poorly made. Seams are crooked. Top gaps on one side. I would not recommend.,0
3,Too small,0
2,"Better than some other fitness brands on here, it's still pretty thin and runs small.  I usually wear a L or XL from UA and JS and the XL here was definitely too small on me.  Sad for its a great design.",0
5,Good product.,1
1,Very good design but does not fit better for a child which I gave it to my son because it does not fit an adult,0
5,Fast shipping. Cute accessory. I get a lot of compliments,1
2,"Very small. My daughter is a 10, knowing Asian sizing I ordered larger...still too small.",0
1,"Es una m√°scara sin forma y muy grande, no es para cabezas normales, por esto no cumple su funci√≥n de asustar, al contrario, da risa!",0
1,Poorly made and the print and color is horrible. Not even worth sending back. Money wasted,0
4,"This petticoat was very nice quality, however it was on the small size.",1
5,When I first received this I thought it was way too big but it fit perfectly. Very pleased with it!!,1
4,purchased as a xmas present,1
5,Been wearing it a month and love it! I work out with it and it never scratches,1
5,I love this hat!!,1
5,"Not sure what to expect. Have had super sensitive ears, never been able to wear earrings without pain and tried piercing again  (3rd times a charm?) after aged 60. Can I just say, Wow? I wore these all day with no irritation. I was worried that they might be heavy, but they are not. And my daughter-in-laws both said they were super cute. So, bonus! I'm in love.",1
2,"I recently bought two packages of this headbands and the animal print ones are ok, so I kept those, but the glitter ones were horrible, look very cheap and kind of ugly,  like a kindergarten kid glued the glitter in, the fact that they are adjustable is great though because they do stay in, but i guess you have to watch which ones you get, i will buy again but definitely not the ones with glitter..",0
1,I hand washed this dress once in cold water / hang dry and it shrunk.  I had to wear it to bed to hope that it would stretch back out and it did.  I washed it the second time and it shrunk again. Too much drama and effort/,0
5,Very nice,1
5,"Just like other reviews said, one of my favorite dresses ever!  I have a little mom-pooch and it‚Äôs flattering!  I added a wide black belt and wore it to our semi-formal Christmas work party.  Lots of compliments and pockets are a serious bonus!!!",1
3,Very short for a xxl,0
2,"I usually am borderline between medium and large but when the reviews said to order a size up, I got the XL just in case. I couldn‚Äôt even pull the skirt up over my thighs... I had to give the skirt to my mom who is usually maybe a size 4 at the most. The inside of the skirt said XL size 8 and it fits her well. I gave it two stars because it‚Äôs still cute.",0
1,returned - it was like a kid's toy,0
5,These are nice glasses for the price. They wrap and fit my face nicely.  I am not sure of the clarity of the polarized lens just yet-but they seem to be of good quality.,1
2,Ordered a size 5 recieved a size 7. It looks a million times better in the picture than real life.  I needed a cheap stand in for my wedding band for pictures while my it was being resized so I ordered this. It was too cheap. I should've just waited or paid more for a better quality ring.,0
2,I like the material on the inside I think it's good for sweating I don't get why the stomach is wider than the top or bottom I don't know exactly which is which because one side is small the center is the widest and the other side is a little bit bigger than the one side I am built like an hourglass I don't understand the concept on this peace making the waist smaller if the waist is so much larger than the hip and rib cage my body goes the opposite way and I thought that was the point of a waist trainer was to make your waist smaller and the side hem tore the second day I wore it.,0
1,Bad watch,0
5,Small,1
5,Good good good good good,1
3,"It was to shiny for my taste. Looked a little cheap, and it come flatten, so u have to stuff it to get the shape,",0
2,Bra did not fit well for a plus sized person.  Bra cups had breasts standing at full attention and not a soft view.  My full figure flowed out of the bra and was unattractive.  I returned it.,0
1,"Terrible. I don't have a big head at all. The neck hole is small. Really tight around the neck if you can get it over your head. Sizing is way off. Runs really small. The empire waist rests on the bust if you are larger busted. Plus, it's cheap material. It will pill. Don't waste your money.",0
3,"On the bright side, these pads did fit over the existing hard as rock nose pads on my Ray-Ban eyeglasses, which did make them more comfortable. On the less bright side, they added far too much bulk to my nose pads. So much so that my progressive lenses were pushed up to a level that made them unusable for me. I had to write them off as no good for me and order a different solution.",0
1,"Looks fancy but not good for wearing, especially if you need to resize the band.  It cannot be resized to fit everyone by professionals",0
5,"Fits perfect, light weight for summer and dry quickly.",1
5,I was skeptical of buying these because I did not see a size chart even though I referred to her old pair of socks I was hoping they were adult and they were!<br />I bought a small for my 14 year old who is a size 9 women in Nike cleats and they fit her<br />She does like them snug<br />Also love the great price!,1
2,"I bought many of these bra liners, to help with perspiration. I was disappointed with the product. It was made of plain cotton material, and I found the item to be too long in length. I ordered according to my size, yet it was still too big. And this product was expensive. After my purchase I found the same item in a catalog for less than half the price.",0
2,"I bought these for my 13 year old son and his new swim season. I loved the seeming quality and he loved the style and function. He wore them for two practices and the bucket broke at the back strap. I don't think this was his rough use, but rather a design flaw. The plastic at the buckle seems to fragile and brittle for its function.",0
5,"I love these leggings!!! I will only buy from them from now on. They fit great, they feel great and the price was great too. I can't say enough good things about them.",1
5,"The dress is really beautiful and not sure if it is cotton but the material is lovely.  Got the one with the big lemons on it and the background is off white and is really gorgeous.  After I got it and loved it so much, I went back to order another one but they did not have my size.  Do not hesitate to buy before your size is gone.  I usually take a 1X or 2x depending on the brand so got the 20W and it was just right.",1
3,definitely not for wearing as a regular bra; not very flattering under clothing but as some basic lingerie works great. My partner loved it and it comes with the underwear..bonus!,0
2,The fabric is very clingy and the pockets in the pants make for a very lumpy silhouette. I also found the rise a little low and the pants a little short.,0
1,"looks nothing like actual shirt, very disappointing considering i was very excited for this to come, and was met with a totally different product",0
3,"I purchased the gray merl because it was listed as being squat proof. You can see my underwear through them without even squatting.. so definitely not squat proof. Overall I do really like the color and even tho you can even see skin through it, since it‚Äôs not a solid color you can‚Äôt really tell. I was stuck between getting a small or a medium because I am a size 2-4 in jeans but have thicker thighs, so sometimes smalls don‚Äôt work for me. I ended up getting a small and they are tight but still comfortable to wear. They might‚Äôve not been so see through if I had gotten a medium, but I do like the compression. The pattern is flattering on the legs, but I think they fit odd in the butt. Again, could be because I got a small but felt like it gave me a flat pancake uni-butt. I like them, but won‚Äôt wear them for leg day. Might buy another color and size up!",0
5,I just received mines today it was perfect I always wanted a pair of these when I was a kid now I'm 48 just now getting them LOL thanks,1
3,"This dress is cute but I would size down! I thought a Medium would be fine since I‚Äôm normally a M/L but I could probably fit a Small! The color is also red, not burgundy.",0
2,Thin and really lose around my head,0
3,"Cute bracelet, but it was pretty small. Not sure this size would fit most women.",0
2,They run small! About a size to small! But the straps are wide so your foot slides out of them! My daughter can‚Äôt wear them!,0
5,ty,1
2,"The bottom portion fits (a bit snug but it's ok). The top portion is just awful. It's baggy on the underside and baggy on the top, and no matter hot hard I try, I can't tightly tie it around my neck or torso. It's going back.",0
2,Heavy glass frame should be lighter in weight needs a light glasses plastic holder. Lens is good<br />Thank you,0
1,"The glasses looked exactly as desired, but the frames were flimsy and generally of poor quality.  More important, the correction that was ordered was not delivered and the glasses were returned for a refund.",0
5,"beautiful colors and very durable, can't beat the price",1
5,"Fit well, comfortable",1
3,kind of heavy for my liking,0
5,Good fabric and is soo cute!!,1
3,Really pretty... but the rhinestones fall out and the chain broke. I didn't even get a chance to wear it!,0
1,Was not true to size. Will never buy again.,0
5,Love the fit of this dress. Got a lot of compliments on it.,1
1,"Have been purchasing this for years but now the product is not what it use to be, in order to save fabric they have made them tighter and shorter in length. i havent grown taller or fatter, but corporate greed has. Sad to see the current state of commerce in the west.",0
1,"They looked really cute, Only wore 2 times and already getting wore out on the toes. That‚Äôs why 1 star.",0
5,"I love the Sadie. It is made from quality leather and will last for years. I have another one that I've used for about ten years and am replacing it. I accidently had an open ball point pen in my purse and got ink all over it. If not for that, I'd still be using it for many more years.",1
3,"Overall they're nice!  The compression feels good; I did however notice, when I removed them at the end of the day, I had  breast cancer ribbons impressions on my legs.  They did not feel too small but I am wondering if they are.  Maybe they're made for very skinny legs.  I purchased Dr. Motion compression socks and they do not leave impressions.  :-)",0
4,"This fits my Note 10+ with Spigen slim armor case. It's a TIGHT fit on your controller. This really only has 1 usable angle. But as far as these things go, this one is perfectly servicable. My hands do get tired holding the controller with my phone attached, your mileage with this will vary.",1
5,plenty of room in soft interior with solid hard case.,1
3,"Pretty necklace but a little cheapie.  You get what you pay for, though.  Gets tangled really easy.",0
5,Love the t-shirt. It‚Äôs hilarious!! Arrived right on time - very nice quality.,1
3,Didn't like the material nor how it looked on me. I think better fit for tall slender females.,0
2,Ran small and very thin material. Sent back,0
4,"This suit is made of very good material. The breast pads are a bit too firm and boxy, so I removed them and it looks much better that way. I'm 5'7&#34;, weigh 150 and wear a 36B bra and a large fits nicely on me. If you have a long torso, order a size up like me and you shouldn't have any problems.",1
5,"These are part of Christmas stocking fillers, will see how they fit after holiday. I am sure that they will fit. I opened to check size and I am pretty confident stocking will fit .",1
3,"I only gave this 3 stars because the picture shows a pair, but you only get 1 piece not 2.  It is really super cute and I do love it, but it would be nice if you changed up the picture to show exactly what you receive.  The description does state that you only get one piece, but seriously why would you only want one?<br />I would have given this 5 stars if not for the fact that I had to order another one....",0
5,The earrings are nice for my granddaughter.,1
5,Excellent  quality.,1
2,Pretty but short and the size is smaller than what is written. I am 5'4 and this dress comes to my calfs. Disappointed,0
1,Way to small.  Tiny tiny tiny..,0
1,The lenses on these glasses appear to be distorted and give me a terrible headache. I am returning for a refund.,0
3,it's not too bad.  the uper part fits a little tight but not unconfortable.,0
3,Good quality but pockets are huge which makes dress stick out,0
2,Bulky and hard to maneuver button pressing.,0
1,"totally something different received ,nothing that even looks like this on the picture",0
5,Comfortable cute glasses,1
5,Super cute . Would highly recommend,1
2,I dont know if I got one that was not sewn right or what. But the hem above the lower band was so tight I could barely stetch it over to my arms to put it on.<br />2 stars given because I ordered the teal/gray and it matched like the picture.<br />Was a soft material tho. Maybe order up.,0
5,"I have been wearing Sorel Children/Youth boots for years. I wear a women‚Äôs size 8M and the Children/Youth size 7M was too large. I have a high arch and could not get into a Children/Youth 6M in this style otherwise I would reorder. Sorel‚Äôs are well made, look great, keep your feet warm and dry. They will last for years. I love the brand and am sorry I had to return this particular style.",1
1,Use the largest piece of this luggage for the first time last week it couldn't make it from Kansas City Missouri to Denver without a wheel breaking off and the luggage itself it is not repairable very very disappointed thank you,0
5,I could have probably gone down a size but I was very impressed with the quality of the material. I didn't expect it to be as nice as it was so I was very pleased with the fabric.,1
3,"This product fit very well and was comfortable for my daughter at her indoor swimming lessons, however, it frayed quickly from the chlorine, even with proper care and rinsing it right away after use.",0
5,I like the socks.,1
5,Sexy!!,1
1,They are awful looking. I couldn't use them because they looked like something the cat dragged in.,0
1,"I ordered 2 sets of these earrings as the photo was lovely.  When they arrived each set had a broken post on one earrings.  Had to return both pair.  Really wish I could have kept them as the color, sparkle, and design were lovely.",0
5,I tied it to make it crop top,1
2,This was not worth the money. It looked cheap felt cheap and ran small. That‚Äôs what I get for last minute shopping online.,0
5,"I've been wearing these for just over two months now and the shorts are great.  I like the way they look and the way they fit.  They're light and they shed moisture and debris well.  On the other hand, the included liner is not that great.  The liner itself is great but the foam padding in the liner is not that good in my opinion.  I've been using a Chinese brand sponeed padded cycling shorts for the past year and the padding in those shorts are light years better than the Troy Lee Designs liner which seems absurd.  I wish I could take the padding in the sponeed shorts and put them in the Troy Lee liner and then it would be perfect.  I will definitely buy more Troy Lee cycling shorts when I find them on sale but I won't bother with their liners.",1
5,very good and useful tool to have while sewing...,1
5,"Beautiful, comfortable, exactly as pictured - which I didn‚Äôt notice how long it was when I pictured. Need to have it hemmed up about 2-3 inches.",1
1,I received the wrong item. Item was returned.,0
5,Great looking and feeling,1
3,Some what small but it worked for my daughters costume as a cat,0
3,"I Developed a rash. At first I thought it was my new watch band I put these on with, but it was these metal pieces touching my skin that caused the reaction. Also after the first wear they started to tarnish.",0
1,"They fit - I bought them a size larger. I have worn them for less than a week, maybe a couple hours a day: one of the slippers is already falling apart. That says it all.",0
1,Terrible fit.,0
2,Disappointed with the fit. Have bought other coach shoes. in this size and those are the most comfortable shoes I own. The fit with these is very different from the others.,0
3,Material under my toes coming off with less than average wear. Sole not as soft/fluffy as I had hoped.,0
1,Everything was terrible about this.,0
3,I bought these as warm gloves for winter. I found them too thick and bulky and sent them back.,0
2,everything was fine except the backs were too small.  I don't need eleven more words to tell you the backs were to small,0
3,BROKE EASILY,0
1,Great looking glasses but so scratched that they look like they have been put through a cement mixer with rocks.<br /><br />Even tried the toothpaste method to get the scratches out but with VERY little luck.<br /><br />It's no wonder Amazon booted them from their seller listing.  Let's hear it for Amazon for taking care of their customers.,0
3,"This is definitely quite minimalist, thin and small.<br />But it's pretty much a money clip with a compartment put together with a elastic band for credit cards.<br />It's a bit awkward to use and quickly take cards out. If you don't have too many credit cards and like a money clip with something extra, this might be for you.",0
5,My daughter loves them! and now my glasses aren't constantly dirty or broke,1
3,Yellow rings light up nice. Poos are a little dim through the brown silicone.<br /><br />I bought 4 boxes and tested them all immediately. 8 were dead out of 96 rings and several more did not consistently switch on/off when pressed. Guess that's not terrible but QC could be better.,0
3,"Ok look, cheap quality. Wouldn't buy another one.",0
1,"I ordered one and it was gold in color, not sterling silver.  Requested an exchange and yup, the second one is also gold instead of sterling silver.  Sending it back too.  The chain seemed decent if only it was as described.",0
3,"The foot fits very well, a little tight around the leg to the point it leaves a mark.",0
4,The XL is more like a M but a great sweater.,1
1,The color not al all as shown and completely see through,0
5,Daughter was thrilled.,1
5,"The picture of this product doesn't do it justice.  My old soft briefcase was falling apart at the seams and I really needed something nice to carry all my paperwork in.  After what seemed like hours of searching, I came across this case.<br /><br />This case is perfect for the on-the-go gal who needs a beautiful bag to carry her stuff in.<br /><br />The main compartment appears large enough to fit in a slim laptop or several binders and folders worth of work.  In addition, there is a small, zip section with pockets in the main compartment - perfect for pens, cds, etc.  The bag also has two, large outer pockets on each side.  These are perfect to stash some of your work in progress.  This bag is sturdy and I expect it to last a long time.<br /><br />I would order this bag again, if and when this one wears out.",1
2,"Unfortunately, I wore holes in these within two weeks - one just outside the rubber bottom and one in the toe somehow, so these just aren't very durable. Had to throw them away today when the hole in the toe went all the way through.",0
2,"Waistband is a little scratchy on inside and my daughter didn't like nor want to wear them. Size was true I think. Overall, not the kind of comfy undies we were looking for.",0
5,The 3rd one I purchased for my 3rd belt---Yep---I love it!!,1
5,I love this swing dress. I get lots of compliments when  I wear it. I usually wear it with capri's.,1
4,"Accurately described, shipped promptly, good quality",1
5,"These boxer briefs are comfortable and nicely elasticized(not too night, not too lose).  The only question I have is one which will only be answered over time-how long will they last.  I have several designer boxer briefs that are comfortable and form fitting like these.  I am just hoping they hold up as well.",1
4,"It fits big so I am glad I ordered a size down. The red is darker than you would expect for Spiderman, which should be a bright red. I wish the inside of the good was black instead of white. The white looks a little strange with the black and red of the shirt. It isn't lined. Which I actually like. That way he won't get too hot. He is happy, so I'm going to keep it. I would send it back if it wasn't for my son insisting he wear it Halloween and there is no time to order anything else.",1
5,Fits great and is flattering.,1
5,"Love it! I got one of the original Zara blanket scarves as a gift and I fell in love with it. I wanted another but didn't want to pay that much, and I came across this one. It's exactly like my Zara one! It's even softer actually. Very happy with this purchase.",1
5,I love the pajama jeans.  They fit just right and I would order many more pair.,1
4,It's cute just took a while for delivery,1
5,My wife loves them,1
4,Great little suit. Good value for the price paid. The shirt was a bit cheap looking but all the other pieces were well-made.,1
1,I bought the four pack and only ended up receiving just 3. Never will purchase again.,0
1,Not at all like pictured.  Small turtle neck and not loose fitting.,0
5,"Just ditched the wallet after 25 years. Like everything about it. The looks, the functionality, and simplicity",1
5,Great dress. I ordered a 2nd one in another color.,1
3,"They fit weird. Maybe it's my face, maybe it's the glasses, not sure",0
1,Picture of the pants isn't accurate to what you receive. The pants were not the quality of linen and nor were they fabric and dimensions posted.,0
2,"First off, the color of this dress is fantastic.<br />But I'm returning this dress.<br />Love the color and I love high neckline dresses, but this is not the right cut.<br />For reference, I'm 5'2"" and usually a 38C, and can wear a size small in T-shirts, but usually go a size up because of my chest. In dresses with cuts like this, I generally have to go up. But this one doesn't fit well. The darts are very high on the chest, as if your b**bs (resubmitting this review because I'm not sure if it was rejected because I actually spelled out that word last time  - I sure hope that's not the case) are supposed to be both higher *and* wider. Even with an adhesive strapless bra, I couldn't get it to look right.<br />The extra fabric that hangs under the armholes is just not something I can work with, and it makes for strange pulls in the front and back -the way the fabric pulls in the back makes it look like I've got rolls of back fat. . .when it's actually the fabric. So it isn't flattering at all. I don't know if this is designed for someone with a smaller chest or what, but I would doubt it because then there'd be even *more* fabric at the armholes. Usually dresses like this look great on wispy women, but I think this is going to just hang off anyone and not look right.<br />I did try it without the strapless adhesive bra, by the way, just to see if I could get away with no bra with this darker color. Oh, that's a negative right there. So that definitely means you'll need something under the white or pink one.",0
5,"I ordered this dress for my best friends wedding which is a month away. We choose to use these dresses as ourbraidsmaid dresses. I love the dress, just wish it didn‚Äôt run big but then again it could just be that I‚Äôm tiny and the size is normal. It‚Äôs a beautiful dress and the color is good as well.",1
5,"These are frickin adorable. Don't know how well they will stand up to repeated washings - I avoid putting items like this in the dryer. Super small, I wear a M in underwear usually and the XL fits perfectly.",1
3,I love it but it is see thru,0
4,Very sheer and very loose under my arms. Cute with a tank underneath.,1
1,Paint job was messy. Doesn‚Äôt look like what I ordered & received it broken,0
5,Perfect fit - Adorable little heels for an adorable little girl - we love them!,1
5,"This is by far one of the best bracelets I've ever bought. The quality is there too, very nice indeed. The picture you see of the bracelet is what you get. Again, I can't emphasize this enough very nice bracelet just amazing.",1
3,"I feel that these yoga pants run a bit small. I am a pretty curvy girl and thought by buying a XXL they would be a little lose fitting. They are definitely tight and support all areas. I did read they were see thru, but wanted to give them a fair chance.  I have to wear black spandex shorts under the yoga pants.",0
5,"surprisingly comfortable to use even with my wider feet. snug, but just right. My foot size is US 8.5 and fits in a 42",1
1,The pendent was very rough and snagged my shirt!,0
5,Use as foot cover for bad circulation when sleeping. Feet do not feel cold and no compression to cut off circulation. Safely to walk in.,1
1,Strange fit. Big in certain areas yet small in others. Not a good look or feel.,0
3,I ordered 2 sizes larger than my normal size- I wear a 12-14 and I ordered a US 18- Fine in the shoulders and chest but too short and the sleeves around the wrist are so small (tight) there is no way I can roll them up the way the shirt is  made to be worn. But the sleeves were good at the upper arm which surprised me.,0
2,"Not very much support. This is probably a great bra for someone who wears a-c but for someone who wears a DD, the girls will fall right out... The padding had a very weird nipple space that makes it look like your nipples are popping through your shirt. Unfortunately I will be returning and continuing my search for a new bra.",0
1,The fringe pieces were coming apart after getting wet. Would not buy again.,0
5,My daughter was so happy to get this as a birthday present,1
5,Runs small. Had to order a full size up to get right fit.,1
1,cheap looking!,0
4,Mine were broken,1
5,As stated in other reviews these do run a bit small. I would say to order 1 size larger. But over all the shoes are great. But the 5 star is mainly for the seller street moda. My wife called to see about the return process and the person she talked with was by far and away the nicest and most helpful we have worked with in a very long time. The return was free and by our choice given a full refund on a gift card for easier access and more of a discount to their site. I highly recommend this site and loom forward to doing business with them in the future.,1
1,My dress was paperthin...poorly designed and worst of all...DIRTY.  I returned item.,0
4,Comfy n pretty,1
2,"Because of sizing variations and my need for a particular type of pockets, I ordered several different brands of yoga pants. These were the most expensive of the bunch by a long shot. And I upsized because I didn't want them to be quite as snug as yoga pants usually are. Thes were the ones I had the highest hopes for, but was quite disappointed. My 2XL is a lot more like a M or L. Way too small! The other 4 pairs are either slightly or way too big. Such a shame because it's hard to find ones with the shorter inseam (I'm 5'1"") and just the right pockets.  Nice job making me feel even fatter than I am, YogiPlace!!",0
5,They look really cute and sturdy,1
2,Poorly made,0
1,"TOO SMALL, IT LOOKS BIGGER IN PICTURES",0
3,I wish the lace was backwards. I think it would have looked better and the white material was too see through. But it fit very nicely,0
1,"This is the 3rd battery I've had to replace in 3 years-- they've perfected the 1-year warranty. This battery stopped charged a month after purchase and the company won't send a replacement until they receive the defective battery. These batteries aren't cheap, and they're definitely not worth the hassle!",0
4,"The beaded eyeglass holder is versatile (goes with just about everything). I was a bit worried about it being flimsy and too delicate, but so it is working out great. It is a bit long for my taste, but I am a short person.",1
4,Great fit. Love the material.,1
5,These bags are great! They hold so much yet they are so compact to carry in the smallest of purses. Definitely recommend!!,1
4,It's pretty and my iPhone 6s fits inside just right. Love the neutral color.,1
3,The plastic is way to long,0
2,"I have both remotes programmed to work to the same gate. The one remote works fine. The other, well, it doesn‚Äôt work more than it does. I‚Äôd just stick with the actually name brand-you get what you pay for.",0
3,"Order one size down, jeans are nice enough in he leg but holy crap the waist is large.",0
1,Too old fashioned and too heavy weight of earring causes earring to fall forward,0
4,Dress was very elegant. I would recommend sizing down if you are wanting a more fitted style.,1
5,Cute dress! Got lots of compliments with the dress itself and the color. This dress made me feel girly but maybe a little too much for me. But I would keep wearing the dress,1
2,"Dress is super cute, nice fabric, but barely covers your butt! Would not recommend for anyone with long legs",0
5,Leos always run small so I just ordered one size up. It fits great!  My daughter gets lots of compliments on the design!,1
1,This was the worst product I‚Äôve ever purchased! The so call sequins will literally cut your skin!,0
4,Very very beautiful I love these so much comfortable and affordable thank you,1
3,"Well-made nice looking shorts, but much smaller than anticipated. What I would consider almost midweight fabric - it is soft but not thin like thin pajama pants.  I think they are too thick to sleep in, but will be just fine for exercising, around the house, or a quick trip to the store. The XXL is small - maybe a large. If you need XXL, these will fit like Spanx.  Other products I have purchased from this brand have been soft and true to size.",0
1,I live in the South so only started wearing these in the last 2 months.  Although I washed them exactly as directed they have shrunk a full size and have split at the leg seam.  Had the same problem with another pair of striped ones.  Horrible waste of money.,0
2,Wallet was ok...but the zipper is not working that well and the leather is peeled a bit in a few spots. But I didn't either bother to request an even exchange.,0
4,"I love them. They were a little bigger than I expected, or maybe my ears are just smaller than I thought. üòÜ",1
2,I loved the material and the drawstrings around the waist and ankles. I expected them to shrink a bit and was careful when washing them. But I‚Äôve never had a garment shrink so much. I‚Äôll cut them off and use as shorts. So not a total waste.,0
3,"Disappointing.  I was really looking forward to this necklace. It came in an envelope, within the envelope was an ordinary box with a velvet presentation board.  The stone itself was in a separate bag as was the necklace. The actual size of the stone was very nice and it was as big as I had hoped. The setting was lovely, and it allowed the stone to catch a lot of light. The cut was very nice. The stone itself was rather disappointing. It was not the deep purple that I had seen and hoped for. It was a lighter color with shades of amber when the light hit it. There was no richness to the crystal.<br />The necklace was way too thin, and way too short for a stone in a setting this large, it was a complete misfit.<br />For this price I expected much more.",0
1,The ball earring size was ridiculously huge. Hung off my earlobes.,0
1,I didn't realize it was bathing suit material. The reason for a one star is because the fit is awful. It runs large...looks like a parachute from the side and the bottom from gathers and creates a puffy look..even when tucked into your pants/shorts it's just a terrible fit. I was disappointed and returned the item:(,0
1,What a piece of crap. Threw it out.,0
5,Very nice. All that was advertised.,1
5,"Best investment I've purchased in all my years. Used it less than 24 hours after receiving it. Took a bankroll of $135. Played $41 on 9 max $1 machine. Hit $450 cashed out with $414. Pulled my ticket, cashed it placed $200 in the safe. Went back to the same machine hit again and cashed out with $380. Added $300 to the safe. Now I had about a $300 bankroll and $500 to take home in less than 1 hour. Must buy for loved ones and friends who enjoy playing at the casinos but want to start winning.",1
3,It's ok,0
1,"I returned the item because it was poorly made, the sleeves itched and cut my arms and the torso was way too short!<br />I‚Äôm really disappointed because I had hoped to wear it during the holidays",0
4,Grand daughter likes it.,1
2,I Bought This band Because the Headline States &#34;PREMIUM LEATHER&#34; But What a disappointment If I Would've Known This Was NOT Real Leather I Never Would've Spend My Money On This Piece of Crap. I Recommend anyone NOT TO BUY This GARBAGE.,0
1,3x fits like a medium,0
2,"I absolutely LOVED this wallet but the strap broke off because the clasp split (it appears to be made of plastic rather than metal). I am extremely disappointed because this is the perfect size. It is large enough to hold my iPhone, keys, some loose change, cash and credit cards. The wristlet piece is critical if you want to use this instead of a purse so I cannot recommend for that reason!",0
5,Bought them for my grandson very cute with dinosauers,1
5,well made and looks great,1
1,"Very tiny, approx half the size of a dime and lacks sparkle.  Chain is dull too.  Gave it to my 10 yr old Grand-daughter to play with.",0
5,Love it! Can't wait to wear it.,1
3,They are way too long.,0
1,It is a misshapen sack that only gets worse after you wash it.,0
5,LOVE IT!!!,1
5,"Wear it anywhere, look great.and",1
1,Quality of this dress is awful. The dress that was sent to me had a HUGE hole in it. Not happy.,0
5,So cute,1
1,Way too small and the black is completely sheer,0
1,No sirve,0
3,I love the cut and the exposed shoulders but the material is a little thin and clingy.,0
3,Didn't care for the fit.,0
1,Too  big for my head. Fall off,0
1,"Extremely difficult to put onto collar.  If the spring on the back were just a little longer by about 1/4"" on each side it would have been very easy to put on the collar since it would give you something to push against to open the spring.  Having the spring on the back be the same length as the bar on the front it gives you nothing to push against.  It would be a very easy fix to make it a useful product, as it is designed and made right now, it is worthless.",0
5,Bought as a birthday gift and he has loved it.  Great purchase.,1
1,Very cheaply made.,0
5,S√∫per Nice. Confortibles.,1
5,"Love them! Wore them at a festival, lots of compliments. I collect sunglasses and these are a fantastic addition!! Super shiny!!",1
5,"This is a good quality hat. While there is no wire in the brim, it is easily molded and it stays the way you shape it!  One thing to note: the bow is on the left side when you wear the hat with the label in the back, which is where the adjustment for the band is. The adjustment strap will show slightly if you wear the bow off to the side.  I have not tried to pack it and hope it doesn‚Äôt get wrinkled up, but the quality is such that if it did, you could most likely steam the wrinkles out.",1
2,"It is a slim fit, I ordered a large, it seemed like a small",0
4,Order down a size. Otherwise nice sweater,1
5,Great product,1
2,"The bag seemed to be surprisingly good quality... at first. The canvas is sturdy, but the straps are worthless and tear out/apart right away. I ended up having to tie straps together in various configurations so I could continue to wear the bag like a backpack, but eventually it just became virtually unusable because all the straps were falling apart. The chrome looking clips that were supposed to hold the straps on snapped immediately. (I'm not sure what the clips are really made of- plastic? garbage?)<br /><br />Other than the straps being absolutely the worst, it's a decent bag. But if you can't hold it on your back because it falls apart... pretty worthless. That's what I get for spending 26 dollars on what looks like an expensive bag. Should've known- but I gambled and lost.",0
3,"I am not a dainty person by any means but thought this was much larger than the picture looked. I would have preferred something a little smaller in width, more feminine, and a bracelet that would look nice on a woman's wrist. I'll keep it but if I saw it first I wouldn't have purchased it.",0
4,Good deal.,1
3,Not small....same size as my original apple band ...,0
1,This dress felt like a halloween costume.,0
5,The clogs look so much better in person. My daughter loved the color and the heart holes around the toes. They fit true to size.,1
5,"Looks just like the photo! Love it! Gorgeous!  For reference in length, I am 5‚Äô7",1
5,So cute! Tons of compliments. Dress is a silky stretchy material. Bunny has an leopard print bow and glasses. Washed up well but does snag a little easier because of silky fabric. Not heavyweight fabric,1
5,Haven't taken it off since I took it out out of the box,1
3,They were very durable but unfortunately had to be returned... There was no way to charge the watch without taking it apart everytime ...,0
4,Not something i wear everyday. I bought them for the 4th. But other then that they're great.,1
5,GREAT GREAT PRODUCT. SUPERB VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY,1
3,"Nice gown, but runs very small.",0
5,This was exactly what I was looking for. The material is not too thin but not too thick. The cropped part sits perfectly above my bellybutton. Perfect for the gym.,1
5,"What a great surprise these are. The quality is good, love the thumb hole that allows the &#34;sleeve&#34; to cover and protect my hands.  The palms have a gripper area so things are easy to grasp and hold on to. I was so pleased that I bought two more as soon as I got the 1st pair. Happy! Haven't washed them yet so I'm hoping they hold up",1
5,"Perfect fit,  clean and fluffy with no stay hairs.  Great buy!",1
2,"I have a small head, and it was slightly bigger, but manageable. However, after washing it, it did not go back to size, it expanded, and list its elasticity. I will not purchase another.",0
5,Cute sweater!!,1
1,Came with one horn.,0
3,They serve the purpose,0
5,"I‚Äôm in between medium and large but went with large based by on reviews. Fits exactly how I wanted, loose but not so loose half my bra is showing!  This tank is cute!  Wore it with black leggings, and long beige cardigan and sandals. Super light and no peeking through the fabric or the.m buttons. Plan to wear it with cute ripped jeans and sandals as well. Glad I made the purchase!  I may get other colors.",1
1,It was very small,0
2,"These pants run very small. I would say size two sizes up, not just one. The fabric is soft, that is only plus.",0
4,Fits perfectly,1
2,Is ok,0
5,These are great and were a hit when opening at the birthday party because people got a kick out of them.,1
5,"These are lovely!  I don't usually write reviews, but I was quite impressed with these.  I bought them for a Mother's Day brunch out.  Not corsages, but something fun!",1
4,Would‚Äôve been a really nice product if I wasn‚Äôt sent the wrong size. I gave it to my daughter who could wear it. It fit true to size. It‚Äôs so cute.,1
5,Really nice quality material.,1
1,This was much larger than expected.  Thin fabric,0
5,"My mom normally wears a 6.5, but she tried these on in the store before I ordered them and she fit into a 7 better than the next smaller size, the 7 is perfect and she loves them!",1
5,love these glasses i got a big head and they fit perfect,1
3,Love it but tarnished fast,0
4,"Soft colors are so pretty.  It is a silky nylon type fabric reminiscent of head scarves from many years ago.  I have yet to wear it because I think scarves in the summer are just too hot, but I will get a lot of use out of this when it is a bit cooler.  The colors online are true.",1
5,"I always loved the aviator style glasses and didn't want to buy the more expensive brands.  These were surprisingly good quality build and the lens are very clear.  The glasses came with cleaning cloth, ear piece tool, soft and hard case.  You can't beat this deal!",1
5,Quality is far beyond what I paid for the item!  Was a gift but was tempted to keep it for myself.,1
4,Arch is very high but fixs well also very soft between toes,1
1,Looks cheap.  Haven‚Äôt worn it. Don‚Äôt think I ever will,0
5,Very impressed with quality of fabric. Looks as good as advertised on the pictures if not better. Kids love to wear their costumes every day. I would definitely recommend buying these.,1
3,It‚Äôs was a good product but it would not tighten because my wrist was to tiny,0
4,Good,1
5,"Very nice for the price, feels so so soft.",1
3,The material is too heavy and thick.  I am in the medical field and would not recommend this product to be used as medical compression socks.,0
5,Look great when I play tennis,1
1,This case broke at the wheels after one use?!?!  Super disappointed as it was not an inexpensive piece.  My trip was pretty much ruined..,0
5,My Granddaughter loved these !,1
5,Bought three sets for my three grandsons. They liked them and had a great time playing in them. They have Batman capes they put on with the pjs and played for hours.,1
5,"I like these gloves. The fingers are not stiff, makes it easy to hold onto rose pruning tool.",1
4,"The Realwe bracelet is unisex, meaning it will work for a woman or man. The links appear to be braided (wheat chain) and has a traditional clasp. It is 18k white gold-plated and did not irritate my skin. I noticed no redness or rashes (hypoallergenic). Overall, this is a decent bracelet that anyone would like.",1
2,Good but not my taste,0
5,This purse is absolute perfection! The brown color with the cinched side and gold chain! Chain has some weight to it too! It‚Äôs a small purse and perfect to bring essentials out with you!,1
5,Great Quality! Fits great!,1
5,Great,1
5,"This is a great necklace to have if your baby is at all like mine and likes to put everything (jewelry included) in his or her mouth. I am personally not a big fan of  big or clunky jewelry so this particular necklace was a good choice for me since it is smaller than most other silicone pendants (measuring 1.5"" by 1.5"").<br /><br />It is composed of pure silicone, appearing to be free from fillers, so the material is safe as well as easy to clean and sterilize. I tend to wash everything by hand but the description also states that the pendant is dishwasher safe and I see no reason why that would not be the case.<br /><br />The cord appears to be composed of black nylon and is comfortable against my skin. The cord also has a simple plastic clasp located in the back which is an upgrade from an old nursing necklace that I had which was simply tied in a knot. The cord on mine measures 30"" from clasp to clasp or 15"" from clasp to pendant. It is on the long side as far as necklaces tend to go but a good length to allow baby to manipulate the pendant without having to get up in your face. If you find it is a bit long for your taste you can shorten the cord fairly easily by sliding the clasp down on the cord where you'd like it to be, tying new knots and then cutting off the excess cord.<br /><br />If you are looking for a piece of jewelry that it both nice looking and also baby safe then I highly recommend looking into the silicone necklaces by Stella Mamma.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope this was helpful.",1
5,Cute backpack. Is was the right size.  Exactly what I wanted.  But zipper broke about 2 weeks of using it,1
4,Fit is good. I just wish they‚Äôd let you pick the 3 colors. Since they don‚Äôt to get one more color you normally get 2 of a color you already have multiple of‚Ä¶.I have enough black and grey.,1
4,Cute and very good purchase!,1
5,Liked the way it fit,1
2,This is a good watch band but there are no instructions and no way to adjust the band. That leaves me with a band that is way too big for me.,0
5,"Best coverage & fit.......size large fits perfectly on me as I'm 5""9, 140 pounds.  Don't look for anything else!!!",1
1,"Doesn't stay adhered at all, teeny tiny soles!",0
1,Absolutely terrible. Horrible quality,0
5,Soft fabric: comfortable and good sleepwear,1
4,Little heavy but totally cute,1
1,No it gave me a rash!! Not recommeneded,0
4,Looks cute on my daughter. The pockets stick out a little weird.,1
5,"Loved the fit, and style of the sandal.  Feet feel comfortable!",1
1,The zipper broke the first time I tried to zip it. Very poor quality. Avoid.,0
5,I just love the thing very good quality,1
5,Love it its super adorable,1
3,"I love the color and the size,  have received several complements on the watch band, but it seems to not be able to sit in the middle of my wrist where I want it.  It always slides away from me.",0
5,"Love this dress! Really stylish, cute, soft, and comfortable.  It has a nice flow to it and the little white belt gives it a nice touch.  The belt is pretty big (length wise) so I'm going to have to cut it down since it almost wraps around my waist twice.  Still, this dress is super cute!",1
1,Pants are not true to size. Couldnt even get them on. Couldnt return them but got partial credit from Amazon. Gave them away,0
5,My daughter loves it,1
2,I gave it two stars because I really like it and think it's cute but I can't dry it because it frays really bad.  Even when I take it out of the washer (I've only worn/washed it twice) the amount of strings I have to cut off is ridiculous.  Not sure how many more wears I'll get out of it before it completely disintegrates into a piece of cloth.,0
3,"Let me start by saying the colors are nice and as pictured and that's a positive, it also came fast but not as fast as was originally promised, it got here before I needed it to so I'm not to worried about that though. Now the negatives. The fabric is very stiff and has no stretch, my son who we ordered a 2-3T for is 41.5"" and about 35lbs and it was tight around his knees, and not just fashionably tight, the material has no give so it was just squeezing his knees. The shirt is also pretty short and overall everything is just pretty tight. If you order this go a size up, I wish we had the time to get another before we left town Friday but I doubt we will, I was going to do pictures of my two sons in matching in these outfits. We also got the 0-3 month size and it is softer but runs larger. I loved these and really wish they had been a stretchier material for the larger size or a little more fabric had been used, I worry after one wash that they'll shrink to much to wear again üò≠<br /><br />Cute overall but go up a size or two for sure in the toddler sizes and order way ahead of when you need them in case you need to exchange.",0
3,The post of the earing was at the top of the earing which makes them hang,0
1,"This company CLAIMS to have this lifetime warranty to back their product! They CLAIM that if it‚Äôs lost, stretched, ripped, etc. that they will replace it for free, forever!! Well, I have sent them two emails and a Facebook message for them to honor this warranty... and guess what!? Crickets. Never heard back from them! I don‚Äôt normally leave reviews but this has me upset. I am in Law Enforcement. I was wearing my ring to work, and it slipped off while on duty. I was hoping to replace is... and I received absolutely no response!! Very disappointed!!!",0
2,I was hoping these would be awesome but they are not. Do hard to use and too big.,0
5,Billfold is just what I wanted! Very fast shipping!,1
5,I love the fabric light and airy. Very comfortable.,1
5,Bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it. They said it was comfortable and perfect for wearing around the house.,1
1,"The person on the picture must be extremely tiny.  This is a great gift for children,  but will not properly fit any average adult. The arms were very short on my teen; if you attempt to buy order big.",0
5,Me agrada el acabado,1
5,They break down too quickly. I wear them constantly.,1
1,"They aren't oversized. They don't cover my husband's glasses, but they did fit over mine.",0
4,"This is great.  Very comfortable.  Looks pretty good, not many things like it. doesnt restrict movements.  Sizing might be difficult, but just remember this isnt meant for larger, european type peoples, typically.<br /><br />It's not as shiny as it is in the picture, but I find that better, because other wise it draws attention, and its fake leather, so you dont want that anyway.  This will keep ya warm in 50-60 degree california weather. But it wont be to hot on warmer days.  Good clothing for Los Angeles.  Very happy with this,  The color is pretty good to, sturdy and it stays up.  4/5 because its not shiny, but hey, its better that way.",1
1,"Terrible fit, incredibly short, hardly any coverage on the breasts. Talk about side boob. I‚Äôll be returning. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",0
4,"If you don't want the white egg looking case for your Airpod then this is a great pouch/skin/cover to use.  You open the case fully, slide your Airpod case in completely then fully close lid over top.  When you open next the lid on this will open your case for you revealing your buds.  There is a opening in the bottom for your charging port to be obstruction fee.  The exterior is nice soft leather, the interior is a hard durable plastic.  On the side is a small loop you can add a hook, key-ring, or cord to.",1
5,Cashmere is the best!  Thank you for the fine quality and beautiful color.  My wife is enjoying it and has worn is non-stop since receiving it.  Thanks again.,1
2,This dress is not large enough in the chest area if you are bigger than a c cup. Sad the dress didn't fit.,0
5,Beautiful earrings and well made.,1
4,Cute top just too thin for my liking...wish it would have a thick stretch to it.  But overall comfy n stylish.,1
3,Good,0
2,It wasn't silver. It was a grey that looked old,0
5,Quality is so great - not the least bit flimsy. Husband has two to use in his fairly large sized backpack for work. My daughter and I each have one for large purses where more 'pockets' are great in a bucket of a purse or tote.,1
2,The arm sleeves are far too small and there is no room for boobs. Also the fabric is sheer.,0
5,The fit is perfect sml/med 13.5 calf has a no-slip band at the top holds up with running and washing cold plus low dry.,1
2,it fits everywhere but around my thigh area it bubbles up by the buttons .,0
5,"I ordered this because my husband left me his Apple Watch 3. His band was a little too bulky for me so I thought the slim one was a great idea, especially a pack of two colors!<br /><br />The slim design looks less bulky ( I took a picture with my old one for comparison) and is still very durable. I love the fact that I can regulate the size of my band without risking it to slide along the band and avoiding the whole in it. This creates a slick and smooth design that I really enjoy.<br />I also believe the band is made out of silicone, which is perfect for me when I go running or swimming (I do mermaiding and I live to be able to count my calories underwater). I also feel pretty confident about not losing my watch in the pool as the whole where you insert the band literally does a little calp noise and seems very secure.<br />Overall, it is a fantastic product that comes in two colors for a good price. It was my first time changing an apple watch band and it was super easy ( if it's yours too: there is buttons to press in the back of your watch!) to take off and put on again! I would recommend and probably will buy some more when I want a change of colors!",1
2,leg holes to large,0
5,Adorable graphics,1
3,ok but bunchy on sides most likely a night gown not a dress.,0
3,Tafeta material and the waist is very tight. The zipper is not a heavy zipper either.,0
5,THE CUTEST JEWELRY EVER!!! Great alternative to non pierced ears!,1
5,"Good quality, sturdy and stiff",1
5,Love this bra. Most sports bras tend to feel like they are pulling on my shoulders and this one doesn‚Äôt. Very supportive and breaths really well,1
5,"The color of this charm/bead is beautiful!  It blends well with blues, greens, and white color Pandora beads.  This is a great addition to any Pandora bracelet and it's excellent quality!",1
5,"i have maximum engraving on both sides and the spelling was perfect, shipping was quick",1
1,Poor quality.,0
2,Wasn't what I expected in a compression garment. It's more of a workout shirt. Though it offers no compression I wear for my workouts.,0
5,"Great quality and definitely 100% authentic.  Just what I was looking for!  It fits my iPhone 7 Plus, cash and cards, lipstick and/or chapstick, and a few other small things when I just want to travel light!",1
4,Soft gripper socks. I bought the largest size for my husband but they were too small so I wear them.,1
2,"Not as advertised. Socks are made for mans sized foot.  Thin quality & short in length; they are not Knee hi's.  Maybe mid calf at best. After I washed, blue color sock was stretched out badly in toe area after washing and I don't recommend buying these socks.",0
5,Lovely.,1
1,The video made it look so easy to use. It did not work for me.,0
2,This dress is cut way too small. I sized up also.,0
1,"Unfortunately after one wash, it shrunk and cannot be worn. If you plan to order, I would order 1 size up. Stinks I already washed; I would‚Äôve returned otherwise..",0
3,"Due to Covid-19, I was laid off from my bartending job and opted to find other work rather than apply for unemployment. So now I work stocking freezers with boxes of meat. Glamorous, I know. It‚Äôs freezing cold and I have to constantly cut open packaging that holds the boxes together, so instead of using the communal freezer gloves I decided to buy these because I also have a tendency to scrape or cut my hands. They work, definitely. They protect from cuts and are pretty warm which is a plus, but I purchased the size small and they‚Äôre still to big. I can‚Äôt really use them because the extra fabric flopping at my finger tips makes it hard to get a decent grip on the boxes. I can probably give them to my boyfriend so I won‚Äôt return them but I wish they came in a smaller size.",0
5,My granddaughter had this on her Christmas list & loves it!,1
3,I ordered these for a plus sized friend. I am a 12 and they fit me nicely. I usually wear a medium or large and prefer a soft fit instead of a very snug fit. The plus size fit me like a large in other brands. I like the fabric and would order more keeping the size in mind.,0
3,"I ordered these as Christmas gifts for family and co-workers.  The set came with two sets of cross earrings which are not pictured.  I didn't want any cross earrings.  I con't have time to return them because I have to mail packages asap.  The earrings look nice, but now I have two pairs that I can't use.",0
1,so small,0
1,"This tank top runs ridiculously small. I usually wear XL when I workout because I prefer looser more flow-y tops. I saw the reviews that said it runs small, so I bought the 2X, and couldn't believe the fit. It's practically skin tight. I would return it, but the price makes it not worth it.",0
2,I love the IN BLUE selection. Inexpensive and not bad quality. I have been waiting a few weeks now. Product delivery date keeps getting extended.,0
3,I didn't realize this was a Hi-Lo dress based on the photos. Very comfortable material.,0
5,It is so pretty in my cartilage. That part of the ear was pierced by a gun. The jewelry was so easy to put in that hole. I just ordered a blue one.,1
5,I purchased this same wallet 8 years ago and the snap to keep it closed finally gave up. I love this wallet and it is perfect and very durable to last me 8 years with daily use. It looks so nice and new compared to my old one. If it is available in 8 more years I will purchase it again.,1
4,"This bracelet is great, however it fits 4 different width watches with proper pin-bars. It is advertised as 4 different length pins and a Jeweler""s Tool, included. None if them were included. So I had to go to a Local Jeweler to have this installed and pay an extra $5.00.<br />In my case it could have been worse. The width of pins were OK.",1
1,"Do not spend your money on this, it is synthetic fabric, and I have to confess that I had never seen so many fluff, when I took off the coat I had fluff all over my body, even in my eyes.",0
3,"I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loves the concept. Since January though it's already tearing up. I'll end up buying him a nicer more expensive wallet sometime soon, but I can't complain too much. It's pretty cheap cost wise (oh, he carries a license, 2 credit cards, some cash, and insurance in it... So it's not the amt of stuff)",0
5,Love um! I bought them because I can never find black ankle socks that fit me in women's. These fit great and are washing and holding up well.,1
1,Was bigger than described,0
1,Watch broke after two weeks;  very poor quality and would not recommend it,0
1,"The space where you load sits is so narrow.<br />It is rather complicated to get the st k centered and through to the other side. When trying to wear these for the second time, they just snapped in half.",0
2,Not at all what I expected or layered as shown. Disappointed....,0
1,2 of these charms broke about an hour after my 15 yr. old granddaughter put them on her bracelet.  She was just sitting around at our Christmas dinner.  It was the one in the middle the two pieces came apart & the bottom left the center silver piece fell out.,0
5,"This line works with my frame.  I have not been disappointed in the 3 years ordering this line. They wash easily, line dry nicely and it just works.",1
5,It is exactly as pictured. Very pretty,1
2,"I am disappointed that these sweats don't fit me.  They are cut low in the back & smaller there.  Legs fit fine.  Soft and comfy materisl, just way too small.",0
3,I'm a d to dd it takes some practice but they work,0
4,"These fit my son very well.<br />The only issue was that the color looks more pink. Our son doesn't seem to mind, but it is a little too pink.",1
5,Love it!,1
5,I love my new bracelet it easy to put on and  so pretty got a lot of compliments thank you,1
5,Good pair of sunglasses so far so good,1
2,"Runs so small, I ordered a 3x, one size larger than I normally wear. Couldn't get it over my shoulders.",0
3,"I only paid 15 dollars...so I wasn't expected much.. the fabric is soft an comfy...the design look to be done by someone inexperienced, as some of the letters were not aligned.",0
5,"It's a beautiful watch, and, so far, it keeps time. It can be difficult to read, since the hands are silver on a silver background.",1
5,fantastic for the value,1
5,Awesome... love it...,1
5,"It is truly going to fit anyone.  There are no prepunched holes.  Simply, put the belt on, tighten it as much as you want, and it creates the hole for you.  And, if you gain or lose weight, you just repeat the same procedure.",1
5,Cool little bag. Its very roomy and durable. I tie this bag to my belt and use or to collect tinder while walking brought the woods. You can never have too much combustible material. I have a second one that I used to keep a spare fire kit in. This product is tried and true. Excellent!,1
5,Saved a pile of money through Amazon,1
5,doesn't fit head to well the front sticks out and when wearing it you feel like Elmore fud,1
3,Dress fit very well in every area except under the arms. Way too baggy and showed off the side boob area.,0
5,"I love these capris so much. 90 degrees is one of my favorite brands for leggings and capris. They're so comfortable and they're high rise which I love. I also love the material and the fact that they're not see through, which is hard to find. Definitely worth the price and worth buying!",1
5,Have now purchased several and given as gifts.  Great option when traveling.  Keeps clothes organized and also helps prevents your clothes from touching drawers at hotels ?  Lightweight and comes in many colors.  I use them when traveling and just love them.  Good quality but don‚Äôt overstuff for zipper is good but not great .... definitely would buy again !!!,1
5,"I bought these to replace the cheap ones that came on some key labels. Good quality, good size, I don't worry about the keys becoming detached from the labels.",1
5,"great little gift for a lady's birthday, church auction, grab bag, etc.",1
4,"Really nice and soft, fits well, and is suitably punk. It only looses a star because the material picks easily",1
4,Wonderful bra but fits slightly bigger than what I am used to.,1
3,"Very pretty dress and quality material. Very fitted top, arm straps too big, and bigger in waist and hip area",0
1,I bought a 3xl because it says they run small and it fits like a medium very unhappy with this vest,0
1,This product was nothing like the pictures portrayed it to be. Very Disappointed!,0
5,Another great bag!  Just enough room for everyday use.,1
3,"They are cute, pretty transparent, and could look orangish . A better price would be $7.99 for these.",0
5,Fits real nice I am just loving this dress.  Got a lot of compliments at work,1
5,Exactly as described.,1
3,"This dress is really nice.  The lace is a good quality and it fits as expected.  I do have to return it just because it is not a flattering fit on me.  I knew that was a possibility in advance, but gave it a shot.",0
3,"Not as wide as I thought it would be,if phone rings hard to get out fast,",0
1,Cheaply made,0
1,Fell apart within two days of wear - buy a different option!,0
2,I got this ring and FELL IN LOVE with it.....UNTIL I used hand sanitizer at a hospital my family member was having a baby.  My ring instantly turned a bronze/goldish color.  Every time I wear this ring I get compliments on it.  I wear a size 9 ring and found that this ring was true to size and didn't feel the stone was to big for my hand.  I really wished this wouldn't have turned or would have been able to purchase in sterling silver.,0
1,I‚Äôll fitting. Really just weird all around. Not well made and had a smell.,0
5,Super cute!..I love the style. I will buy again soon. Thank you,1
1,Bought a size larger than my usual and too small and had a hole in them,0
3,"The post of the nose ring is too long for my nose. Shipped fast and secure- came in a large package for a small item. Well priced, just does not work for me.",0
5,"These are the most comfortable underwear I own. The spandex is breathable and soft. They don't ride up, and they aren't too tight. They fit exactly as I thought they would",1
5,"Super cute. Wished they had more colors. Would order more. Size chart is off though. I'm a size 2, 34-27-37. But I ordered a Small to match the measurements on the chart, and it's too big. Should have stuck with the xs-size 2 equivalent",1
3,Cute but I‚Äôd suggest ordering 2 sizes up,0
4,Works great.,1
3,Pretty lace & colors but the cups were so small & not flattering & not very supportive. To flimsy of a bra......good for a teenager but not a 62 year old.,0
1,Love it but broke within a week hate the fact i paid so much for it,0
3,They work but photo ia deceiving. The face on it has a couple inches of black over the top part and its hard to get is exactly as shown. They still work for coverage but not what i was expecting.,0
3,"Fabric was cheap and polyester-y. I like the pattern and the color was true to the picture. Fit was large, especially around the top and arms. I should have ordered a size or two down.",0
3,I liked my Reba sandals and thought the tennis shoes would be the same. Nope. No support or cushion really. Okay for a grocery run but not for long distance walking running.,0
3,Nice bright print but cheap material. Runs small.,0
5,"This fit perfectly, the color is rich, and the fabric is lovely. I decided the cropped style doesn‚Äôt flatter me, so I am sending it back. But it really is a lovely cardigan!",1
5,It's pretty and fits well,1
5,"Cute, soft, great colors and patterns, thin, great for summer.",1
1,DON'T BUY THIS DRESS<br />it looks nothing like the  picture. It's  very cheap made and the material is very thin and cheap  the tulle wasn't  even sewn together and there was no way to get it to fluff  out the under layer you could see though it and you could  never make it full and fluffy  like the picture was Goodwill  quality  don't  waste your money,0
5,Thank you üòä!,1
1,Hole in the crotch when I received leggings. I also bought grey pair. Not squat proof.,0
1,Is thin and made of cheap material. Wont stay zipped up and its not to small is actually loose on me.,0
1,Super weird cut. Its loose at the top and middle and then hugs at the hips making it have a bulgy middle that is not flattering at all.,0
4,"I love how they fit, and they were a perfect length, and the. I washed them. They're highwaters now. I still wear them, they're super comfortable, I just wish they hadn't shrunk in the wash.",1
5,I LOVE this bag! I wish the handles were a little bit longer.,1
5,Gorgeous!!! These are stunners!,1
1,"This case is made of very low quality materials.  The sides bend in when you try to open it.  It is extremely hard to open..  The bad thing is I bought 3 different designs, they are all the same.  Need to return them!!!  Found a much better quality one at Walmart for 1/3 the price of this.",0
5,"Se ajustaron muy buena la talla de mi pie, lo mejor es por las correas que te permiten tener el pie m√°s libre al momento de caminar. Lo que si es que no es recomendable caminar por lugares selv√°ticos o con espinas.",1
1,Stitching came apart soon as I put it on these DuRags is trash,0
2,Was not as solid feeling as other wooden ones I have had. I carry in my pocket and was hoping for something that had a durable feel.,0
5,"Cutest dress  I have ever owned! I received so many compliments and people asking where I  purchased it. Makes you feel like a sexy, desirable woman, but a little girly at the same time!",1
2,The quality is ok it gets very bent out of shape and digs into your wrist leaving red marks since it's a cuff. Love the prayer. I purchased two and can never wheat due to irritating my skin were cuff is closed as far as it can go,0
1,"The loop on the end of one of the cords was broken, that is the thread that forms the loop was unraveled and disconnected, so no loop on one end to hold my glasses. The other cord was ok.",0
5,Very cute.,1
5,Pay attention- they're small and subtle. Look elegant. Good gift for a music learning child.,1
3,"I was expecting the umbrella to be light weight, but it feels heavy when I am holding it.  I'm looking for an automatically open and close umbrella however it doesn't retract.  The handle was greasy with some mechanical oil and smells bad.  Not sure if I will keep it...",0
4,"This watch is very pretty and looks as nice as the picture. I bought it because I like that the watch is thin, however, it's surprisingly heavy. I've had it for about a month with no issues and it keeps time well.",1
2,"This is a gift for my future god-daughter, which I am taking to out-of-state in a couple of months; the product/ shoe seemed wide-sized, which I was not expect!",0
5,It makes me look gorgeous. I bought it for myself and have no regrets. I would recommend the earrings to everyone.,1
3,The face protector did not come with the watch band,0
1,this picture does not look like the one hat that i had selected.  I have waited too long to return it.,0
3,The fabric was sewn slightly off center so I had to cut the neckline and one sleeve to fix it. The fabric is nice and the dress is very cute.,0
5,Just perfect,1
2,"These were the gift tags give as a result of ordering the Initial luggage tags.  Since they did not match the others, we could not use them.  We just placed them in our storage area.",0
1,These are a very weird fabric and they are totally see through,0
3,This is a cute dress but I am about 5'6&#34; and 116 lbs and ordered a small.  I am swimming in it.  If they had an xtra small I would definitely try it.,0
5,"Warm and fit well.  I've washed them a couple of times.  Air dried them.  No loose threads, no problems.",1
5,Love it!,1
3,"I was disappointed with the fabric type and color.<br />As shown in attached photos, the color is darker than beige. Also, the fabric pattern has a checkered weave. Therefore, the material and color doesn‚Äôt have a smooth feel.<br />Material looks like bamboo fiber; instead of polyester, rayon and spandex blend.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and wear 6-8 regular or medium but the sleeves were too long and more loose.<br />Also, the front does not have a breast tuck (see photo). Fits mannish than feminine.",0
5,"Extremely comfortable and true to size. Color is a little different, but still lovely.",1
2,Color is far different then expected,0
1,This shirt is very very thin and one can see though the material...cheaply made...my lesson...you get what you pay for,0
1,Cheap material and poorly made.  Ripped on the first try,0
1,"Looks and feels awful to wear, blisters in a couple minutes. Looks like they were cobbled together by a drunken 4 yr old.",0
5,"My grandson loved it! He didn't even know that he wanted it until we gave it to him. Perfect for the Dr Who fan, especially the teen!",1
5,Got these as a gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves them.,1
5,"I got these to replace old ribbon laces that broke. They're a perfect fit for my shoes, and better than the original laces.",1
3,"Beware, size runs way smaller than the chart indicates. Decent fabric quality and all though.",0
2,"Cheaply made. I got one from Venus, this is a very poor substitute",0
2,They did not fit‚òπ,0
4,Cuter in person than in the pic.,1
5,"This wallet is beautiful and very feminine. It holds everything cash, coins and credit cards without being bulky. It fits in my purse so slim. I would love to buy it again in a different color. I strongly recommend this wallet.",1
4,I actually lived the,1
1,These run so small I got almost 2 sizes up and still way small and the material they are made of fills chep,0
1,It had a scuff and lots of bumps on it very cheap looking!,0
1,Very tiny don't really fit and my neck is pretty small seems child sized,0
3,"It is very comfortable and I like the color.  The only thing I don‚Äôt like is where the belt is, it‚Äôs much higher than my waist so I would go up a size.",0
4,Keeping in mind the low cost of entry this really is a nice watch. Lots of details on the face and keeps time well so far. I'd buy another one if I found a different color combo.,1
1,did  not like fabric or fit,0
3,"I Loved this shirt! But it was extremely tight around the arms and cut my chest off weird, almost like the top part of the shirt was sewn as a small but the bottom flared out perfectly for me which is hard to come by.  Ended up returning.",0
1,Was very disappointed in this purchase.  I am returning it because it's already falling apart.  The toggle on the zipper broke and a rivet already fell off.  I didn't use it for a week.  I liked the idea of side pockets and because it was leather.,0
2,The picture makes the product appear much better than it is in fact.,0
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money!  You will definitely lose your Garmin with this cheap thing!  The bands do not fit securely inside the watch and the pins pop out.  If only I had the original packaging I would return!,0
5,"40 pices is a lot so it is good for pinata filler, each has a small elastic band to hold on the finger.  Each color gives a different light color.",1
5,Just as expected. Great,1
5,Great quality. Good fit.,1
5,I am happy with my purchase and feel like I got my money's worth. I ordered the necklace and earrings together. This necklace really is a statement piece. Don't wear it if you don't want to be noticed.,1
5,Great price & delivered before expected date,1
3,The bracelet is adjustable and sturdy. The earrings are metal but the plastic turquoise piece comes off so easily. Can probably hot glue it back on easily. The hair peice is also metal but oddly shaped. Doesn‚Äôt fit well against the head because it‚Äôs not rounded and actually curves outward at one end. Would still purchase again because it was for daughters birthday and she loved it.,0
5,A little big but good quality,1
1,The material is cheap. The pants had a hole on the side where the thread came out. The zipper ran of the track. I am so disappointed,0
1,Extremely disappointed in this product!! got it for my husband December 2020 and already is coming apart at the seam!!!,0
5,The white is actually an off-white which I wasn't expecting.,1
5,Beautiful earrings!,1
5,Still wearing after years of use! And is so comfy!,1
5,So nice. Perfect for sunny days,1
5,"This bag is amazing....it's strong, cute and works better then any of my other handbags. I love it and would order it again on a heartbeat.",1
2,The polarization in these is minimal.,0
4,It's blue but I like it,1
5,Love them,1
5,"Love this top.<br />Perfect length to show a little but not too much.<br />Fabric is comfortable and the extra button on the back help everything feel snug.<br />I'm 5'6&#34;, 161lbs, athletic build.",1
4,Very cute and soft!,1
5,Great dress for a special occasion!,1
5,"The pin is very attractive and exactly what I wanted.<br />  My order was shipped in a barely padded envelope and as would be expected it was smashed flat.  The clasp wouldn't even come off.  That being said, customer service was excellent and I received a replacement within a week.  Surprisingly, it too was in an envelope.  Guess I was lucky.",1
4,"Great product, but 2 minor issues.<br /><br />1. These do not cover the back of the shirt. They work great for the sides and part of the front, but the back will stick out like a duck tail.<br />2. They dont really follow the curve of the leg. My legs bend in a little bit and every so often I would notice the band through my pants when I was sitting or standing still.<br /><br />Other than that, the product is great and I would use it again. It was my first time using a product like this.",1
5,My husband never use to wear a ring now he does!,1
4,"The dress is beautiful, but it runs one size small.",1
5,Great quality for a novelty sock! Will order again!,1
5,"Colorful, great flip flop",1
4,Great for the price.,1
3,ok,0
2,It made me feel off...and eyes were still tired.,0

4,Perfect,1

5,"ncial industry, I am required to wear a tie daily.  I have bought and worn hundreds of ties over man years.  These have been purchased from expensive malls to Marshals or TJ Max.  Mall ties can run anywhere from $20 on the cheap side to $60 or more at Macy's or Nordstrom's.  I was paying between $12 and $20 at discount stores.  I was fortunate to find this tie on Amazon.  It is very high quality and the fabric is not too thin or too thick.  The tie received unsolicited compliments from my wife and children, several of my colleagues, and 2 clients.  I would not hesitate to highly recommend the Silk Ties Jacquard Classic Woven Formal Casual Tie Necktie Checked<br />.  In fact, after receiving the tie I went back and purchased several other colors and several as gifts.<br /><br />I received this product at either no cost or at a deeply discounted price; in return, I am providing my honest and unbiased opinion, along with a brief description of my experience with the product, whether it be positive or negative. I have no connection to the company/seller, I am not required to write a positive review, and I am not receiving monetary compensation in anyway.",1
4,"The bra fit perfectly, very sexy. The panties were too small tho",1
2,There is no back of the neck protection because of the slit in the material. When you put it on it opens up and exposes the back of your neck. Especially if you use the chin snap. This design flaw can be fixed by the company adding 2 more snaps down the back slit.<br /><br />The workaround that I found was to use the face mask as the neck protector. It‚Äôs not practical but it works.<br /><br />I suggest trying on or buying sun hats locally vs buying them online.<br /><br />As for the fit. It will fit someone with a big head. My head is 23 and I had to tighten it a lot.,0
5,Gift to teenagers...they loved them!,1
3,"For this price, I was unimpressed. Material is thin and the color was more of a khaki versus stone.",0
2,Very pretty. Came on time. No way would this fit! I 'm normally between sizes 16-18.  I usually wear Xlarge.  It's a shame because it's a nice dress and I would have liked to have it for my vacation.,0
5,They are very cool !!,1
1,Did not like at all! The dress was too tight and very thin fabric.,0
5,Love them! Got so many compliments on these. The only issue is some were way too big so I couldn't wear them at all. But my fingers are small (about a size 5) so it's understandable that I couldn't fit them all.,1
5,Bought this for a dear friend who looked awesome.  Fit and looked Great<br /><br />Thank You<br />Joe C.,1
5,"Very very beautiful watch, wish the links were adjustable for smaller and regular wrists",1
3,The only thing I would change is the thin zipper! If you pull to hard you will break it.. otherwise very cute!,0
3,"Not a bad looking watch, but band is MUCH deeper pink than pictured. The face is actually nicer looking.<br />My daughter liked the cute saying on the face. Price was reasonable so decided to try it. The watch is working<br />well so far, but we only have it for two weeks.",0
1,The band does not fit properly and you have to keep putting in the passcode. The clasp does not work properly and it fell off my wrist and I lost my Apple Watch!,0
5,"These pants are wonderful.  I was amazed at what a difference they make in my appearance. I have unfortunately gained weight and most of it is settling around my middle.  These pants are very comfortable, stretchy all over but they don't look like stretch pants.  I know as I lose weight, which I am doing slowly, these pants will still fit and look great because of the stretch.  I am going to buy a pair in every color.  Watch the pricing as the denim option is priced almost half the other colors, but that wasn't the case when I ordered my denim.",1
4,"The charm on the front is a little crooked, and because it's so heavy you'll need help fastening it as tight as possible (I ask someone for help) to keep it in place. Any looseness will result in the bracelet twisting around on your wrist.<br /><br />Other than that, this arrived weeks before expected and it's going to be a great addition to my Halloween costume and I can easily wear it day-to-day as well!",1
1,Thin see thru wrinkled ugly,0
4,Not as cute as the pictures but ok.,1
1,Not worth a dime.,0
2,"This robe was very large on me, and very stiff/scratchy.  It was heavy, and I do not recommend it.  Maybe it would be okay for a man??  I am a woman, 5'2"".",0
4,"They‚Äôre really soft and stretchy... but they keep sliding down. I‚Äôve been wearing them as I work from home, and no matter how high I pull them up, they‚Äôll ride down when I move. I wore them out in public once and it was really annoying to keep pulling them up. They seem to fit fine everywhere else",1
5,Love my new pjs there soft and nice,1
5,fits my body right,1
4,just what we hoped it would be,1
5,"I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and about 140# I got this in the navy and a size small and it‚Äôs comfortable, it‚Äôs a loose kinda fitted look, I am more pear shaped so that‚Äôs where the sorta fitted comes into play and it ends about 2‚Äù above my knees, it‚Äôs very cute and it was soft right out of the package and still soft after the first wash, I‚Äôm in the process of replacing pajamas and night gowns and I might actually be ordering more in different colors",1
5,I am 5‚Äô1 155 and ordered size large. The fit and compression is perfect.,1
5,"I have always loved these shoes, I think overall they are pretty great.",1
5,I am 5' 6&#34; tall and 129 lbs....and the medium fit me really well.  It seems to be made well and looks very flattering!  Love the style and will get another one.  I usually wear size smalls...so... I would get one size up.,1
5,LOVE THEM!  Wear them all the time and the are super comfortable!,1
5,"she loves the socks!!!  great quality  , the colors are superb , specially the price and the quality , we work all day long and my god, the shoes and the socks are going to be great quality  , you have to take care of your feet!!!  your back will thank you!!!  soft soft soft",1
3,"I was looking to replace a button with a snap behind it as I like things open. The snap showed when open so I‚Äôd have to keep the cardigan snapped when wearing. üí° a frog closure and then I saw this, it looked perfect something I wouldn‚Äôt have to sew on. It arrived fast and when I put it on the cardigan it looked almost perfect except there was too much gap between the sweater front. I think it probably would be great for cape, poncho or even a heavier winter scarf it‚Äôs even okay of the cardigan but just alittle too much gap for me.",0
1,The Left flip is smaller/shorter than the right flop. In one day (absolutely zero exaggeration) the cushioning under my heels is completely compressed and hard as a rock. The sandal straps also quickly stretched.  I was planning to buy additional pairs in black and dark brown...but now must reconsider. I've been wearing Reefs for over 20 years. This is the first pair that has failed me.,0
5,This ring is absolutely gorgeous!! The details is awesome!!! I got one for my bestfriend!! She ‚ù§Ô∏èIt too!! Great job on this anchor ring!!! üíúüíúüíú it!!!,1
5,"Very useful for carrying fob, I have gotten many compliments on the bracelet.",1
4,"This bracelet is so versatile.  Wear as  a bracelet, necklace or hair band!!!  I love it's hand made look. Mostly brown beads and a few metal ones in the front.  Now I do have small wrists so, even when tightening it was still a bit loose on me, still wearable though, but not like I like it to fit!  I wrapped it twice around my wrist.  But it worked great as a necklace and a headband accessory.  It does fit my son's wrist perfect, and he liked it too!  It's versatile for either gender.  It's a nice bracelet that came in a zippered case, which was a nice surprise, it has it's own storage.  Nice handmade looking piece of jewelry.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.  This review is based on my own experience and opinion of the product.",1
3,I ordered a size 9 and it fit quite big..a half size smaller would hv been perfect,0
4,"They are just as pictured and described, a bit too heavy for a charm though",1
2,The fabric glitter was coming off . It had to be glued on and I hope it stays on.,0
1,Horrendous. More is falling out of the sides than the front I tightened up the straps & it just got worse! I don‚Äôt recommend this bra!,0
3,"The length was a little shorter than I usually wear, but the feel good.  They did not shrink in the wash, nor have they faded or torn.  I'll most likely order more when the time comes.",0
5,Looked great!,1
5,Loved it! Got so many compliments it was form fitting and the material was great.,1
5,Love it!,1
5,It was for my wife to wear to see if copper actually helps with arthritis. Even if it doesn't it's a pretty bracelet and she likes it.,1
1,"The band was NOT red, it was orange! Very disappointed!",0
1,Shirt was to big for a 3x. I wear a 2x but like 3x and this was more like a 5x,0
3,Fits perfectly on top but down in the legs it‚Äôs wide.,0
4,"I love this jacket, but, as everybody commented, the buttons were sewn out of place. I had to remove all buttons and sew them back at where they should be.",1
5,Like everyday sports  watch and functional,1
3,It‚Äôs definitely very narrow and tight. Not what I expected. But the slippers self is very nice,0
3,Too long:(,0
5,Amazing dress!,1
1,"These turned blasck after one day of wear, clearly not stirling silver. Fingers crossed the return goes well.",0
5,GREAT,1
2,About three sizes too small!,0
5,I love this hat!  I walk everyday and this hat give you excellent protection from the sun.,1
5,They work well and stay up!,1
2,"Thought I was buying a drifit polyester fabric, this is more like see through nylon. Super cheap and everything sticks(fibers) to it in the washer/dryer. Thought I was getting a good deal at $31, but not even worth $10. Super disappointed.",0
5,"I have some ratchet belts that I liked because they didn't have holes, and were easy to adjust or remove, but they had a problem with the clamp that keeps the buckle attached to the belt, which would come off very easily.  So I tried one of the military style clamp belt, which was OK.  Then, I saw this style, and decided to try one.  Once I got used to it, I liked it a lot, and went to order another and found this brand that looked the same, but was cheaper.  I ordered two, one for me and one for my son.  It's exactly like the old one, so I plan to order more while there is a discount on the already cheaper price.",1
5,"Beautiful dress, beautiful fit",1
4,I bought this for a gift so haven't used it but it looks well made and is very cute!,1
5,Very nice looking band for a decent price.,1
5,Looking super cool on my Great-son... true to size!,1
2,"I ordered this bag to carry to work as I didn‚Äôt have a lot to carry with me. I only used it for about a month and the strap just completely ripped off. It wasn‚Äôt on a seam, the ‚Äúleather‚Äù strap just ripped into two pieces.",0
5,This was a perfect addition to our daughters 21st birthday celebration. Fun times.,1
1,"Poorly made, do not purchase.",0
1,One tile is cracked and several have white gouges. I also ordered a color one and that one is perfect.,0
3,"Greater material, sturdy and I like the width of the strap, but i didnt notice it doesnt have a handle. Great fast shipping.",0
4,"Cute sweater, but runs a little big.",1
5,"I received so many compliments on this dress, I can't wait to order more patterns in the future. They are all unique and really make me stand out at the office!",1
5,"Very comfortable and fits as expected, soft feeling<br />Purchased two more t-shirts of this brand",1
1,This was NOT glittery.  It was just plain purple cloth.,0
5,It is hi/low blouse like I like it.  I purchased the blue and black one.  I wear with pants and long skirts.,1
5,They look sexy once you put them on,1
3,"It looks nice in the photos, however the actual product feels a lot cheaper.",0
5,Love this dress.  So comfy and exactly what I was hoping for.,1
4,"Very pretty, size was as advertised. The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the zipper on this dress is a huge pain! I chose this dress for my bridesmaids to wear and every one of them (five total) has said they love the dress but hate how difficult the zipper is!",1
5,Looks amazing on my bracelet,1
5,"Great fabric, style is accommodating and comfortable. Washes well. Ordering in more colors.",1
2,Don't buy! Very bulky hardware. It can't keep a charge. It's very difficult to charge.  All of the audio components of this are very disappointing. I'm giving 2 stars instead of one because the actual hat is okay.,0
5,"Wow, how cool it is! I bought a white one for myself and a black one for my husband. Both fits us perfectly! Lens are very clear and the strap is adjustable. Can't wait to wear it for our skiing strip in Colorado next month!",1
5,thx!,1
3,Fade quickly,0
3,"A bit scratchy, and runs tight. But it does have a great shape to it.",0
5,I got this to play tennis in the south. It is great to keep you comfortable when you are running around. It keeps you coool whether it is tied or not. It hangs well,1
3,"Super cute print and pattern but it wrinkles easily. I wore this to work and the back of the dress was wrinkled horribly affecting how it falls. Size wise- I would say this fit as expected and is accordance with the size information provided but it is not your standard american size, so pay close attention to the size guide. I got a size small and for reference I am 5'3, 120 lbs, chest 34B, waist 27 inches, hips 39 inches and it hits me 2 inches above my knee and I am happy with the fit. I am only giving this 3 stars because it wrinkles easily and I think the price is a bit on the higher side for this dress.",0
4,"Initial thoughts are that the belt seems sturdy.  However, beware on the sizing.  I ordered to match what I typically wear and it's a tight fit without using the hole punching tool (that was oddly included as a bonus item).",1
5,"My daughter and I use these gloves with lotion or prescription creams as my daughter and I both have eczema on our hands. These gloves are very soft, smooth and non irritating. I hand washed them and let them air dry. They fit me (44 yr old woman with smaller hands) and my slender 12 year old daughter well. Of course her fit is a little more loose but the small works for both of us. I LOVE the fingerless part of the gloves so that I do not feel confined and I can still use my fingers with my phone etc.",1
5,I love these suits they are flattering and great for the booty,1
1,I have been sent 2 sizes pair of flip flop!<br />left side is 11 and right side is 13 !!!  enlarge the pictures!<br />both sides including the 13 size are much much smaller than my actual feet size which is surprisingly 13 !!!!!<br />don't buy them.<br />returned.,0
5,"It's a beautiful watch that doesn't break the bank, and it tells time accurately. That's all I was looking for in a watc, mission accomplished.  Thank you",1
5,What a pleasant surprise!  These earrings are very elegant looking and worth every penny!  (no pun intended) The size was perfect.  I do think that the sellers should be more specific about size and show the earrngs nex to a ruler.,1
5,Does what it was intended to...<br /><br />Shirt collars are more comfortable.,1
5,Perfect length for my Tragus piercings. I love the vibrant colors and sparkly gems.<br /><br />Very easy to insert. I've worn the same 2 for a few months now and they still look brand new. No trouble with loose gems or gems falling out.<br /><br />Great price and excellent variety.,1
5,"Great dress! I‚Äôm typically a large/XL but I don‚Äôt like loose fitting clothes, so I ordered a medium. Fits great up top and loose at the bottom. Flows very well. Will buy againüôÇ",1
5,Exactly as pictured! They stones shine. Very impressive!,1
2,Led works great but the app is ridiculous! You can not put your own words in. I‚Äôm not sure if it is the app that is messed up or what.,0
5,I like it. It's exactly what I expected. I only wear it when i go out with the wifey.,1
1,Tooo small,0
5,SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BT IS A WELL MADE HANDBAG.,1
1,This bras does nothing to shape the bust area and the closure looks ugly and bent. The back is beautiful but I needed also some attention to the front part. The fabric feels hot and plastic. The sizes run small.,0
1,I bought this wallet in April for my fiance and it just fell apart completely fell apart. Not even 6 months and it just plain fell apart. The seller contacted me after my review and basicly told me you get what you paid for.,0
1,The shirt arrived worn with a large ball of hair on it.  I wish I could give it 0 stars.,0
5,Good for water trips- straps are a little uncomfortable to wear after awhile because there is no padding on them,1
3,I'm OK with that,0
1,The mask literally left marks on my faceü•≤ ridges. It definitely peels off your skin,0
3,Doesn't hold much sweat,0
4,I bought size small and this fits true to size. I'm size 4 or small usually.  117#  It is not too short.  It is a tiny bit loose fitting but still very cute.  Nice material.  Did not shrink at all in the wash.,1
5,Awesome!,1
5,Nice and soft and fit great,1
4,"The watch came in a scheduled, in a nice box and in perfect condition.<br />The watch itself looks and feels like an expensive one and the see thru mechanism it's really nice. I have  a week with it and hope that it will stay working good for a long time... So far a good purchase.",1
5,Perfect shades to protect little eyes and inexpensive enough that it‚Äôs okay when they get lost,1
5,Works well.,1
5,Nice quality.,1
2,"Its smaller than expected, before purchasing it i asked if it had a clasp and i was answered by the company that it did but it doesnt and its super long so when you wear it it doesnt show",0
3,I like the wallet but it looked like more then it actually is.,0
1,Didn‚Äôt work at all,0
1,The elastic in the front makes it fir like a maternity top !,0
5,These masks are very pretty.  Adjustable.  The lining in the inside is like a silky material and it is white.  The filter pocket made me feel like the mask was smothering me so I made an adjustment.  Still satisfied.,1
3,"100% cotton.... very much doubt it. I'll see when I try to dye it, but it feels synthetic to me.",0
4,"Not sure how the size or after use/wash material holds up since it was a gift.. Colors a little different than I was expecting, but still very precious outfit",1
5,"These bags are very sturdy, hold a lot of items, light weight when empty and easy to carry. Use with handle, and they also fit comfortably over your shoulder. Highly recommended!",1
3,Love them! Comfortable and trendy. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of compliments.,0
3,"Look good, but too big for my 3 yrs hands",0
1,I bought 2 the same size. One fit fine the other is WAY small.  Since I only tried one on before washing them I can't return the small one.  Annoying.,0
4,"There may be higher quality chokers, but this is a great option for the price.  No complaints.",1
5,Absolutely  love! Super flattering and very sexy !,1
4,Loved the material and colors.....just way too small.,1
1,"I am not happy with this purchase. The color was not gold, but silver and didn't match the necklace or bracelet I ordered. It did arrive before Christmas which I contacted the seller about, unfornately, I don't want to give it to my sister since it's not the right color at all to match. I would return it, but the price is not worth the shipping.",0
2,Ordered a size large but these run small.  I wanted running shorts but these fit like briefs.,0
1,"I bought the necklace expecting it to be beautiful, however the necklace came tarnished. Black on the back and the front of the necklace. Very disappointing.",0
4,Cute!,1
5,Great product I have been using them for almost three years,1
2,Really cute but they are super see through.,0
5,"These dies seem to be less brittle than the ones supplied with the Bekith press (which they fit perfectly). Highly recommended upgrade, even if you don't need the extra sizes or shapes.",1
4,"These are really pretty. They look great with my Persona bracelet. I have a couple Persona beads, but a majority of the beads I have are rand beads I bought through Amazon. These beads are a bit smaller than the Persona bead of the same style, but it's not a big deal. These shine just as bright as the Perona bead.",1
1,It didn‚Äôt hold its shape. It‚Äôs too big. And it‚Äôs a polyester like fabric kinda shiny. Not what I was hoping for at all.,0
5,The only part that fit big was the bra area but everything fit perfect!,1
3,"It's a very nice piece that was easy to attach. I wear my bracel often and after a few years the lettering is starting to fade. Otherwise, great product.",0
5,Nice quality and value!,1
1,"I was looking for something different from the wings I received and was not able to tell from the product description or reviews.  These wings are beautiful and sturdy.  The material is very thick, like felt.  I was looking for something beautiful, thin, and fluttery, more like silk.  So I returned them and did find exactly what I was looking for at a local store.",0
2,nice design but very small and the fabric was not great.,0
4,Love the cap.,1
4,"Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas because he is a fishery biologist (big fish nerd). Him, his family, and I all got a kick out of it. He wears them around at his office at school. I think they're pretty cute. They are BIG and wide. He probably wears a 10 or 11 and it fit him fine. He said they were soft. They weren't to thick and sturdy so I'm not sure how long they will last.",1
1,"The frame broke at the top, and I didn't even drop them.",0
1,The purse seemed cheaply built for TAHARI. Did not look good using it.,0
5,"True to size, very comfortable. Nice weight.",1
1,"I usually wear a large but, based on the reviews I sized up to the xxl and it fits like a small. The arms are wide enough like an xxl, but the width of the top is all wrong! It does look like the picture, but Because of the fit I gave it one star. I am going to keep it because it is pretty and unique.",0
1,"The day I put it in, i went to the gym and worked out thinking nothing of it & the dangling bow and pearls had already broken off. Better off just going to hot topic or piercing pagoda",0
2,you can blow out a candle while wearing it. (which means its not proper PPE) only 2 thick layers,0
5,"I bought these for my girlfriend because she had previously gotten into a car wreck and forgot to take her sunglasses out of her car! Bummer, right? Well, she had this pair of sunglasses that I absolutely LOVED on her and I was searching and searching and SEARCHING for these exact sunglasses - to find that she had bought them from a local store while she was up north!! Upon searching amazon, I found these! They aren't exactly like her old ones - but they are gorgeous! You can't beat the price, especially for the quality of these. They are absolutely gorgeous in person, you can't beat it. They will fit any face shape and look like they were made for you, as you wear them! Would recommend - if you're on the fence about getting these - this is definitely your sign to do so!",1
3,"I am 5'3, 165 lbs, 36C. I ordered the dress in a large. It was a little long without shoes on, but nothing that was impossible to walk in. The fabric is not exactly cotton, more like a jersey knit fabric (it's a tad shiny), and the dress fit besides the bust, which stretched out and made the fabric look too light (my reason for returning the item, but if they have it in a larger size I am planning on reordering it). Other than that, it isn't the greatest quality, which I expected, but some stitches did rip when I initially tried it on. So if you want this dress to last a while, be gentle to it!",0
1,One of the seams on this shirt was completely sewn wrong & the seam at the neckline was unraveled.  This is not a good product.,0
1,"Ordered two sizes up, still looked like it would fit a grade school girl.",0
5,Perfect fit & comfortable,1
1,No it didn't it's cheap looking and was delivered with missing stops don't waste your money,0
1,Way to loose in the top and no stretch for the body. Not for a short person with a little weight.,0
5,WARNING:I ordered the baby blue but it came very dark. DOES NOT look like it does in the pic!!!!!!!!! More of a dark navy blue/ purple. But overall i really like it and want to buy more!!!!,1
1,Awkward earring.  No matter where it‚Äôs placed it just looks strange.,0
5,Love these shades! Blocks the light and useful if you're ever without a bottle cap opener.,1
1,The fabric has no stretch at all. The arms was too tight but the waist area was large. The cleavage was too high. Was not flattering. Had to return it.,0
5,"Surprisingly good quality for the price, amazing detail. Very good product",1
3,Stone color is off.  I wish it was the same color as the picture.,0
5,"My grandpa always tells me that he's not my dogs' grandpa, so when I saw this hat I had to get it for him!  He loves it!",1
3,Does not stay in place while wearing.  Very pretty piece.,0
5,Great shirt,1
5,LOVE IT,1
4,"bought these for my granddaughter to wear under dresses, or exercise shorts and they work perfectly.  She can wear them as exercise shorts around the house (but not right for school dress codes).  They fit her well.",1
1,Arrived damaged,0
5,"I never knew buying a dress without trying it on could be such an amazing experience! Because of the reviews, I made this purchase, and I have not been disappointed at all! I‚Äôm leaving for a cruise on Sunday, and I‚Äôll be wearing this during that time. It is adorable, Fits amazing, very sexy, And is very forgiving and flattering at the same time. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!",1
3,"Liked speedy delivery of Prime. Green & black color goes perfectly with the color of the waterproof Lifeproof Fre case I have for my Galaxy S9Plus phone. Haven't used it yet but plan to use it when I go swimming indoors, now that it's cold here & also when I go down to Fla. & to Europe. Gave only 3 stars as some of the stitching has some lose threads hanging & the black plastic tabs at each side of the wrist float feel rough & I hope won't be uncomfortable in use nor unravel. Time will tell...",0
1,Soles are peeling of the sides of both shoes after limited use. Was part of Christmas gift for my son.,0
4,"I‚Äôm sad and happy about this purchase. The quality of the tee is nice and the graphic is nicely done as well. But it‚Äôs way too big. I looked at all the reviews. I checked the sizing charts. I compared body shape/size/height/weight. All signs pointed to a medium. The shirt looks like an L/XL, it is a loose fit.<br />It‚Äôll be a hassle to exchange so, I will end up gifting it. Even though I really wanted this one.",1
4,Neckline is a bit small,1
4,Great kick around shoes for my son who is hard on everything. We shall see how long they last but great value!,1
5,Nice fit and good quality!,1
1,Ripped in the washer,0
1,It's pretty and flattering from the front but if you have a butt beware it is far too short in the back.,0
3,"yep, like this one. Sometimes fl gets cold. Perfect.  the three star  is because some threads were unraveled and looked a little weird to my tall guy that can see the top of my head.",0
5,Great buy,1
2,"I liked the style of the shirt, but the fabric was not as I expected. it was a cheap fabric that was quite see through. I wouldn't suggest buying this product",0
1,"To big, to much plastic & didn't fit right!! SO not happy wanted my money back but probably to late now",0
1,Too long.,0
5,Love it,1
5,"The earings are just what I was looking for. The size is also just right. Not too big, not too small.",1
4,"So so soft! I'm 5'2&#34;, pregnant, and already chunky before hand..so leggings are my only pants tbh. Only problem is there needs to be a &#34;short&#34; option, the waistband goes all the way up to my chest, with a wider waistband it'd be better to fold them over. I'll make due tho, bc they aren't in any way see through, and the softness...worth the $13!",1
5,I got 36&#34; necklace and it looks totally sexy but koo...I only take it off when I shower other than that its always on...,1
5,"On cold winter mornings on the way to the gym, one needs inspiration-<br />I get that inspiration (and keep my ears warm), with this high quality knit hat-<br />Hat is made out of acrylic and cotton, which makes it stronger than just acrylic and DOMO himself is done in bright, rich colors-",1
5,I love having all these pockets! Made of good materials.,1
5,Live it,1
3,"I like them when I wear them very well, they're very pretty. But I throw them up on my head a lot, and I can't keep them there for anything! They slide backward or fall off and that's not cool.",0
5,Love the fabric and design.,1
5,I recommend getting one size bigger than your actual size! For example instead of getting a small I got a medium... That is if you're cosplaying Kenma! Overall I really like this cosplay outfit ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
3,"The umbrella is well made, appears that it'll last, but I was looking for traditional style and a wood handle.  It's plastic!<br /><br />Nothing in the description says that it's plastic.  I'm keeping it, but it's not what I thought I was getting.",0
3,A gift.,0
5,"Very well made, not too small, not too big. Love them. I also bought another pair (different style) from the same company  - just as happy with that pair too.",1
5,As described!,1
5,the gloves are just as I expected and fit my needs perfectly. I would definitely recommend to a friend and buy again.,1
3,Too much flare for my taste,0
5,very light not that protective,1
1,Not what I expected did not look as portrayed online,0
1,It was made cheap!,0
1,Very bad quality do not get this item,0
5,"My granddaughter just graduated from high school with two of her closest friends. I, too, graduated with two closest friends and we are still friends to this day. I gave the girls this necklace to celebrate their friendship with the hope that they will continue to stay friends forever. The card says it all.",1
3,Smaller then I thought they'd be and one earring was broken. Had to use superglue to get it to stick together since this was a Christmas present and I didn't have time to wait around for a refund or another pair to show up. Just hope my mom doesn't notice where I had to fix it.,0
5,Super soft and comfy ‚ù§Ô∏èüåª,1
5,"This is my husbands favorite sweatshirt. The quality is great, washes well. All around great purchase!!",1
5,Used as Halloween costume good product,1
4,"Our 4 y/o great-grandson's socks are constantly being lost. Who knows where they go, but our little guy has an inordinate number of single socks.<br /><br />I received these snaps in the mail along with some new PAIRS of socks and snapped them together. The snaps are a little hard to get through the top where the sock is thickest, but the placement makes sense. Once the socks are snapped together, toss them in the drawer, washer or dryer and they should stay together. I haven't tested the washer yet.<br /><br />This product is useful and fairly easy to ""install"". However, you still have to remember to snap them together once they are removed. Plan to buy more as little ""thought about you"" gifts to family with kidderliings.",1
5,This watch is very comfortable. Sometimes I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs on. I‚Äôve washed my hands many times as we all know we need to do. And it has not faded the fabric or messed up the battery on the inside,1
5,Love,1
1,"Do not buy these .. cheap , poorly made items , not worth the money",0
5,"Arrived on time and when I wear it, it was good that it fits on me after adjusting it.",1

5,Beautiful,1
1,"T e belt I received was cloth, not leather.  I did not get a leather one.  I am still trying to send the one I received back.  LOL!",0
4,"Cute little spoon that works for what I needed. However, it's plastic and feels like it could break easily. It would be better if the spoon was metal.",1
5,"I wear a comfortable xl normally,  this fits a little larger than I would like but I'm still happy with it. Came sooner than expected,  great quality.",1
3,Its not at all the color that it looks like in the picture. I was expecting more of a tangerine and its actually bright almost neon orange. It generally fits ok but the straps on the top are kind of weird. Some are super loose and dont quite lay right unless you keep pulling it down. But otherwise fits fine (I'm 5'9 weigh 145 size 34D and got the Large),0
5,I bought these for wardrobe on a film. They were perfect for the price and the use. If your looking to ise these for a costume they are great. I wouldn't use them for everyday use.,1
5,"These shoes WON the first day of second grade best shoes title!  There is no such thing, but they feel great, look amazing, and mothers want to know where we got them. I'll be shopping for other colors. Amazon delivery was fast and efficient. I remain a fan",1
5,love it:,1
2,Very cute.<br /><br />But after wearing for only about a month it started to tarnish and turn black.,0
5,They are comfortable and good looking!!!,1
3,Thought the mesh texture would help with the sweat but not really,0
3,Too big. Not flattering.,0
3,this one is definitely cheaper than the scratchmenot 24.95 plus 6 bucks for shipping mittens. That one also stretches a lot and tears easily.<br />This worked out well over the last 2 months. no rips. i think its still expensive considering the simple piece of clothing that it is and that it is for kids suffering from eczema,0
5,"I love this! Super cute and super comfy! The material is soft and I love the pockets. I ordered it in navy and it is very flattering. I am a tall woman, though, so for petite women, this would probably be a bit too long. I'm ordering it in other colors!",1
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!,1
4,The bags are OK for small jewelry. Many colors in The same packet. Quality is OK for this prices . Good for earing,1
3,"the heart stone is gorgeous, but the necklace part is lacking. it is adjustable, but never stays in place after you adjust it.  I will be getting a different strand for the heart.",0
5,Lovely earrings! Very pleased!,1
3,"Looks gorgeous, tons of compliments, but turns green (along with your ears) within days.",0
5,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.  It was to accompany a new microscope and accessories.  We all love it and it is a great hit. Even though it was purchased as &#34;a toy,&#34; I was very impressed at the degree of quality -- it looks very professional!  It came pressed and nicely packaged and we appreciated that attention to detail that so obviously went in to every aspect of the design and distribution of this product.",1
5,Not only are they great fitting and warm.  I love being able to use my touch screen phone without having to take my gloves off!,1
3,"Runs small in shoulders dosen't completely close in front, nice quality for price. BUTTONS are tiny will not carry weight of cape, will have to widen button holes and larger button. Attracts stuff but nice.",0
4,niece loved it and fit great,1
5,Love this,1
5,"Very nice top!  Good fit, true size large, 14-16.<br />Nice feeling material, pretty design.",1
5,"I like the high pile fleece (like sherpa) lining that is everywhere, including the sleeves and pocket, and like that it is a pullover ... no zipper to fuss with. I ordered a second one in a different color. The only thing I would have preferred was a knit waist band to keep it tight at the bottom.",1
5,"Beautiful, do be aware of the CZs on the bale, which are slightly gold-toned and go really strikingly with two-tone charms... Lovely!",1
3,Extremely wide glasses.  So if you have a skinny face you may not like these.  Other than that the seemed high quality.,0
3,Gets lose from use. Xprin brand is better .,0
5,Loved for my 4yo who is tall for her age. Fits all her dolls / stuffed animals well,1
5,I got these shoes to take on vacation next month.  I wasn't sure how much &#34;breaking in&#34; i would need before the trip.  The leather is really nice and I didn't need to break them in at all.  They will be my new summer shoe for sure!,1
4,"I love how this top looked and the sizing was as expected. However, the material reminded me of a plain t-shirt. It wasn't thick enough for this type of top in my opinion.",1
5,Great üëç,1
1,Size is horrible. Fits around waist but giant in groin area. Order multiple sizes to try on and none fit well.,0
3,The dress was too small but it's really cute,0
5,This dress is so cute! I am absolutely in love with it. I'm not really a dress kind of person but I did it for a Donald Duck Disneybound and it kept me nice and cool on a hot day. Might actually wear this as normal wear too because its so comfortable.<br /><br />Amazon recommended me a medium and I wasn't sure about that since I'm usually a large in any female clothing but the dress is pretty stretchy at the back. It was a little tight at the chest for my liking but that's probably just cause I wear baggy clothes a lot.,1
1,Doesn‚Äôt fit well at all,0
1,Ordered 5 only got 3 too small,0
3,It fits over suitcase handle nicely. Can become bulky quick by placing items in it. Bag itself is heavy without items in it.,0
3,The quality was okay.,0
3,Son muy duras para el pie del beb√© y no parecen tan abrigadas.,0
5,Very soft and feels secure. I was afraid it might come off easily but very happy with this band and I get a lot of compliments,1
5,"Since the dog chewed up my son's first pair, I was pleased to find a replacement pair that was actually better than his first! These are sized for a child, and the tips are rounded, not sharp. He loves them and I have peace of mind. Win win! Thanks so much!!",1
2,It was a little too small for me,0
3,"These are very small.  Keep that in mind before ordering!  Colors are pretty.  I ordered the navy, dark pink set.",0
5,More beautiful then on picture and perfect size.,1
1,Sizing and measurements are off. Sizing chart was not accurate. I ordered one size up since it‚Äôs China made and I assumed it would be incorrect. It was still too small. Material is flimsy thin with no lining. May not work for those with sensitive skin or want a better quality dress. Definitely overpriced for what it is. Returning this one.,0
3,The lens arnt dark enough,0
5,Beautiful! I bought it for my husband and for gifts!,1
5,Sturdy and attractive,1
5,I love these. They actually stay on my foot. I can wear my ballet flats or Tom's and they stay hidden and on. I will be buying more of these for sure. Quality is decent. They may not last as long as some but for the price you can't beat it.,1
2,"Did exactly what the instructions said, but didn‚Äôt make my yeezys waterproof. Accidentally spilt beer on them and it just soaked right in.",0
2,These would not stay up on my face over my nose! The fabric is way too silky.,0
2,Flowers look off white. shoes are soft and wide.,0
1,Feel apart,0
4,"Too slippery on the bottom of the shoe, a little heavy in weight on the soul, however it's a nice looking shoe.",1
5,Great kicks!,1
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money. The top felt like a swimsuit material. It looked nothing like the picture and the small looked like it could fit a medium. It looked awful,0
1,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he will never wear it. It‚Äôs the worst material of a shirt ever (‚Äúheavy cotton‚Äù is too nice of a description). Don‚Äôt waste your money on this!,0
5,Ball is secure. Very cute. Nice quality and coloring.,1
4,"My daughter loves this dress and so do I!  It‚Äôs so cute and adorable, with enough detail to make it stand out from the costumes sold in stores.  The fabric is soft and shimmer with some movement.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the pants to come with the dress were too big.  No way would the size of the dress be for a little girl that could wear those pants.  They are supposed to fit like tights but are super baggy and long.",1
5,Looks awesome,1
5,Just what he needed. These fit great,1
5,Unfortunately the size I ordered was too small. I put in to return for a refund and was refunded immediately. Hopefully another size will fit because it is a super cute skirt.,1
5,great value,1
5,Amazing watch!,1
3,"It's very thin, and a silky material.  I wouldn't wear it to work.",0
1,Was small I wear a large bought a extra large and still very small,0
5,"My son loves his new lab coat. He is a skinny 8 year old. I bought the 10/12 size. He has to roll up the sleeves and it fits big around, but that is what I wanted. Now he can wear it for a couple of years. The fabric and design are great. This is not a cheap costume.",1
4,"There is nothing wrong, persay, about this cardigan, I just had expectations that were not quite what this is.  First I was expecting a light-weight cotton sweater, this is more of a t-shirt material.  Okay, I can adjust to that.  It's not quite as long as the photos, but I'm tall (5'11"") so I won't knock stars off for that.  It is a bit more brown than I expected.  There's green, brown and black in it.  That threw me a bit, so I did leave a star off for all of those things together.  I did find it true to size.  Altogether, not a bad wrap/cardigan, just not exactly what I expected.",1
5,So fun,1
2,"Husband enjoyed,it but this,looks nothing like the pic. Completly see through which is ok but I expected it to look like the pic. Also the cut is in the middle not over to the side with ruffles cheaply made but served its,purpose I feel it was a waste of money not planning on wearing again.disappointed to say the least.",0
5,My grandson lives everything about these pj‚Äôs!,1
5,Beautiful shorts!!,1
1,I love this item,0
2,"I ordered one each of Light, Moderate and Firm Support in the large size. The Firm Support socks are two inches longer from heel to top than the Light and Moderated Support socks.  I have returned the Firm Support socks.",0
3,"It's nice, but over priced",0
5,My friend loves this item. It‚Äôs great to work out in. You don‚Äôt feel restricted and the color selection is great.,1
1,Waaaaaay too small. Doesnt stretch at all either. Im 5'2&#34; 100 lbs and a medium was too small. Not worth the return.  Just gonna trash it.,0
2,"It's a pretty earring but it is way too large to fit my cartilage. I thought it would be lighter and smaller, but it is large and heavy. I don't recommend buying this, the price isn't worth the disappointment.",0
1,"Nor sure if the company decided to cut corners due to the lightening deal, but definitely had to high expectations set on this garment. The supposed ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù is thin as paper and you might as well be outside naked as a newborn. The seams do not line-up as they should and the finished off edges which are supposed to help the garment maintain itself have definitely been rushed and have strands hanging in multiple places. Luckily for myself i can go it and re-do the seems and whatnot properly. The product pictures definitely portray an item of more quality and attention to detail‚Ä¶NOT what I received.",0
2,"Bought a 3X, fits way too small.",0
1,It came in tarnished. It appeared Copper and steel and only one side of the ball was beaded.,0
3,too tight around the neck. I had to get my scissors out,0
1,"So disappointed! Upon opening the package, I noticed holes in the fabric.",0
5,I bought these for my 8 year old and 10 month old for NASCAR. They are AMAZING! My 10 month old didn't even flinch during the green flag.,1
5,"I love sunglasses, I never leave home without them.  For summer and for sports, I like having lots of colors of wayfarers to choose from, and these are cute and well made. And what a great deal for this price!",1
1,TERRIBLE!! Thinner than a T-shirt. Ordered white and received this flimsy dingy grey looking crap. Unbelievable. This is being returned immediately.  I wish I could 0 stars,0
5,"This purse is not as well made as my other Michael Kors hand bags. I have purchased five Michael Kors Ciara Totes. The last three Ciara Totes were disappointing. The first two were great.  The style is nice, they hold a lot but the quality has declined. I'm no expert but I wonder if the last three are real Michael Kors bags. I depend on Amazon to ensure my purchases are not counterfeit.",1
2,They fit great and feel nice but you can definitely see your butt when you turn around and look in the mirror.,0
5,Love them,1
4,"I like the product and it fulfills what I need. I always have cold feet. The heated socks keep my feet warm. I mainly wear the socks at home with medium or low setting.  The battery can last long enough. The socks are perfect for me to use at home.  I don‚Äôt know how comfortable if wearing the socks for a long walk, jogging or work-out since I can feel the wire that connects the heating pad.",1
5,this was a gift. It is very bright and cheerful.  well worth the money for a bracelet or even if you wanted to use the beeds for another project. My niece really likes it alot!,1
5,It fit my three year old perfect item came as described,1
1,I bought this in navy and it fits perfectly but this one is double the size and the seller didn't let me return the item.,0
3,It did come unglued after a few days but can be fixed.,0
1,If your built like a twig site you‚Äôll fit just fine. But if you have hips don‚Äôt buy.,0
3,"I ordered this based on the sellers measurements. Based on their sizing chart I was in between sizes from medium to small. I ordered the small, however it was just too large. Also, the color is off from the pictures. Even the pictures show two different shades of color.",0
2,"Not worth it. I received this, took a good look at it and sent it back. The inner material appeared so flimsy that I had doubts it would hold up carrying my iPhone more than a months use. Very cheap material.",0
5,It was a gift for my goddaughter and she loves it!,1
1,Cheaply made. Do not buy.,0
5,"I ordered this dress for my mom to wear to my wedding. I was skeptical at first but we got exactly what is seen on this sight. It fit her perfectly! When she tried this dress on, her eyes lit up with joy. I would recommend this company to my friends and family definitely.",1
4,These joggers are extremely comfy to lounge in. They also look as pictured and fit as expected. Overall i am pretty impressed with the product. Matieral is good quality but could be softer on the inside.,1
5,Very helpful and lots of fun. The case was very helpful.,1
5,I bought these for my youngest granddaughter to wear through the Christmas season. She wore them quite often. They washed wonderfully as well.,1
1,I returned this. The cups have a rigid padding that makes a weird shape so it doesn‚Äôt look good with any clothing.,0
2,Kind of small,0
1,"Photo and description indicate long, however, I received a short dress.",0
1,"Absolute cheapest, most terrible workout pants ever. More like cheap costume pants. Huge disappointment since I ordered three! Yuck!",0
3,"The necklace I received was much smaller than I thought. That being said, the necklace is still cute, I'll still find something to wear it with.",0
4,"Nice material, very pretty pattern. a little bit too snug for my head.",1
4,Runs a bit small.,1
2,"It's a cool design, but the rubber rings that surround the earrings keep falling off.  I just took them off completely, but they just don't look that great without them.",0
3,Cute but they were bent when they arrived,0
1,cinturon de pesima calidad se pelo en la primera postura,0
2,"Well, not very durable. About half develop holes under the arm after one wearing. The black color version is even worse. I would like to get a few washings out of these before tossing them. Alas, mais non. Two stars.",0
5,I LIVE IN THESE THINGS.,1
4,Cool idea not the best quality,1
4,slit in the back a little high but excellent quality material,1
1,I did not like this dress.The cut and the cinch are just awkward. I requested a refund-but this item comes out of China so they don't want it back. They offered my 50% refund and I keep the dress. :-/,0
5,Good quality and nice price!,1
3,Very cute but it is exactly the same as the Drogon keychain I had except for the paint.,0
3,These are really pretty but two of the posts bent pretty easily,0
5,"Keeps out bright lights, dark like sunglasses on the top and the Gradient grey/light on the bottom. Works perfect for my alter ego!",1
5,Bought them for my bother n he says they comfy,1
1,"Looks nothing like the picture at all.... horrible, no scallop on the bottom of the shorts",0
2,The dress was beautiful and I loved the material. The red color was vibrant and true to picture. I did return the dress because there was a 4-5 inch tear at the side seam and I don‚Äôt buy defective merchandise.,0
1,This was poorly made and looked cheap,0
5,"Great color combination, goes with everything. Not as bulky as some.",1
3,"thick cheap looking, not the nicest piece I have seen, disappointed in this piece, will not use as a necklace, may put somewhere else.",0
5,2 for price of one. Great product and deal!,1
5,"Love this sweater! Seriously, I seldom, if ever write a review but want to let other shoppers know that this sweater is pure quality and fit. In Virginia we just had a snowstorm and this sweater kept me warm, doesn't itch and has a very modern look and fit. I liked it so well, I bought the black and white one. At 5'2 and with a much more mature figure for gals pushing 60, the xl works for me. I wanted a looser and roomier fit but if I had gone to a large it would also work ...again... I like a roomy tunic length fit. Style wise, I would expect to see this style, and have, in neiman marcus and McLaughlin at a significantly higher price. It arrived really fast, three days and again....divine!",1
5,Perfect üíô,1
1,It is bulky .. In addition to fabric was poor quality‚Ä¶,0
1,"To be clear, any sponge mask is ineffective and going to be a thin membrane. However, I have scenarios in which I need to wear a mask all day but am outside and not around anyone. I had ordered sponge masks in bulk because they are the most comfortable and was unable to order again so I chose these because they have a similar description of material and price point. These are not sponge. They are an inflexible almost canvas material that is slick on one side and scratchy on the other. They are extremely uncomfortable and clearly made in a facility that processes or produces paint. The seams are uneven and sloppy. These are terrible and not worth the money or true to description.",0
3,Shoulder strap (the metal latch) broke after about 60 seconds of use. Otherwise nice duffel.,0
3,Not the material I expected but my fault for not reading description.  Still like. Little big for me,0
5,"This patch from Mil-Spec Monkey is a great addition to any 24-hour pack or MOAB pack.  I like the construction of the patch, the threading feels smooth and the lines of the design are clear and well-drawn.  And it's a bulldog- best dog face in the world.",1
2,"They fit okay, but my butt is too big, so they go up it. Also the button hole wasn‚Äôt cut open. Would have had to return them anyway.",0
4,It fits great - but A LOT shorter than I expected!,1
1,I only received one sweatshirt while they said both were feliveref,0
2,"Is there a nice way to say that these made me look like a dragonfly? no? oh, well, okay. Sorry. These made me look like a human-sized dragonfly.",0
5,Looks good.Just what I wanted.,1
3,I wear a lot of different types of arm warmers to wear under scrubs but these would not stay up my full shift. I like the feel of them but I won‚Äôt be usuing them during my shift anymore,0
5,I was so pleased with the quality of these socks. The stitching is excellent. They are a great value for the price.,1
5,"Comes in a cute case, dont irritate my toddlers ears. They dont get snagged on clothes or towels and they are super pretty!",1
5,"I love these. They're light enough that I can barely even notice I'm wearing them. I had other earrings before this that I didn't end up keeping cause they were so heavy.<br /><br />They're very shiny, but its from the way they're cute, not any crappy glitter that would rub off onto anything. Beautiful. I did have to order a second pair and return the first one because the clasp was slightly messed up (it appeared to be a manufacturing defect), but I didn't have any problems. Second pair is beautiful. The cut is so beautiful and detailed! I'm wearing these everyday.",1
5,Comfortable perfect sizing,1
5,Slight large for a size small. Very comfortable !,1
4,"This is a stylish and comfortable tank, I'm used to racing tops and they are much lighter and thinner,  this one just seemed too hot to run in. But great fit.",1
5,"I should have bought more, great fit!",1
5,Love this,1
5,Good i like it very much thanks!!,1
2,Shirt fit fine except it is much shorter than shown in picture.,0
4,Got delivered to my work n I put them on and got tons of compliments ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ they look good with black hair,1
1,The black is straight black! Not like the heathered look in the picture. The sleeves were huge and unflattering to my arms and I'm normally a medium for length but it was just to big. It also looked like a fancy shirt rather than the casual look I was wanting.,0
4,I love this shirt. It was used as my son‚Äôs senior shirt for the first day of school.  He felt good wearing it. Thank you for helping me make him happy.,1
1,I place an order for a small and they send me a large not once but twice<br />I returned it for good not worth the money.,0
5,Love it,1
4,"I really loved this pendulum but unfortunately it broke pretty early for me and don't understand how but it's an amazing item and gorgeous to look at. Also with it's copper slivers, it's fantastic for dowsing!",1
5,Good,1
2,"I find this to be &#34;just OK&#34; in terms of costume-ish jewelry. It really bugs me that the &#34;turquoise&#34; (NOT authentic as incorrectly reported in the above Answered Question...) is NOT graduated evenly: one side is laid out more straight and nicely uniform, whereas the other lies at an angle. Pictures #1 and #5 in the slide show are accurate representations of what I received.<br /><br />If you're slightly OCD and/or big on symmetry, you might want to skip it. I'm debating whether or not it's worth my time to send it back, as I paid about 15% of the listed price.",0
5,I love these! They are super comfortable and look really cute!<br />They don't ride up and they don't slip down. I will be ordering more,1
5,Great fit!!,1
5,Shirt is very nice and great quality!,1
2,I was hoping for a better fit. But it was slightly short and snug and itchy... Definitely wear under shirt,0
5,"Product was just as expected, was delivered promptly.  Used it for vacation and am very pleased with the bag.",1
4,Material is too thin,1
1,It broke while wearing it I throw it out,0
5,Nice ring,1
3,"I loved this purse. I used it for a cosplay but liked it so much that I started using it every day. However the clips for the cross body strap broke on each end, like the actual metal clip broke. The clips aren't strong enough if your purse becomes heavy. I stored a coin purse with lots of quarters in the purse and that is probably what did the clips in.",0
1,Off white color. Panties are huge. Just not what I expected. Not happy with product.,0
5,very soft and well made!!!  Great purchase!!,1
2,"The elastic band in this dress made the dress fit awkwardly on me. I returned the dress because of this. The material was soft and I loved the color, but I just didn‚Äôt love how it fit.",0
5,It is a good costume glasses. Very big.,1
2,"Cut very short otherwise would have been nice but I can‚Äôt wear it it‚Äôs not no comfortable it‚Äôs almost like a crop top, not a long fit like shown",0
1,It looks so much better in the pictures. poorly made and lasted me a few weeks. Don't buy if you want what you paid for,0
5,How can you beat this deal?  A typical drug store would be charging $15 or more.  Good product and an excellent deal.,1
5,"My favorite ring I‚Äôm always getting compliments, perfect for minimal people.",1
3,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful. So pretty that I bought a second pair after I lost one from the first pair.  The closures on the first pair were a little off. One was too tight and the other was too loose.  The second pair was a bit better but the closure still popped open and I had lost another one.<br />Yes, I made sure they were latched properly.  I loved these earrings.  Unfortunately I can‚Äôt continue to keep purchasing a pair to replace one.  If the closures wouldn‚Äôt be an issue, I‚Äôd give them 5 stars.",0
5,great great great,1
5,"Esta bonito, me quedo un poco largo de lo demas perfecto!",1
5,I have mid back length sisterlocks. Fits snugly and stays on at night. I will usually wear a satin scarf underneath.  Stylish enough to ear outdoors.,1
3,"I have an average size wrist, but this band was too short.  I removed the clips with no problem, I then spent the next couple hours trying to put them back into the added links.  Each time I held the clip with nettle nose pliers or tweezers, before I could get it into the link, it would pop across the room The guy on uTube said if you have ever done this before, you'll never do it again.  He's right, next time, I'll pay a pro to lengthen it (or try to find one the correct length to begin with).",0
1,"Its described as sweats, its a very thin silky material.",0
1,The plastic is cheap and the screws wouldn‚Äôt go in far enough to secure the band.,0
2,not for a newborn,0
4,It's a lovely mala. The vendor kindly restrung it without the silver pieces for me. I do wish the main bead were a little nicer. I still recommend this and love the vendor. I wear it a lot both as a necklace and as a bracelet.,1
3,Just ok. Runs big and material is hot.,0
1,"This does not look like the colors, nor the material presented in the picture. Also Material looks very cheap. Very disappointed.",0
3,"Like it's design,soft,and compact. Just too pricey for something that is not true quality. You could find something like this a dollar store.",0
1,I lost one the first hour I wore the earrings...hook no long enough & very light in weight,0
2,Thin material.,0
5,The color is very vibrant<br />Gorgeous piece,1
3,Fogs up and makes you feel like you can not breathe.,0
1,The size runs small and they are bent.,0
1,Snag material . It's from China would not purchase !,0
5,"I was concerned when I purchased this set because the price was so low but I needed tie clips fast. I am really happy I did. The clips are firm and hold my tie all day. They haven't warn out at all, the colors are still as new now as They were almost two months ago when I bought them and I wear one 6 days a week at work. If the colors ever end up fading of they wear put I will purchase these again. I highly recommend this product.",1
1,"Terrible, the nose mounts were mounted to the frame at least 2/8 off from each other, they sat lobsided.",0
1,"In the picture it appeared gold but once I received it, it was like Bart Simpson yellow and much, much smaller than expected. Would not recommend buying from here.",0
5,[[VIDEOID:60c06b3e697d7de61961ad3401ad7ec7]] Beautiful for the price,1
5,Soooo soft! This is so much nicer than expected and it isn't too short either!,1
4,"The only reason why Im not giving this pendant 5 stars is because the scarab had some sort of residue... but everything else was perfect... the details, weight and packaging were just perfect. I would be nice that it included a chain, it has been difficult to find a matching chain.",1
2,"After reading a lot of positive reviews, I was disappointed in this purchase.  Positives: warm, moisture & windproof, length was good - I wore them for a dog sledding trip in the -20 & below windchill temps, knees held up to rough use. Negatives: the zipper broke within 12 hrs even with a good fit over one layer of pants, the zippers on the pockets also broke during the 4 day trip & I lost my favorite pocketknife.  The fit was weird - the crotch was a little long, the thighs were a little tight, but the waist was ok.  Definitely did not hold up to normal use. My Farm & Fleet cheap snow pants have lasted 3 yrs, these didn't even last 2 days intact.",0
5,Very nice quality. Silky material and fits true to size and flowy at the bottom.  I am 5‚Äô5 and 125 Lbs and ordered a small In the black. Perfect top for the office.,1
3,It's ok. Nothing special.,0
5,"I've been wearing it every day, spinning it like a madwoman.  It's a great ring and I really love it.  Perfectly true to size.  The blue color is very nice and shiny, and like I said, I've worn it every day since I got it, and no scratches or damage, and I'm pretty tough on things.  To be honest, it was very inexpensive, so I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised.",1
4,very nice.,1
1,"Ok, yeah its 7 bucks. But, I'm pretty sure I've seen dollar store rings that look nicer. It looks nothing, like the picture and the engraving is totally illegible. I got this for my daughter so she could read it. Well that was made pointless. If you looking for a cheap ring with owls and don't care one bit if it looks like the picture then go for it, but if you were even thinking of getting it for one tiny aspect of what you see in the picture don't bother.",0
3,Shirt quality is ok. The sleeves were a little too short.,0
5,Great material,1
5,"It's cute, my son loves it.  Just a bit bigger than expected.",1
5,perfect for my little girl,1
4,"Love these. They have pickets, but they are quite long. Wold be a great pair for a tall man.",1
2,It‚Äôs nice but It‚Äôs kinda Korny I have it too my kid.,0
1,"The first pair I grabbed and put on were very comfortable, but unfortunately the other 2 pairs were for a large right foot and small left foot.  They were so comfortable that I just got a replacement, and then all 3 of those pairs were uneven.  Very disappointing.",0
1,"The size I ordered was a xxl. It fits like a medium. I would not recommend this item. The quality of the sweat shirt is terrible. Thin, hard material and aWay too small.",0
3,"I enjoy bracelets as an accessory to my wardrobe. It was nice to find a bulk deal on bracelets. Although these items are cute, I didn't find that they last very long. I may be tough on jewelry however. A lot of these felt lightweight and delicate. They were pretty, fashionable, and did serve their purpose. I just wish they would have lasted a bit longer and been better quality for me.",0
5,My 13 year old son loves these glasses and receives many compliments wearing them.,1
5,"Gorgeous colors, boyfriend loved it! What else can I say?!",1
4,"Socks are good, just have to get used to the feel of them between the toes.",1
1,Just opened it to use it snd the steaks to the bag are broken.  üòüdefinitely renders this unusable for<br />Today.,0
2,Doesn‚Äôt have the same fitted look that the picture shows. I was pretty disappointed overall and never bothered wearing it.,0
4,"I really like this necklace, the dove /pigeon is brilliantly shiny against the skin, and a good size (not too tiny).<br />The (other) round gem attached is nice, however because these 2 pendants are not freely moving on the chain, the round piece can throw the dove off center at times....I think due to weight competition.",1
2,I don't know why but they keep sliding down,0
5,great quality for the costume party,1
4,"I like it, but order a size up. I thought it would be true to size and it's tight on my boobs. Ordered a medium as a 36 C and I'm pretty sure my boobs are going to break it",1
5,Love this dress.  I‚Äôm curvy and typically a size 12 or 14 and I got an extra large so that it would not be tight and I could wear it to work or church.,1
5,My son loves it!,1
5,I messed up on size but it's such a nice belt. Rich leather. Sharp buckle. Loved that they included the info sheet on nikel allergies. Right now I'm just trusting it's nickel free as my son's belly rash isn't fully healed from the last belt... if he winds up having a reaction I'll edit.<br />Eta: accidently took belt out with recycling bin b4 kiddo ever wore it. :( no chance to see if it caused a reaction. It's now years later & I'm still mad at myself over it.,1
1,Doesnt work,0
1,"Horrible!  Cotton tee with orange outlined lightening bolt.  No glitter, not a sweatshirt!!  What a piece of junk and NOT what was offered.",0
3,The top part sits to high above the waste,0
2,Easily slip on and off...not that great for walking babies/toddlers.,0
5,"Regular, adjustable cap with a removable neck flap on the back to protect your ears and neck. The material is lightweight and UPF 40; will block 95.98% of the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.<br /><br />Because the flap is removable, you can wear the hat without the flap and use it as a breathable face mask.<br /><br />The hat is waterproof and windproof. It can also be folded for easy packing.",1
4,I bought this dress as a beach cover up. I‚Äôm 6ft tall and it comes up way too short to be an everyday dress. I like the material. I wish I had bought an xl. I am a size 12/14 and usually wear a large shirt.,1
1,"These are fake. Not only fake, a bad one, too. The lenses are distorted that you'd get a headache after 5 minutes of wearing it. It's also super light like plastic.",0
5,I love it. Just wish there was a way for it to stay up. It just keep falling off my nose. But I lovw it.,1
1,To small,0
1,No silver wires in package .Don't buy......,0
5,"Very nice. Haven't had an opportunity to wear yet because no rain, but this feels and looks very nice!",1
1,"The material and fit were okay BUT They forgot to sew the front and back together! See pictures attached, if I tried to wear this it would just fall off since it‚Äôs not properly made! Not as pictured! Super disappointed! Do not order this product it is defective! I will be returning it!",0
5,Love this shoe<br /> Comfortable perfect fit perfect higth,1
5,"These seem to be good quality, have held up through a few wash/dries and my son likes them! Cute design",1
2,"if you've got tiny arms and no curves, this might work for you. I don't have large arms in the slightest, but felt like I was putting on children's clothing while trying this on. The jacket also arrived wrinkled--but not in the way you'd expect. It almost seems as though the wrinkles are supposed to be a feature of the jacket? Returned.",0
5,"Son loved it, great design. Wish it was a little longer for a 10/12.",1
3,"It was a very nice watch band at first, it looked like leather, but then when it got wet it broke down the material quickly",0
3,"I was mainly interested in this set because it contains a 16g and 1g taper. Everything is about how you would expect, and was packaged/labeled nicely.<br /><br />However - although the first stretch was effortless and painless, the tunnels unfortunately did a number on my ears within a few hours. To be honest I kind of expected that would happen, given the price of the set, but I figured that since it was so cheap it was worth a try anyways. I'd stay away from this one if you have sensitive ears.",0
1,"The septum ring is supposed to be magnetic, however, it never stuck to my nose. It didn't work at all.",0
1,"This suit is cut and fit to perfection. I had to return because they only put lining on the front side of the suit‚Ä¶ and the white color, without lining on the back, means you can see everything (even when the shite suit is dry).",0
3,"Nice quality and look good, so I really wanted them to fit, but sadly did not. I typically wear normal shoe size 11.5 so for these I ordered both 12 and 13 (largest) sizes, due to reviews saying fit was slightly small.  I would argue more towards runs ""very"" small than slightly so... Couldn't even get my foot into the 12, and while I could with the 13 my toes were cramped to the end, so returning both and looking elsewhere.",0
5,"Beautiful, sturdy necklace",1
4,Its a nice size to fit in small gym lockers. It looks small but holds a lot.,1
5,Sturdy & exactly what I expected,1
5,"I really like them. I sleep in them and they do not bother me like regular socks do. I wear them with my toe sandals and they are extremely comfortable. I like the material they are made of, soft and smooth.",1
2,Cheap looking,0
5,"best over wear glasses , looks good and it's light. like it.",1
5,My daughter loved it. She wore it to comic con as Agent Carter. Really liked the fabric. Comfortable and stretchy and holds its form.,1
1,"These look really nice in the pictures but they are not very pretty in person. The enamel is a mess all over the pendents, smudged, bleeding into other colors, and faded in some spots. I also did not get many of the pictured pendents and I got multiples of the same ones.",0
4,Exactly like pictured,1
5,"I really like this bracelet. I bought it because of the engraved saying, and even though the black ink in the writing is wearing off, you can still read the writing. The arrows didn't fade and I am very impressed with the fact that the color on the bracelet itself didn't fade or cause my skin to discolor. I NEVER take it off. Love this!",1
5,good purchase,1

2,"We lost the kids masks up until we started looping them around their necks.  As for me, I was constantly walking up to the store and realizing I left my mask in the car.  So now, I hang it around my neck and I'm always ready to go.<br /><br />CONS: the hook is a bit hard for the kids to manage on their own & the material is stiff so it curls up as of it needs to be unwound. Would not buy again.",0

3,I ordered this bathing suit for my annual FLA Keys trip. It was cute but the bottom fit very snug around the legs. I  not a big woman and ordered a large. The fit was ok except for the bottom. The holes also left me with tan lines that looked like the bathing suit. The suit is made very well and I like that the hunter tied.,0
3,"After snipping the net to loosen the wig it looks fine but it was rather small, a good costume wig but not for everyday wear or realism",0
5,It's become my favorite little chain! I absolutely love it!üòç,1
3,I expected softer more fluid drape and it‚Äôs stiff and cheap fabric.,0
4,"The hat is nice, not real flimsy.  But it is HUGE!  Definitely not a women's hat and was even big on my husband who normally wears a size large hat.  Not sure if I got a different hat than some of the reviewers but this straw hat with the black band was way too big.  Had to return.",1
5,love itüíúüíúüíú,1
5,"Exelente material , amo este producto",1
5,Lovely band!  But too early too determine how fast or stable the color is.  And too early to see if the mesh will fray and stick me.  Which often happens with mesh bands.,1
5,excellent even though they are made in china.,1
2,Not true to size to small,0
5,Our son loved this gift. He is hard to buy for and he played with this for hours on Christmas Day,1
5,These masks are one of the best items I‚Äôve ever purchased on Amazon. I love the thickness and comfort of the masks. The filter pocket makes this item a fantastic purchase. I hope they develop some extra large masks soon! Thank you Xchime! üôè,1
5,"This set works great, but does run a little small.  I'd recommend ordering a cup size up.  I wear a C cup but these were too small for me in a C.<br />Otherwise they are great to have on hand for those tips where a bra just won't cut it.  Still sticky and holds on great after repeated uses. I have worn with both formal wear and casual tops where a bra just can't be worn and it works great in all scenarios.  Does give lots of cleavage if desired.  I make sure to wash and store per the instructions to extend their longevity.  Arrived in a handy zippered case which I kept and store them in when not in use.",1
1,I love the size of the Cross and the chane but very very horrible quality it tarnished after a week and my husband used did not even take a shower with it or anything and the whole thing turned black. I would like refund,0
1,I wanted to like this dress but it was touching the ground and I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù. The bust was too tight also.,0

5,"I am an avid CrossFitter and I have a drastic angled bob that I love..I am not willing to give up either lol! My problem is my hair style does not allow for me to be able to pull my hair back and clips are just not strong enough to hold for an entire WOD so I am forever looking for headbands that actually work! This one is awesome, bullet pointed below are my favorite features...<br />-legitimately stay on my head and in place<br />-the back does not ride up<br />-the fabric is soft and stretchy but lightweight and breathable<br />-fits snug on the head<br />-fashionable enough to wear outside of the gym, the knot in the front is super cute<br />-sides can be worn over the ear to keep warm in the winter or behind the ear to stay cooler<br />This headband truly works for when your working out. I promise I have tried all different kinds out there and these rank at the top. Having short hair is great cause it stays off my neck and helps keep me cool but the long pieces in the front are just a pain and in the way. I will most def be recommending these to my fellow gym ladies.<br />I ordered this headband at a discounted rate for an honest and accurate review.",1
1,"The shoe looks like a real Nike shoe, but once you touch it, it's all down hill. The material is man made; there are no markings on the tongue; the stamps inside don't match and one is placed very off center. There should be a SKU inside the shoe that matches the box. Not! The label that is inside doesn't say &#34;Nike,&#34; it says &#34;MADE IN VIETNAM&#34; in all caps. Our family has been through dozens of Nikes through the years and these are clearly fakes.",0

4,As expected cute looked a little vintage not clean silver coated wore them out to dinner can't really see them but only pic I had I got the matching choker also,1
1,Way too small. Should of sized up. My son is 8 months old and this did not fit him,0
5,Excellent product,1
4,Basic Tshirt. Decals look like they will hpld up in the wash.,1
5,I used them as tie tacks for my serving job and they work perfectly. The only problem I've had is some of the backs work better than others and will fall off.,1
4,"I bought a large and I'm glad I did because it fit my 5'3&#34; 125lb body. Be advised that this dress is short! It's short in length and a tiny bit in arm length too. I wore it for cosplay but I'd be hesitant to wear it in the real world. I still think it's well made dress, similar to quality of what you would find in forever 21. The material is soft, vibrant in color, and not thin. It did not fall apart (but did pill a little) even though I wore it 4 days in a row for about 11 hours each time.",1
3,I wasn't totally disappointed in the scarf but I got it thinking it faded greenish/blue. It does not. its blue. just beware if you think it fades into colors this one does not. shipping and cost were great. Seller response was fast and easy. thank you.,0
1,Chain broke as I tried to put it on. Globe broke when I was trying to fix chain.  Never even got to wear it. Boo. :-(,0

1,"I purchased a 24"" Milano chain in gold through 'Roma Jewelry.  It arrived with a knot and it was too thin to support my pendant.  I have written to the company twice,  called 3 times and have never received a reply.  Never able to connect with a person.  BEWARE",0
2,"Cute but they're big, bulky and heavy.",0
1,"Tarnished beyond cleaning... Cute charm, but worthless.",0
4,"I really like this skirt... BUT the material differs between colors. The yellow skirt is a crepe material that falls nicely over the hips, but the red skirt is paper thin and stiff. It does not drape; it looks like a triangle on my body. I'm returning the red but I like the yellow. For reference, I bought a medium, I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs.",1
3,Most of them work perfect but the 17/19mm the one I would use the most cracked immediately on the first use. The rest of them have served me done.,0
3,"Cute, though made a little cheaply and a bit pricy ($69), was made to my specifications",0
5,Fits perfect,1
4,I wear 16 but purchased 2x and fit perfectly.  Came down right to hip as I needed.,1
4,"Soft and well fitting, except a little too low cut for my taste.",1
5,I love these...they are so cute and you don't have to worry about losing the backs.,1
2,"The hangover glasses are Ray-Ban Aviator 3025, but you can not get them in the red tinted color anymore.<br /><br />these sunglasses are fun to wear and comfortable. they also come with a drawstring bag to protect them.<br /><br />they are quite LARGE but that makes them more fun. they are good to wear when goofing around with your friends. check the dimensions to<br />make sure these are the right glasses for you.<br /><br />my lenses are very red. everything is very intense and you can see better with them while driving. i am able to make out green lights but yellow lights are a bit strange colored.<br />its like they improve your vision. i can see every individual LED on a car's stop lights or on traffic lights.<br /><br />they're good glasses if you intend on looking a bit wild. they are ""elvis sized"".",0
5,"I love this dress, it's really just so pretty.  Looks as pictured and is even nicer than I expected.  Flowy, light, pretty, elegant.....what more could a girl ask for in a dress!  I an 8/10 and so ordered it in medium.  It's a little snug around the waistband but only a little - I think a large would have been too big elsewhere.",1
5,"Great item, price and seller.",1
1,Looks are really deceiving. Uncomfortable feels like you're walking on the floor. One slipper broke in approximately 5 days of wear. So disappointed. I would've been better off with a $3 slipper from a 99cent store.,0
2,"I was so excited to get these, but was very disappointed with how comfortable they were. Because of their weight and length, they were very bulky to wear and quickly became sore. Still very cute, but I wish I could actually wear them.",0
5,Very nice,1
1,"I bought this as part of my husband's birthday presents.  I don't think he likes it - he didn't say that, but he has yet to even try it on or wear it!  I don't know what the patch on the sleeve is for - it looks like Velcro, but it's not - don't know what it is.  Too late now to return it now!",0
1,"After only a few weeks, several small holes formed along one of the seams. They were very thin too. I bought another brand twice and they are thicker and are more durable.",0
5,Love it! Fit easily into my watch. Vibrant colors. Comfortable strap and easy clasp.,1
3,They sellers should really be ashamed of themselves. A 16 inch chain for an adult neck size is like choking yourself. My son ended up taking me to the jewelry store and purchasing a longer length. It should at least be 18 inches.,0
5,Very cute on. Warm like sweatshirt.,1
5,"Love these earings, they match the necklace I got at the SanDiago zoo perfectly.",1
5,"My wife is native Japanese.  She bought her first Charter Club nightgown at Macy‚Äôs in New York City, and ever since it has been her all time favorite.  She has bought at least seven over the last ten years.<br /><br />She‚Äôs been gushing about this one since she got it.  She loves the all cotton flannel and the seemingly tailored fit.  She looks like the prima ballerina in the Nutcracker in this thing.<br /><br />And forget Victoria‚Äôs Secret..  Frankly she looks cute and sexy and her Charter Club nightgowns.  These don‚Äôt look like granny pajamas from the Vermont Country Store at all, and yet they are apparrently as comfy.<br /><br />I should see if they sell men‚Äôs pajamas as well.",1
5,My wife loves the way they fit!,1
5,This tie looks amazing on with a suit. I got it for a get together. I love the quality of the fabric. It also was really easy to clean. I was worried that the washer might ruin it but it was fine. I just made sure to hang dry it.,1
1,not what I thought it was,0
2,"I checked and double checked the sizing chart against clothes I currently wear and my measurements, yet when the pants came in I couldn't get them past my calf. Also there was no stretch or give to the material, unlike what the description says, it was very stiff. I'm hoping I got a mislabeled pair, the sizing difference was terrible.",0
5,"These shorts are very comfortable and make time in the sun easier by eliminating the amount of sunscreen needed.  My daughter always burned near her bikini line, no matter how much sunscreen we applied.  PROBLEM SOLVED!",1
3,The shirt fits well on the stomach area but too loose on the chest and shoulders,0
2,"I find these quite ugly in person. Also, the color said tan but you can see on photo these are clearly gold. I also question whether they are truly polarized lenses. There is no curve at all to the lenses so a lot of sunlight gets in through the sides of the glasses. I do not think there are worth the price at all.",0
2,I didn‚Äôt love these bands like I thought I would. I ordered two. Snagged it a couple times the first day and the loops pull out. Plastic under the slide pokes my wrist. The silicone oem band is much more comfortable.,0
4,Would like to have another color.,1
1,The band comes undone very easily ‚òπ,0
4,The chain could have been a few inches longer. But the charm was eactly how I expetected! Thank you for this gift!,1

2,Works for a pinky ring....very small,0
3,"I like it ,very nice",0
4,Got some of the same pairs but loved overall,1
3,"I wanted to like this these shorts and the fit is great but the material is bizarre.  It is very thick yet stretchy, kind of reminds of swimsuit material but thicker?  I don't know how to explain it but they feel weird and cheap.  They wash well and they are very comfy but they just aren't for me.  They do run a little small, I ordered a medium and they fit well but smaller than most mediums do (I'm 5'6, 125 pounds, typically a size 2-4/26-27 for reference).  Overall they aren't bad just aren't for me.",0
2,This has two colors in it and the one color looks fake,0
2,I was hesitant to purchase with conflicting reviews. I did receive all the parts but it is too small. The seller left several comments on reviews saying it is true to size. Ut is not. Ladies order a cup size bigger.,0
5,"Lots of complements, love them.",1
2,"The product that was sent to me did not match the picture. The short were way to large, and they were made of low quality denim.",0
1,Hated the whole thing. Donated it to homeless shelter.,0
5,Cute t-shirt for my teenage daughter. She is an XS but wears a Small in this t-shirt,1
2,"I really liked the look of this piece, but it would not stay in one orientation. It would rotate on me and stick my ear or get stuck in my hair. I had to return this. It might have been better if the bar was not in the middle so it would stop rotating as much.",0
3,"Lovely pants, but sizing way off.  I'm a six, but couldn't even put these on.",0
3,The front of the coat is bulky and seams are not flat.,0
1,They are scratchy and smell bad even after a wash. I do not recommend even though the front is super cute.,0
5,"Not the way I pictured them, but made it right so the company in itself is good sometimes the sizes aren‚Äôt what you think if you wear a smaller gauge.",1
4,"Dress is a soft slinky material, not knit like I hoped, but still great. Fits a little big, but not baggy. Had pockets, adorable print and can't beat the price!",1
5,"My wife bought this and loves it. Good quality, fits great.",1
3,It was okay. It was a bday present.,0
1,Very cheap quality and  very small,0
3,"If you're looking for a Brandy Melville quality bralette, this isn't really it. It's alright at best. It feels a bit tight but it pretty much looks like the picture if that's what you're wanting. The padding inside is poor quality (very creased and lumpy) and a bit too big that it makes the top look a little awkward. The padding isn't very comfortable either and there's no way to remove it without cutting a hole.",0
2,"Nice looking, but tassel fell off within an hour of putting it on. Was left with just the gold necklace looking like a wannabe thug. Would not recommend.",0
1,Very flimsy ring that stretches out.  I returned this ring.,0
3,"Cheap, crown broke right away.  The gloves are cute!",0
2,not like picture,0
5,she loves it!  Used while ice fishing and it protects her beauty in these cold Wisconsin winds!  Her only complaint would be the color options.,1
5,Good for day to day workout with good deal. Recommended!,1
5,"These are the best goggles I have purchased so far. They are just as advertised, they don't leak or get foggy and are 100% UV protection so that it seems as if you are wearing sunglasses while in the pool.  The strap has a buckle so they can easily be put on unlike other that you have to put on over your hear and pull your hair plus they don't fit tight.  They come in a mesh like carrying bag with 2 different sized ear plug and a nose clip.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I did purchase this product at a free or discounted price for my honest review and I honestly stand behind my five star rating. This review is unbiased and I would state the same if I had paid full price for it. If you have found that my review has helped you make a decision, please click the yes button. Thank you.",1
4,Love it but took forever to get shipped to me,1
5,The fit is great and they have lots of good pockets. I put the helikon knee pad inserts into them and are really comfortable,1
4,"I like these shirt stays since they do not pull out leg hairs and are comfortable to wear for an entire shift.  The clips are strong and sturdy and grab the shirt and sock way better than one of the push through loop style clips (vanguard).<br />One set lasts me 9 months or so, and the only reason I need to change them out is that over time, as the clips on the bottom are exposed to perspiration, they begin to tarnish and transfer a rust-like stain to your skin.",1
2,These were so small for a size 12 foot that they cut off circulation on the top of my foot at the opening,0
5,Go Bubba!!!,1
3,very cute,0
5,I wore this to a Navy ceremony and it is gorgeous and a great cut as well as high quality.,1
5,Don't buy a size bigger than you think you need as they have quite a bit of stretch to them,1
1,Small,0
1,"I can't review this item, because I can't purchase it, because the adorable bag does not match the description. I'm hoping that the real description the accurate description describes this adorable bag that won't cost over $400!",0
5,Nice loose fit. Very comfortable dress.,1
1,crap,0
5,Great jacket!,1
5,I bought this as a gift for one of my cousins the material was a good quality bought an extra small the fit was good overall very satisfied,1
1,Not as described. It is a cheap black plastic case/bezel as other reviews show,0
5,Nice tote or boating,1
1,These earrings are pretty but came with prices of rubber as the backing? Seems like children‚Äôs jewelry and does not work due to the low quality backings.,0
3,THESE BOOTS ARE  NICE. I RECIEVED ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THE COLOR.,0
5,They are true to the picture. Very pleased,1
5,super cute!!!!!,1
2,Love this until I wore it the second time. Now the bottom of the zipper is very abrasive and I need to where bandaid to stop it. Okay product and just not for higher intensity workouts.,0
5,The best large and heavy beautiful,1
5,Like the size perfect size for me.,1
1,They were torn,0
5,Very cute cardigan. And the material looks high quality.,1
2,"Ordered a khaki. It looks much more pale than what is shown in the picture. It looks like the picture was taken through a dark filter. Needed a corduroy jacket so I am going to keep it, but not happy about deceptive advertisement.",0
1,Was way to small for normal key,0
3,Too short,0
5,Awesome,1
2,Cute but VERY poor quality,0

3,It arrived rather quickly. It's a nice case.,0
5,Great scarf. Soft and not itchy! I got black and brown to use for a trip to Colorado. Will be ordering more. Would definitely recommend!,1
2,"Belt works fine but has a weird smell to it, almost like old beets. Honestly feel like throwing it away.",0
5,"Well made, they fit well, and the optics are good. Had to put nose pads on them because they're so light. They feel different than plastic sunglasses. They feel oddly retro, like the 1920's. The box is cool, but it wasn't glued together so it's kind of a fail.",1
3,"The socks are nice, comfortable and fit well but they are NOT NO SHOW!  They actually come up quite high on the front and back of the foot, so they would show if worn with a classic espadrille.",0
5,Bigger then I thought but its perfect much nicer in person an it came earlier then they said it would,1
5,"Pictured is my favorite of the 3 necklaces, but all of them are so nice.<br />Turquoise is my favorite!<br />Years ago I was robbed and lost a lot of my collection of gorgeous pieces.  Slowly as I see ones that remind me of something I pick them up.  These caught my attention and they didn't disappoint!",1
1,This necklace is ¬¢‚Ç¨=¬¢‚Ç¨=¬¢¬∂|√ó‚Ç¨=. I dislike it because it makes when look white and nerdy when I want to roll with the gangsters,0
3,"Nice but could be better.<br /><br />Pros: These are super comfortable, nice and stretchy. The material is thick and soft. High waisted!<br /><br />They are squat approved. No issues with full range of motion.<br /><br />Cons: I ordered a size medium as per the size chart. I know I‚Äôm not a size 0-2, but I think a size small would have been better. These are even a little bit loose around the tops of my thighs. There is no butt lift for me either, guess my booty is too flat! Or again it could be the sizing issue. These are not tight on me at all. For reference, I carry my weight on my belly, hips and thighs. They are a little long, had to roll them up, but I‚Äôm short at 5‚Äô3‚Äù<br /><br />Overall, they‚Äôre not bad, perhaps I would have liked them more in a smaller size, but they‚Äôll work for yoga and strength training.",0
2,"Great for the shower and/or wet environment, very comfortable, but believe it or not, this flip flop sheds!!..leaving little black pieces of rubber all over my tile floors 2 sweep up..didn't bother to return, won't buy again or recommend..",0
3,There are NO toes!,0
5,This dress is amazing! Looks more expensive than it is! Hugged my curves perfectly. Usually I have a hard time finding the perfect form fitting dress but here it is! Very comfortable too. I highly recommend this dress.,1
3,"I bought these for a camping/hiking trip to Moab, UT. I ended up wearing all weekend as the other shorts that I ordered last minute ended up not fitting. When I first tried them on, I couldn‚Äôt believe how soft and comfy they were! Waistband was a little tight, but still wearable. The pockets are perfect for my phone or other items I want accessible during hikes. But these were just too good to be true. After 2 days of wear, the fabric started pilling in multiple places. Then after washing, threads started coming loose at the seams. I‚Äôll keep these for at home lounge or workout wear but wouldn‚Äôt order them again.",0
5,"I got the black metal version, in case they are all under the same listing.  This is the prefect compliment to the Gear Fit 2 for me.  I have reactions to the rubber bands, and leather tends to get an odor over time.  This band fits well, and if you use the link removing tool properly it works great.  The band still allows the GF2 to be charged on the stock charger as well.",1
1,Way too cheeky and the straps were too loose. Loved the scallop design though!,0

3,Cute hat. Runs a little small..,0
2,"Love the idea of this, but what I got seams like plastic .",0
3,"Good value for the price.  The fabric is a little too ‚Äúpolyestery‚Äù for me, but again good value.  Can‚Äôt expect super high quality fabric at this price.",0
5,Love,1
4,"This is a great shirt, but does run slightly small. I bought a Guess shirt almost exactly like it for 4 times the price. This shirt was as nice as the Guess but a bit smaller for the same size.",1
1,"This item already broken. I thought all I needed to do was use needle nose pliers to bend the loop around the disconnected piece. The metal was so soft it didn't remain connected. Upon closer look, I realized two of the rinestones were missing from the very front of the necklace. I had saved the necklace for a special occasion and was VERY disappointed to discover the state of the necklace. I will not be ordering more from this company.",0
3,"Description said Mens/boys ties. Should have removed the ""Mens"" part. These ties were at least 6"" shorter than my regular ties. I have to say that returning them for a full refund was easy.",0
2,"This is really pretty cheap and it doesn't have a clip to stay on the ear. It just has some metal you squeeze shut, it will eventually break. I'm not that happy with it.",0
4,"Daughter loves it, but everyone else thinks it is a giraffe......which is equally as cute!",1
1,"Doesnt stay on my ear! Hard to put on, and it wont stay on once i get it on. :-\",0
5,This is a great felt cover for card games.,1
2,This item broke the second time I went to put them on and is NOT ELIGIBLE for a return? I'm only giving two stars because they are so pretty.,0
5,"These really look sharp, and are such a fun design!",1
2,The lace on the arms is too tight and it does not flatter the bust are as in the picture. Can I return it?,0
1,Amazon suggested size 12 after ordering 11. Guess what! Too big!,0
5,Was a little apprehensive about this.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  It is large and might not work as well on a petite person.  Love the chain.,1
5,Love love the key chains very well made and will look great hanging in my 1989 F150 ishing Truck,1

2,Fits large. Returned!,0
5,As decribed. Got in time.,1
5,This product is outstanding.,1
5,"I am six kids in, so I know what I like and dislike about baby swim suits.  I LOVE the head to toe coverage and the full zipper is worth its weight in gold if you ever have to do a poolside swim diaper change.  I sized up, so it is loose enough that I hope to get 2 seasons out of it.",1
5,"Love everything about them. I got two of them, one each for 4 yr old and 6 ye old grand daughters. Cant wait for them to open them tomorow on Christmas day!",1
2,"The face of the watch is very nice but the strap is misleading, not at the same quality of the watch, and frankly makes it look cheap.",0
4,"The cap is just a little too big, but the material is very comfortable and soft. It works great at maintaining my girlfriends curls and she loves the stylish design.",1
3,The top shoulder part fits nothing like the picture.,0
3,Nothing special ..but pricewise ok,0
5,"I've lost count how many clothing items I have reviewed for this company but, I will say out of all this one is probably the prettiest with the satin underneath the lace/velveteen it's a very sensuous dress. I also was advised by the seller/designer to order up a size from my normal medium and I am glad I listened and got the large because it fits me perfectly. I am 5'5&#34; 116lbs my measurements are 36C-29-36 and this one fits me with a little wiggle room. It only has one side zipper which seemed a bit off to me but, honestly I think it's only the second dress I've owned that had a zipper on the side of the bodice that runs from under the arm just down to the waist. The weird part is the zipper was sealed off at the top so I'm not sure if that's a fluke or if that's how it's suppose to be. So I am not going to dock a star for it since I really don't know if that was the intent of the designer or not just be aware that this dress has to be put on over your head and there is not much expansion except for the gap the side zipper will give you to pull the dress over your breast. I haven't done the video for it yet but I'll try to remember to show that and explain a little bit better what I mean.  I was given this dress as a sample in exchange for my critique of it and so far it gets my 5 star seal of approval. Thanks and have a great day! ~Kiki",1
5,These bracelets are very well made and the colors are vibrant. It looks way more expensive than it is! Looks very similar to a Kate Spade bracelet I once had.,1
5,So these are def what‚Äôs in the picture. There also thick and not thin and easily breakable!,1
5,I bought this as a gift for a friend and he loved it. Everything came exactly as described.,1
5,Adorable fits great. Needs a safety pin to hold the top if you‚Äôre busty.,1
5,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!  I wish there were earrings to go with it made from the same stone.",1
5,"This is surprisingly better quality than another similar ring I had a while back. I am a little scared to adjust it just because I don't want to break it, but it looks great, there is a lot of cute little details on it and it fits my middle finger great.",1
5,Love this dress! It is super comfy and very classy. Stretch material but looks sophisticated. Perfect for long days of being dressed up like weddings or holiday parties!,1
1,"I don't like it, it's too large",0
5,I like hoodies but generally they are too hot for where I live. These are just right nice and light.,1
2,Not like the picture and was way too small.,0
5,Very warm.  Makes morning barn chores tolerable on those very cold days.,1
1,came dead on arrival. analog function did not work . watch looks pretty but of no use.returning on same day,0
2,Theyre so cute but i was disappointed by how light the weight was and how quick the gold<br />Colors turned.,0
5,I bought this for my grandson who claims its the most comfortable one he owns!  Had to convince him to take it off so he would have it for work as he wanted to sleep in it!!,1
1,"This products material was horrible. I was excited to get it do to the fact that it was green and purple, and I happen to like those colors alot. When I tried it on the material was very uncomfortable and the sleeves were too tight and the torso to large. I disliked this product greatly",0
4,"I really like this top. It's very thin so you can layer if you want. But the fit just wasn't right. I'm 5'1&#34; and 130lbs and it fit me, but it Just fit. If I raise my arms my stomach would show and when I sit down it shifts up to expose my back and middle. I like my tops long enough to cover my butt. It's small enough that I'm giving it away to a young family member.",1
4,I am 5'5  and 130lbs.  This costume fit me good.  My husband who is much larger than I am could wear it if he wanted too.  The material is nice and not cheap looking at all.,1
2,It‚Äôs bulky and cheap looking.,0
3,I had to paint clear nail polish on them as they will turn my toes green eventually. It came in a giant set and was very affordable. Would buy again.,0
1,It Broke in two days,0
3,"TOO SMALL IN MID SECTION, BUT VERY CUTE",0
2,Item returned,0
1,Bought them and sent them back to Canada which cost me $25 as they were WAYYYYY toooo smalllll.  I couldn't even get them up past my thighs !!!  Beware.,0
5,Beautiful - substantial and well made.  Love it!,1
5,Great hat.!,1
5,This double cloth cleaning and polishing system works better than any other single cloth cleaning I've every used before.  I am very satisfied at the way this works.,1

1,"Tall (5ft) 11 year old, this is too short",0
2,"The length of these tank tops was extremely shorter than portrayed. Didn't expect best quality, considering the deal I was getting, but the shortness of the shirt was very disappointing.",0
1,I thought they were dumb they don‚Äôt even fit. Lol,0
1,Threading on the top of the slipper came apart by the second day. I sit with my legs crossed while watching TV in the evening. Just the bottom of one slipper rubbing against the other wears through the fabric in just a few swipes.,0
5,"I like these shorts. Comfy, easy to wear.",1
1,"Horrible. If I could, I'd give it zero stars. Instead of the pretty off the shoulder top with the feather pattern, I got this really ugly jacket that felt like it was made of plastic. And I didn't even get a full refund! They only gave me half of my money back. What a complete ripoff. Don't buy this, or who knows what you'll get!",0
5,"I love this necklace. It‚Äôs elegant, matches almost everything. Is priced well and lasts. I have had mine for three years and still wear it. I enjoy this necklace so much, I bought one for me and two to give.  I highly recommend this purchase.",1
5,"This swimsuit is fantastic!  I was really nervous about the white factor...due to it  possibly being see-through but, that's not a problem!  I would definitely recommend ordering one size up it does run a little small.  The front ties add a nautical classy look to it which I really like.  I wore it with a navy blue sarong and I got multiple compliments within half an hourz",1
2,It felt and looked cheaply made and was cut odd,0
5,I enjoyed wearing the sheer Energy pantyhose.,1
2,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 190lbs with a C cup. This shirt was adorable but sadly too slim fitting and not what I was hoping for,0
4,I think it‚Äôs a little thin for what you‚Äôre calling a sweatshirt but I do like it.  I love the colors overall I‚Äôm happy with the purchase!,1
5,I suspected it would be too small for me as I have put some weight on in the last few years and the one size does not usually fit.  I went ahead and ordered it because I knew it would fit my daughter if it did not fit me.  Precious youth:-),1
5,"Lovely. Just as pictured. And, super fast shipping. Arrived a day before it was expected!",1
5,Very cute. My GRANDDAUGHTER<br />Look adorable.,1
4,It's a nice cute apron. Good for daily use.,1
1,VERY SMALL.  Probably children's sizes.  Adult XL doe not fit women's size 9.,0
5,Loved it,1
1,Very small.  Not xxl,0
5,Nice pendant necklace. Like the small size of pendant.,1
4,"Normally wear an XL. Like shirts to be a little lose. Wish I would‚Äôve got a L. With the knot in the front doesn‚Äôt seem to fit correct, but its cute and comfy. May order another color in a L to compare",1
5,Longer than I expected but it was still perfect. It has a soft mesh like feeling.,1
3,Like the dress,0
3,"Super cute! I like the wrap fit, the length, and the pattern. Ended up returning because it is see through, thin, and too low cut.",0
5,Black/Kashmir. Very nice. High quality.,1
4,This bralette is so cute! It was a bit small (C cup) but I mostly needed it for the design to peek out the top of another tank so it worked perfectly for what I needed.  It doesn't provide a whole lot of support so maybe don't expect to be running while wearing this bra.,1
2,"It's cute but it smells like it's been stored away for years in a box.. and lots of loose strings are visible and it's pretty thin. Probably wouldn't have my baby wear just this during winter time. I wouldn't buy from here again rather just pay more for a decent piece of clothing at a brand store. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />UPDATE***<br />I washed it before letting my baby try it on and noticed that along the zipper line, the fabric thinned out already in just one wash and when you lift the fabric with your finger you can see holes and your finger through it. Very disappointed.",0
1,It was cheaply made !,0
1,"Much too big, fell apart. Had to throw away!",0
1,Its not true to size,0
4,I like that this wallet has no screws that will come loose. I place my key card in the money clip and it does not register on scan pad.,1
2,The opening on these don‚Äôt stretch enough to easily accommodate and attach to the ends of most sun glasses.,0
1,"The plaid material on this garment is flimsy, only dyed on one side, and looks very cheap. I returned the piece on the same day it arrived. Very unattractive.",0
5,"I looooovve there shirts! I bought them in every color. They are so perfect for the gym. I stay just as cool as I do in a tank, but I like the coverage! My favorite shirts and I will be buying more!",1
1,"I ordered a 0 to 3 mos & this is more like a 6 mos! My granddaughter is due in June so I ordered it so she could wear it for summer,but at this size it wont fit till winter then it's too cold for it! Guess I wasted money unless they refund me. Very disappointed!!!",0
1,"Tela inc√≥moda, mala calidad",0
3,For my boys.  They came overnight which was a welcome surprise.  Both boys complained of tightness in the toe area.  They cannot be loosened up too much either like you could losen them if they were laced.,0
5,I love it and it arrived Oct. 19 instead of Nov. 13 as promised!,1
1,Stopped working almost a few days after purchase in the middle of a trip where I had no electronics,0
3,LIKE IT JUST A LITTLE SMALL,0
3,"Bought these for gifts and although they are nice, the zippers aren't very sturdy.",0
4,"Got here almost to late for Christmas, ordered it the middle of November. But when I did get it the product was very good.",1
1,"Poor quality. Zippers are extremely flimsy. One bag came with a defective zipper. Another zipper broke and stitching came apart on a third bag, all on the first trip used on.",0
1,These stopped working after ONE use.,0
5,I have braids in so this hat is perfect üëå,1
3,"Boots ARE NOT WIDE CALF, NOT WIDE ANYTHING! Shoe is very narrow at the foot. Only reason I gave 3 stars was because I gave them to my friend(not wide calf) who was able to fit them",0
1,"Broke as I was putting on the first time. Bummed out as it was very pretty, but cheaply made.",0
2,"I bought the case for my daughter who absolutely loves it. However, the casing has become distorted and only becomes worse trying to clean it.",0
5,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, so the length was great for me. A little snug around the chest which I‚Äôm a 34.So cute though I‚Äôll make it work.",1
1,The velcro was shot after 3 months. Garbage:(,0
2,I didn't really like the neon colors. It also pinches in at the waist in a weird way.,0
5,I bought these glasses for the fun of it and they are so cute and trendy! Would definitely recommend! SoJos is such a good and reliable company to buy quality glasses from!,1
1,"Extremely small. Bought the 10/11 year sz for my 50 pound thin grand girl and it does not even wrap around completely in the front, too short in the sleeves and neck area. Very cute as others have stated but really not suited for any useful purpose (warmth etc) fine to play in. I would have replaced but item no longer available.? I will make her a suitable robe.",0
5,This is a lovely robe/jacket! It's so versatile I can ware it all kinds of ways. Dress it up or down or lounge around the house in it. I love pieces like this. The possibilities are endless!,1
5,"We are jewelry designers, and use these in all our galleries to display our work. Plus, I have one for my extensive (well, yeah!) collection. Great size, holds lots of pairs. Good looking. Affordable.",1
2,"I was disappointed when I saw the dress. It's cheaply made, smaller than expected.",0
4,"Everyone loved the costume, including myself of course. You‚Äôll definitely need to buy a new hat, the one that comes with it is just‚Ä¶ pathetic (this is why only 4 stars)<br /><br />The wig and the glasses I purchased from Amazon as well. The hat is also sold on Amazon, I recommend you add a modification to it so you can tie it down, otherwise it will fall constantly.",1
1,Don't waste your money,0
2,"The cross is red (not black), which makes it look more Nazi that I'm ok with. I had to repaint it. The band itself is great, very soft, has a nice weight, and three separate sizes for wrists.",0
5,"Didn't care for the Piloti lettering too much. Everyone thinks they are exercise shoes. Real comfortable.  Confidence in heal/toe movements with clutch, brake, and gas action. Stiffer sole but not enough to interfere with walking, at least as far as I do.",1
1,"Very ill-fitting jumper, unflattering, sheer fabric, straps are not adjustable, VERY oversized for the size printed on the tag.  This jumper is very unappealing, unflattering and overall a poorly made garment.  I would NOT recommend this item to anyone.",0
1,"The description states that this is a leather bracelet. But, surprise! It doesn't FEEL like leather.  It doesn't SMELL like leather.  Most importantly, when you hold it in your hand it does not LOOK like leather.  It feels, smells, and looks like something that is NOT leather.",0
4,Works well,1
5,Yes they kinda seem cheaply made but mine lasted for about 3 months (didn't wear them everyday either) before one of them would just keep turning when I tried to screw it into the spike end. Eventually the back just fell off and I lost it. I never actually noticed them glow in the dark too.,1
1,The sweater is colorful but very thin material.,0
5,"The color, fit, and style is exactly like you‚Äôd imagine. I found it sat well above my hips (intentionally) and I received a lot of compliments",1
3,Runs 2 sizes to small,0
3,Size mismatch,0
5,My kid wears this every day. Doesn‚Äôt want to take it off or wear anything else,1
2,I really like the style and color but the piece between the toe very uncomfortable,0
4,Be sure the button or snap on your shorts is very secure.,1
5,"Haven't tried on yet, but was amazed at the quality of the fabric. Top tier",1
4,To big order one size smaller,1
1,"I did not receive what is pictured, I got a huge pendant in a bag with a chain that doesn‚Äôt look like the one pictured at all. This says dainty but it looks like it‚Äôs for a guy instead of a girl. Very disappointed.",0
5,The graphic design was very nice and the material was super soft/cozy. Love it!,1
5,Simply Beautiful,1
2,Very see through bottoms! Mine has a tear down the front crotch. But the top was perfect!,0
5,"Good fit , very soft",1
3,"The clip ons don't wrap around my  prescription glasses.  Thus create blurry spots.<br />suggest instead a clip on, use prongs to secure.",0
5,"I really like everything about this product, it's amazing, and it's very comfortable. When I got it, I opened it right away and put it on. The ears are adjustable and it's very soft. And it fits mostly everyone.",1
5,So adorable!,1
3,"I like the fit of these and the extra pocket in the back, but don't love the feel of the fabric. It's a bit rough and isn't as stretchy as other athletic shorts, so I tend to avoid wearing them for yoga, rock climbing, or cardio machines. Fine for weights, though.",0
1,Cheap material.,0
5,"EXCELLENT SELLER, GOOD PRODUCT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH :)",1
1,The product received looked nothing like the representation. Very misleading.,0
1,"Very pretty when it first arrived, but the finish peeled off in only 4 days and looks really ugly now and turned my finger green. I thought sterling silver wouldnt do this...",0
2,These socks have a different texture to them and i hated it so i ended up giving them away.,0
5,Very comfortable and cute,1
5,Arrived timely and in working order. Very solid foot measuring device for children. This is being used at home for my grandchildren as some of their shoes are ordered online and being quite young their size changes quickly.,1
3,Some of the charms with words make absolutely no sense at all,0
1,Watch hands fell off within months. Do not buy.,0
1,"Not puffy, very thin and a full burgandy color nothing like the photo",0
1,"Thought the price was great, however when the sizer doesn't lock firmly in place and you have to throw the hat out before you even wear it, then it's to much money spent.<br /><br />POORLY MADE, LOOK ELSE WERE IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY.",0
1,Didn't fit,0
3,I returned this product great quality but came a bit small eife didn't like them,0
5,nice sandals I love my pair they r comfy and just right to wear in the house outside in the summer and that good 4  men and women they r great with my compression stockings 2,1
3,"This is a functional jeweler's loupe, but not a 30X one (I'd guess around 5x, but that's suitable for my needs).<br />The case it came in is just small enough that the hinge from the loupe scratches the case every time you open or close it.  This happened on both of my loupes.<br />The two loupes were placed in a small zip-top back and then placed in a large box without any padding.  The cases did an alright job of cushioning them, but it's still poor shipping practice.",0
5,These shoes are awesome.  They are so comfortable I want to wear them everywhere.,1
2,"Need a size larger, ordered based on sizing chart and bottom is too tight and feels like I'm cutting into my neck tying the straps to hold to suit up on my chest in the right place",0
3,Just took awhile getting here worth wait tho,0
1,After one wear they had to be thrown away as the gold was coming off the knees in big patches.,0
5,Came in quickly and exactly as expected. High quality producy,1
1,"Elastic had very little give, sizing was way too small",0
5,Nice travel belt! Great thing is the extender for people with large waiste! If you are skinny the belt will fit too!,1
3,it's nice,0
2,"I want so badly to love this swim suit!! I‚Äôm a mom of 2 under 2. My body has been through hell and I have not started losing any baby weight yet! I‚Äôve had c sections for both so I have this wonderful scar and belly flap. I don‚Äôt know if I ordered too large or too small. The top fits ok. I am too heavy DD. So it needs to be tightened to keep the ladies from falling out. The bottom. I really don‚Äôt understand. So the back fits like a thong and I don‚Äôt get it. The front when I try to pull it up so it‚Äôs more comfortable there is a gap between my groined and my leg. You can literally see my belly rolling over my c section and like I said the back does not cover my butt. So it‚Äôs not comfortable. So it almost seems like the top is too small possibly and the bottom is maybe too big?? I‚Äôm 5 foot, 175 lbs, DD, no butt, and a mom of 2 babies. This did not work for me unfortunately. Still considering what to do with the bathing suit! To exchange? Return? Or keep my search going!",0
3,The quality of the bralette is mediocre and not pleasant to feel on the skin. Too bad because it s very pretty!,0
1,"I'm 5 ft 2 in, 125 pounds, so I bought a medium which is my typical size. Looked more like an extra small! I couldn't even get the top on (which never happens) much less the bottoms. It looked nice, so I recommend buying it but definitely order up...maybe even two sizes up.",0
2,"Cute hat but definitely of cheap quality. I wouldn't have even minded that much if I didn't recieve it ALREADY scuffed up, on the front... I wouldn't recommend or buy again. I bought this for my boyfriend as an Xmas present and I'm very disappointed, almost embarrassed.",0
1,"this is really coarse material, almost ripped at seams when I tried it on..uncomfortable at the arms.<br />I'm really small built but this was tight in places, and bagged out in others. I ordered 4 different dresses from amazon and they are beautiful, and fit perfectly. This is a return..sorry...",0
4,Beautiful color.  Fits well,1
4,they are a little bit shorter than what i like and im 5 foot 2,1
2,Bought these for an upcoming trip to Acadia National Park. I normally wear a 14-16 so got an XL. I couldn't even get them all the way on. I would say the XL is an 8-10 at the most. Disappointed and they are going back.,0
1,Way to large size i2d in correct!,0
1,I think this had was designed for Shrek because it's huge. Way too big I just threw it out after opening it. Waste of 5 bucks but oh well I guess.,0
5,Sleeve length is perfect.  I usually have to roll up the sleeves of an X-large shirt.  Not this one.  It's been washed once and seems to have kept it's shape and size.  I ordered another one.,1
5,"Excellent quality soft lamb leather and cashmere lining. Sizing is about .5 under standard. So if your normal glove size if 7, buy a 7.5",1
5,Just what i wanted.  Very nice.,1
3,"If you are at all in shape, buy a slim fit. This would work if I got pregnant and barely keeps my chest/shoulder in like a Pamela Anderson baywatch outfit.",0
2,"Really cheap looking. I didn't even take it out of the plastic packaging, and I returned it the day I got it. Buckle looks like plastic.",0
1,Very poor quality,0
1,"I was putting the ashes in the cross and closed it and it broke, can you please send another one or refund my money.",0
1,The dress DOES NOT look like the picture.<br />I specifically wanted a button down dress...<br />And this product looked like a moo moo.,0
4,Loved the fit. Nice sturdy material and well made.,1
3,Had to return them.  Hard to buckle the shoe,0
1,"I loved the look of this chain. Unfortunately it broke before I ever even got to put it on. The chain is very cheap. The dove is attached to the chain, so it cannot be replaced. Sad",0
4,Cute pants. Just thin material and shows panty lines very clearly. Other than that I like them!,1
2,the width of the shoe is giant.,0
3,The dress was very light weight and the length fell right at my knee.  The V neck fit a little weird and the dress seems to want to fall kind of sideways.  I had to keep readjusting it several times throughout the day.,0
1,"Sizes are not corrected , wire is to o hard .",0
2,"This shirt is just ok<br />I am a normal large in shirts, so I ordered a large. I would say it does run about 1 size small.<br />The material is pretty cheap and see thru, so if you order a light color you might have to wear something under the shirt",0
1,"Terrible product, they completely slide down your face (and off your nose and mouth) if you are talking.  Don't waste your money.",0
5,"Usually when I work out with my glasses on, they are fogged up the whole time. This product does an excellent job of keeping that from happening. Sometimes, especially right after I've applied the spray, and water can pool on my glasses, rather than fogging them up. When the glasses do fog up, they tend to de-fog much more quickly than they otherwise would. IF you're struggling right with a mask fogging up your glasses, this product is probably worth investing in.",1
5,These were fantastic hats!  Really cute.  Got lots of compliments!,1
5,"These socks are awesome.  If you have a large calf or are dealing with a lot of swelling, these are the socks for you.",1
2,I have lymphedema with sensitive skin. First off even going by my measurements I should have had plenty of room. They were so hard to get on and the fabric was so rough i skinned my finger pulling them up. Secondly as soon as I walked in the kitchen for a bandaid I had to much material bunch around my ankle. It was to painful I had to take it right back off. I should have had an over inch of extra room according to the measurement guidelines and it was a complete workout getting them on.,0
1,I have bought two of the Coach Corner Zip Small Wristlet for my granddaughter and the zipper on both of them broke almost immediately.  I won't buy another.,0
5,"What I expected. Not the trendiest rain coat, but effective. I doubt it'll last years, but for Florida weather it's perfect.",1
1,Kids size for sure,0
3,"The picture is deceiving. I'm not a tall person (5'4&#34; in shoes with a heel) and the jacket only goes down mid thigh.  Also, you'll need to order 2 sizes larger than normal if you want a fit like the picture shows.",0
1,Its definitely not what they advertised. I asked did they actually meet the size that I was looking for? They said yes! I get the glasses and they're not CLOSE TO MY SIZE!,0
1,Really sloppy looking and too see through. I‚Äôm returning it,0
4,They fit well and work fine. Glad I bought them.,1
1,"Super short.  Oddly tight in the arms.  Horrible fabric and color.  The ""red"" is very orange and is heathered.  So ugly.",0
5,"I ordered this ring before measuring my finger. I am able to wear it on another finger so I won't bother with returning it. I was very happy that despite a holiday week end, my ring arrived earlier than expected.",1
5,These came in and felt and look like real gold.<br />It's for a good price and the quality is amazing. Will definitely be buying these again.,1
5,Love it! Expected it to be grey but the light blue stripes still look good. It's a little tight in the boobs but it makes my boobs look good and the back is shaped to complement your butt.<br /><br />I recommend it for skinny people because the sizes do run small. I have a B cup and it was a little tight.,1
5,"I gave this to my best friend as a gift. It's a beautiful scarf, she loved it and now I plan to order one for myself!",1
3,Very cute until you dry it. It will shrink two sizes down so buy larger. Unfortunately I am tall so I was only able to wear once before it shrunk.,0
5,"I love this necklace sooo much its colourful , light and looks really expensive . Everyone should have one its a must have .great find great price i love it",1
2,Absolutely not true to size as the small I ordered was very large - the top is wider than normal and the trousers are baggy on the leg. The fabric design is nice but it creases easily and the selvage on the front hem of the top is insufficient where there is a strange piece of extra fabric,0
5,My wife loves the dress,1
3,I like the color but you really can't tell they are turtles.  I wish you could,0
2,"very cheap, you get what you pay for.",0
5,"I LOVE these card holders!  I keep my license and credit card in there for easy access, and I feel like they are more secure in there.  Love the sunflowers as well!!!",1
5,Perfect for bangles,1
5,"I bought them for my daughter, she loves them!",1
3,I accidentally ordered two of this dress in the same size. In a way i'm glad I made that mistake because I got two completely different dresses with different tags on them in the same size. One of them is the dress pictured on the page but the other one is different with a mermaid ruffle bottom and that is not what I ordered nor does it match the description on the page or any of the pictures.,0
5,Very pretty,1
5,Was a Christmas gift for my 19 yo son. He loves it and it‚Äôs silky smooth and soft.,1
5,These panties are very comfortable I love them and they are worth the price. :-),1
4,"This is a great shirt, but here's the thing...I took other reviewers' advice and ordered a size up and it's WAY too big! I should have sized DOWN, not UP.<br />I'm 145 lbs, 34C and the XL is swimming on me. It's wide and the sleeves are all loose. It's doesn't even remotely look like it does on the model, on me, in this size.<br /><br />I normally wear Medium or Larges and I likely would have ordered a Large to play it safe had I not listened to the reviews that recommended to size up, and with how large the XL is, I'm sure a Medium would have provided the fit I was looking for.<br />Hopefully it shrinks in the wash! I don't have the time or patience to return it, so if it doesn't shrink I'll just be using it as a sleep/around the house shirt (like I needed another one of THOSE haha).<br /><br />The shirt is nice though. It's your typical t shirt material and it's very soft and comfy.  It's lightweight and sheer enough that you'd still want to match the color of your bra to the color of the shirt, but not so sheer that a nude/taupe bra would be visible.<br /><br />I recommend this shirt, but I'd definitely recommend sticking to your normal size. ;)",1
1,"These were soft and attractive leggings, but the seam in the crotch ripped open while I was out jogging in them. It was only the second time I'd worn them, and I washed them gentle cycle and air dryed them! I even bought the larger size and had extra room in them, so it's not like there was stress on the seams. Very unfortunate, because I liked the colors and softness. I never write 1-star reviews, but I hope no one else wastes their money on these üò£",0
1,"Well, You get what you paid for. No I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone.",0
4,What a hit these were at our daughters birthday party!,1
5,My son loved it when he opened the box,1
5,"they are very durable and colorful.  makes it easy to grab the correct set of keys when heading out the door, and great for walks w/shorts that have no pockets for keys!",1
1,"If you mouth-breathe in a mask (which most of us do) you can't breathe in this product because the plastic, of course, has no air flow. And the plastic steams up. Just useless to me and I got claustrophobia quickly.",0
2,"This is a very interesting dress shape, i really like the print and upper body fit, but the hips were really big, so it gave me this weird pre-columbian pottery shape.",0
5,It was perfect size and nice color for my daughter,1
3,"I really wanted to love this swimsuit but it didn‚Äôt fit me right at all. I‚Äôm taller and it seemed to be too tight length wise. I read other reviews and ordered a bigger size based on that. Was easy to return so that was nice. Bummed it didn‚Äôt fit me.<br />I gave 3 stars because it was great material and design, fast shipping and easy to return.",0
1,THIS IS NOT A MOUSEPAD. NO &#34;RUBBER BACKING&#34; IT IS A PHOTO ON STOCK PAPER.<br />RIP OFF  do not order. they need to be removed as sellers.,0
3,fits as expected,0
3,"This doesn't have the long shape it looks like it has in the photo. Mine was short and wide. You could make this work, but it wasn't very flattering on me. I have a large bust but small waist and this shape didn't emphasize that. The baggy arms under the armpits were not great. If you got a size smaller than usual and don't have a large bust, this might work for you.",0
5,"This product is just beautiful. The color is a very vivid blue! It contained the vest, the necktie, the bowtie, and the pocket square. Each individual piece was wrapped separately. The stitching appears to be strong and durable. I can't state how beautiful the deep blue color is on all of these items.",1
5,"So cute!, perfect fit and good looking.",1
2,"While assembly was fairly easy, there were multiple issues. The two top nobs had been broken off and still obviously placed inside the box together. It wad obvious that they were broken as they both had jagged plastic on the bottom and you could see the other half of the plastic in the corresponding holes. Next, 2 holes had to be drilled myself as the holes it came with were off so far i couldn't make them work. Next, the slotted pink shelves on the upper unit, the whole thing was drilled so off square it really strands out how crooked out looks. Lastly, the pink little box that goes on the back wall wad totally split at the seems and i had to use superglue and a clamp to make it work.<br /><br />This assembly was much more difficult than it should have been and the QC process obviously failed on my box. If it wasn't Christmas weekend when i put this together for my kid, the day before Christmas eve in fact, I'd return this for another. I had to MacGyver this thing together at enough places that i can't recommend it for most folks, not everyone could do it.",0
5,Needed to order a size bigger than normal but it was exactly as described and she loved it.,1
1,This product is to small.  It‚Äôs a cover up but doesn‚Äôt even go to your waist,0
1,Cheap and way too small. The price matches the suit  CHEAP!!!,0
1,I like the Snap-on jewelry because of the versatility. I received it today and put it on immediately and was happy to do that within 3 hours the faux leather started entwining and pretty much just destroyed the whole effect of the bracelet. The seller had quick delivery which I appreciate but oh I wouldn't purchase this particular item because of the pleather around the bracelet,0
4,"Not as shiny in real life, but still pretty.",1
2,sharp edges,0
5,no problems,1
3,"Really like the necklace which is great quality, but the wheel should have been larger so you can see it better when worn.",0
5,Great price for lots of fun dress up jewelry for kids.,1
2,Cute but too big,0
3,"The shirt is nice but it runs large, size down. Also its very thin.",0
2,I would not buy. Arrived smashed does really fit properly.,0
5,"It's fun and pretty, very reasonably priced. I have a small wrist, so it's a little loose, but that is a common problem for me.",1
1,"I don't know who the models are in the pics, but they must be awful tiny in size. When I saw their pics, I said this is the size I've been looking for. These earrings are tooooo small for even newborn babies ears. So disappointed and upset.",0
1,Awful on size.. this is not even close to a 14-16!!! Smh,0
3,I thought she looked nice in this suit but she thought it was just too cheesy for her to wear at the pool.,0
5,Waist and length are perfect,1
5,"Great quality. Exactly as the picture. Love these, they go with everything, light weight and easy!",1
1,"The stones are huge, bigger than my nipple.",0
5,Absolutely love them and don't understand how they made it so cheap,1
1,"The hat arrived with the face shield separate from the hat. Impossible to get the zipper on, it looked pretty cheap and a bit frayed around the stitching. No way to get the zipper on....just would not slide into the cheap components.",0
3,"If it had fit I totally would be keeping it.  It is cute 50s style dress but it is also a 50s sizing chart because there is no way that this in an xl in today standards.  You can't go off the amazon chart on this.  I am having to return it as there is no larger size available.  I would say maybe the xl would fit a ladies size 10, maybe.  I received this as a promotional test product at a discounted price to test out and review.  This is my limited and unbiased opinion.",0
1,Horrible  quality is bad,0
3,"This company needs to review their quality control. I threw all my paperwork away because the bow ties in their plastic package looked good. Well!  When I took them out instead of 12 there were only 11. While one less is no big deal, I paid for 12. Do, if u order these, count them.",0
3,Ing is disappearing after only wearing it a few times.,0
4,It breaks after few uses,1
4,"Pretty nice. Not as good as original laces that came with Keen boots, but not bad.",1
5,as described,1
1,Came broken. Otherwise would have been good.,0
3, ,0
2,"Wire for the speaker embedded inside is not that long so the beanie stays fairly tight on your head.  Also, this is more for winter use.  I bought it because I thought it would be a thin material and I could wear it to the gym... BIG mistake...",0
5,This picture is a sweet-faced as my own Cavvy. I take here everywhere with me.,1
5,Beautiful key chain. Great quality and packaging! Gave out as favors and everyone loved them!,1
5,"Love this headband!! Well made and adorable, highly recommended!",1
5,Really good quality. Very cute.,1
4,üëå,1
5,This mask has a great picture. Fits perfect,1
1,"These pants looks nothing like the picture advertised. I am unsure as to the other reviews that I see, however it is nothing like the picture advertised. I would not buy again.",0
5,"Perfect size, easy to put in, doesn't tarnish!!",1
1,"Awful quality, made of thin cheap plastic, extremely disappointed. Does not look nothing like the picture",0
3,run big,0
5,"The outfits I purchase always seem to fit because I always order one size larger than my true size fit. But, that's also because I like clothes on my body a bit loose. I will say I have nothing but good things to say about Allegra K brand and Uxcell shipping brand. These companies are amazing! They provide a unique product at a reasonable price (usually with free shipping because of the quantities I order). So comfortable and of good quality. A button may of fell off here or there but always came with them all and very easy to sew back on. I do not dry any of their clothing; and because of this- the clothes never lose their shape or color. I am in love and haven't been regular store clothing shopping since I've been purchasing these brands online on Amazon. I don't usually do reviews (obviously because I end up writing a novel) but this brand deserved a review!!!",1
2,"There is no beige. It's replaced with pink, but the images are all misleading. Beige is not a color option. If you needed beige as I did, then purchase elsewhere.",0
2,I don‚Äôt even know how to describe the fit of this. The bottom was cute and a great length but there was literally no way to tie the top to make it work. I‚Äôm small chested and can normally get away with low cut or plunging necklines easily. I couldn‚Äôt figure out a way to tie this dress to make it even remotely wearable. Disappointing because the quality was good and the colors were so pretty,0
1,The mechanism for attachment was different than original. The original could be removed and reattached in seconds. This one will require me to find a jeweler to attach . I missed the return window,0
5,"These were exactly what I was looking for to wear with tunics, leggings, and cowboy boots. I've had no issue with them not staying exactly where I put them. No riding down, no excessive stretching at all.",1
1,"It‚Äôs small and compact. Appealing to us firefighter that it‚Äôs made from decomissioned fire hose but it‚Äôs not worth $29.99. I can only fit 4 cards in mine and that‚Äôs with forcing them in and out and I mean forcing. I got this to keep my cards from damaging in my back pocket wallet but as had as it is to force them in and out of this thing, I think it‚Äôs more of a risk of damage using this wallet.",0
2,This was my second one and I was actually happy with st first but a month down the line the looping mechanism starting not catching and the return window ran out so I'm stuck with a loose belt .,0
5,"I injured my knee falling a couple of years ago, and it has bothered me on and off ever since.<br /><br />This knee compression sleeve comes with a strap. It comes with only very terse instructions on the bag that they come in. I was confused about how to use the strap, but then I saw that there are some in the product description on Amazon. When I used the strap it made my knee feel relieved, so I have been just wearing the sleeve and the strap in the mornings and it feels great. You could definitely wear this around the house or during any other activity.<br /><br />It has had no issues with slipping while I've been wearing it. The sleeve that I got fit me well and I find it very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />It fits very well under my jeans and it can't be seen through them as it is very thin. It is only breathable in the back so it keeps my knee quite warm, but not uncomfortably so, It makes me feel very secure when I'm wearing it and my knee has felt better when I am wearing it. I definitely will continue to use it.<br /><br />I have washed this on a high heat cycle and so far it has held up through 2 washes very well. There has been no shrinking or loss of elasticity.<br /><br />I would never steer a friend wrong and I would never give kudos where it is not deserved. I am not desperate for discounts or freebies, so there is no motivation for me to write anything other than the truth. This being said, I found this product to be a great product and worth the money. I recommend them to anyone who needs it. Thanks I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review.",1
2,It was okay.,0
3,Very basic - material is thin - not a good glove for outdoor activity.,0
1,"The buttons started coming off as soon as I took these out of the package. They don't stay up on my daughters legs; They slide right down. At least they were cheap so I don't feel ripped off (you get what you pay for) but I literally have no use for these other than to hope she grows into them enough in a few years that they stay up, and sew the buttons back on",0
1,"I like NOTHING about this product.  It is NOTHING like the description.  I paid $19.99 per pair, and it is worth about $.01.  The jeans are paper-thin.  They are entirely too tight - they are NOT relaxed fit in the size I ordered.  This is a case of false advertising.  The quality of the material is extremely poor.  This is only one of two Amazon products in ten years as a loyal customer that have angered me.  D NOT purchase anything from this vendor...;buyer beware.",0
3,Way to sm could not even get them on.,0
3,"My daughters love playing with this mask but right out of the package it has a very strong odor, can only describe as a chemical ""plastic"" smell and it hasn't gone away after weeks of playing with it, I don't know how my kids can breathe in it and I make them hang it up so it can air out. The mane and horn came detached and I had to glue them back on after a few wears. Hope it lasts until Halloween!",0
5,"I absolutely love this hat. So beautiful just like was shown. I was nervous because I have a big head somewhere in between 23/ 24. So it is hard for me to find hats that fit, one reason I do not  generally buy online, But this was PERFECT! Love the fur, love everything about it!",1
4,Grandes,1
5,"So well made. Light and beautiful to the touch and to look at, a wonderful buy.",1
3,"These sunglasses are okay. I could probably get a better quality product for the same money at Target, but I was already placing an order and needed a new pair. One of the side details either was missing when it came, or fell off the first day. They fit alright, but will not stay on top of my head if I push them up.",0
5,"Fit nicely to the skin, comfortable, no sweat stains at all!! I absolutely love these shirts, since they make my physique pop in a good way. Plus, they're good for exercise or a long day at work where you're moving around a lot.",1
1,"Finally received it in the mail, opened the box to find there were no earrings in there at all.",0
3,Not a good quality,0
5,"this bag holds everything, including 2 water bottles, for every day use during traveling",1
5,Cuteeee,1
2,Very small and hard to wear.,0
5,It goes well with almost any color.,1
1,"Top Band is higher in the front than the back, but somehow the leg openings are shorter in the back.  Leg openings have virtually no elastic.  Material feels ok but I'll probably throw these away rather than be uncomfortable in them all day.",0
5,Love love love this dress I bought it twice!,1
5,Got this for a friend she loves it,1
5,"Lana Merino es c√°lida para invierno como fresca para el verano, absorbe muy bien el sudor y lo evapora f√°cilmente. La prenda muy elegantemente presentada.",1
5,Nice bra,1
5,This hat was everything...fits great stayed on all day. Wore it to the Detroit Derby.,1
5,Light weight material that breathes. It‚Äôs soft and it didn‚Äôt shrink or fade after washing. Lots of compliments from other schitts creek fans!,1
5,Great fitting and lots of compliments on how it looked,1
5,"Bought this Item because it was reviewed and found to do a Great Job Protecting Bottles.<br /><br />Well, I have yet to Break anything since I Purchase theVinniBag Inflatable Travel Bag.<br /><br />Compared to Expensive Libations These Protective VinniBags are an Inexspensive Purchase.  Buy Several, Be Happy, Don't Worry !!!",1
3,"Way TOO BIG!.<br />I tried to go off the chart, but after reading the other reviews I thought I would be fine with my normal size. ehhh Wrong on that one.<br />I am 5'8 - average build (usually wear a M/L) and this made me look like I was wearing a potato sack that was 2 sizes too big. If I decide to repurchase I will go with the smallest size.",0
5,I love it a large was perfect but not big enough for a dress look just a t shirt look. Get bigger size if you want to wear it like a dress.,1
1,This product didn't fit well at all on my back up valve...,0
5,Just as advertised.  Hung nicely form our elastic web on our door.  We used to have a huge fur spider that my mother made (and years ago got eaten by something in the attic) when I was a kid.  This was a much smaller version of what she had made for us and it was fun to have for my own kids.,1
1,"the side volume buttons didn't work, they actually fell off, do not recommend",0
5,Everything about the blouse,1
5,I love it! My purses are in a safe place!,1
5,"These slipper socks are THE best by far! They are super soft inside with non skid on the bottom. The quality is amazing, soooo comfy! I will definitely be ordering more for gift and for myself!",1
3,My 2.5 year old daughter loved them. The run quite small wish we would have ordered a bigger size but good quality. She insisted on squeezing her foot into them right away or I‚Äôd send them back for a bigger size.,0
5,I love the dress and the fit,1
1,I Did not order these because of the reviews and sounds of quality...,0
5,The kids loved these and therefore wore them!!,1
3,"Soft stretchy material, slightly different color. This shirt can really only be used as a nightgown.  Looks like pajamas.",0
1,I did not like how it looked on me.,0
2,"It fit well everywhere except right in front, across the chest. It had an odd ""flappiness"" near the armpit area. I sent it back.",0
1,Dress took well over a month to arrive and wasn't anywhere near the size I ordered and I ordered a size larger.,0
3,"I love the look of these shoes, and they are comfortable if you are just sitting in one spot but the design of the heel makes them quite wobbly.  The heel narrows almost like a high heel shoe and thus I have a tendency to fall over sideways when wearing them.  So far it's just been embarrassing but I could definitely see an ankle sprain in the future.  I bought two pair like this from Rocket Dog and the other platform flip flop is much more stable.",0
1,"great price, great looking, only problem is that it doesn't work.",0
4,Fits nice and shipped fast...,1
5,It was cute but couldn't get it to work for me. I was sad.,1
5,I love it very small but so pretty Thank you!!!,1
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy this bag. It looks really nice and seems to have everything you need in a duffle bag, but one tug on the zipper and boom you see how cheap this piece of crap really is. Zippers lasted one full pull before falling off. It's made cheap and awful. Beyond disappointed with this thing will never order from this seller or store again.",0
5,"This was perfect love this jumpsuit,please order up on size",1
5,"These are aawesome!<br />I recently went in a trip and used my cubes.  It made packing a breeze,  and in packing even easier.  I left my clothes in the cubes and they fit nicely in the dresser,  when it was time to pack up I just zipped them back up and placed in my luggage.<br />The sizes were perfect for all of my items.<br />I did receive a discount for testing this product.  I could not find a thing to improve the product.<br />You will be very happy with your purchase.",1
5,Beautiful dress. I received a lot of compliments.,1
3,Too small.,0
3,The top is pretty cute but the fabric was not breathable and the arms are cut very wide in comparison to the overall size. I returned it.,0
5,"I was impressed with the fit of the dress and material. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 150 lbs 32 DD and ordered a Medium. It came almost to my knees, so bending over a bit didn‚Äôt expose the tush. You would have to iron out the bottom part when it comes in, but that was no issue for me. I would definitely buy more in different colors.",1
4,I bought it for my friend who recently got a baby girl. I pictured the pink background and cactus pattern fits her very well.  I like it in general.,1
5,Love!,1
1,"Was expecting a long skirt like shown on pictures. I received one that's short, about knee long. Disappointed",0
5,Good,1
5,Fits very nice!!!!,1
3,This watch is still work for me,0
5,It's a good mask for social distancing or just just biking and fishing. Very lightweight..snug fit for normal male heads but is adjustable for smaller head sizes like woman..,1
3,I love it. Mine shrunk the more I washed it sadly,0
2,Order a medium which is my normal size and it was snug in the hip/butt area-not flattering at all. Sadly I missed the window so I cannot return it!,0
3,"I love the thickness and the feel of this choker, but the downside is that it's too big!! I put it on at the tightest and it still slides down my neck.",0
3,"My son loves them, they're comfortable but the strap is huge and when you tighten them it sticks out very far and looks bad. He doesn't want to get rid of them for that reason though.",0
4,These have been a life saver during my pregnancy.,1
1,They tarnished black very fast,0
3,"Okay for price, but not of quality.",0
5,Recipient loved it!,1
4,"It's very cute, but small, so made more for a child than an adult.  My sister wore it and it fit fine, but the tail is short and ears small for an adult.",1
5,It fits perfect came in time as expected great material!!,1
5,For the price of the watch it is great all three Dios actually work which is rare for the price of this watch and it holds seconds minutes it‚Äôs awesome definitely worth it,1
3,"it's beautiful, but a large is quite small.",0
5,"The color combo is great; I picked the green. It fits perfectly. The material is soft and comfortable. I tried it on, but have not worn it. It is still to warm to wear it. It will be good for fall and not too cold winter days.",1
2,Definitely not worth the money.  This was a cheaply printed hoodie.  Took way too long to ship.  Pass on this one.,0
4,I really like them. Good looking and comfortable shoes.,1
1,no quality,0
3,Sturdy and bright and  comfortable. The zipper is a great idea for travel.. but the panties are a little tight.  These are definitely &#34;Granny Panties&#34; but that's okay as I'm a granny :-) .,0
3,The material is not as stretchy as cotton.  This shows my curves.  Very cute shirt though.,0
5,All of my cards fit and I just love my new wallet. Paid good for it too,1
1,"fits weird , very small in the arms but too lose for the actual shirt . Nothing like how it looks on the modelüò≠",0
1,"Not even worth the 1 star, a piece of crap that even $0.99 would have been overpriced and $20 is definitely not worth, didn't last more that a day.",0
3,"Ok, but for sure small",0
5,Love this! Has become a staple in my wardrobe.  Good quality.  I ordered both a small and medium and kept the small.  For reference I am 5'4 and 125lbs.,1
3,Fit well but cheaply made.,0
3,they worked great but the ball and threads broke off after a while,0
5,Made of sturdy materials and looks great for guys or girls. Been wearing it off and on for the past week and love how it doesn't latch to close but actually just slides closed on your wrist. Makes it very comfortable.,1
5,This suit fits very well - I often find swimsuits to fit me disproportionately but this one was perfect.  Straps are particularly comfortable.,1
1,One week after purchasing this key ring the whole mechanism completely fell apart...embarrassing as it was a gift for a friend who had just moved into her new home...,0
5,"The dark green is a lovely color. The dress is adorable, fits me well, it is comfortable and does not look cheap. My measurements were on the border of the size up, but since the fabric stretches, the smaller size fit me perfect. I wanted to look sexy but elegant, and this style was perfect. I ordered the design that has the plain flared skirt because the lace sleeves were long enough to disguise my chubby arms. I have a 40-inch bust size, but the medium fits nicely since the lace is a stretchy fabric.",1
3,"The quality appears good but the fit is totally wrong for my smaller face.  I had to bend them so they'd stay on.  So, for me, they are only OK.",0
3,Sent it back because it had writing on it. The pic showed black sweater. Other than that it look fine.,0
2,Quality,0
5,Very good,1
2,They don‚Äôt stick very well but looked cute enough to try.,0
4,"At this price this watch is awesome! Looks great, keeps time,  good deal.",1
4,Another nice piece of fish and you‚Äôre right the colors are bright and it‚Äôs well-made for the price,1
5,Very nice and light weight. Loved the design. Color was a bit different than expected but very pretty still!,1
1,"This collar is a piece of junk.  It is basically for show only. The links are huge and bulky and remind me of a gangsta wanna be.  The links are not solid so if you have a large dog who give 1 good yank, there is a decent chance that the links will open up.  Finally, the collar is much smaller than expected.  My dog has a 15.5 neck and cant wear this.<br /><br />If you're looking for costume jewelry for your dog, get this and size up.  Otherwise, save your $",0
3,Too big for me,0
3,Like the mask but not for smaller kids 3 and 4 year old mask too big.,0
5,"Product as described, perfect fit, love the pj's",1
5,The silicon band is great the face stays where ever you put it.  Better than my faithful twist-o-flex band that has always been on my watches.  May purchase the other colors.  Thanks!,1
3,Material seems good. The pin on one side comes out of the roller of the buckle. I guess I have to use super glue to keep it together.,0
5,Bought this for my daughter who loves purple.  They are absolutely beautiful.,1
1,Poor quality  My daughter only wore this twice and the button ripped out of the bib - ripping the fabric too,0
2,Boot fits just a little too loose. I know boots are supposed to have a slight slip but these slip a little more than should be. I‚Äôd say order half size down,0
3,It would have been great but it was way too small.  Had to return it.,0
1,"No. No. No! I want my nice cottony Fytto support socks back! These are slick, like opaque tights. Not thick. Not warm. When will the Fytto 4080 be available again, please???",0
4,No complaints. Fits well. Husband is happy.,1
1,"Terrible quality, cheap fabric and its printed, not woven design.",0
5,I‚Äôm more than please with these shirts so much please that I order to packs of the white shirts and two packs of the black ones. Excellent quality thank you.,1
3,"Band fits fine but upon wearing it the band keeps popping out of place on the device. I noticed that it is missing a screw on one side, also the band is turning blue. It does not rub off on your skin though. If it had both I'd give it a few more stars.",0
4,Love the idea of the float cropped pant. I didn‚Äôt like the material. It felt weird and the texture wasn‚Äôt my style.,1
5,Very easy to switch out and I like the colors.,1
5,It fit perfectly on my 2-year old grandson.,1
3,The only thing that I dont like is the pocket placement. Its on the back side... random.,0
1,Started getting white spots. Probably dried sweat. Tried washing it off and it doesn't work. Wish this didn't happen.,0
3,"its soft, but its not like a normal scarf literally like a mini blanket. its head a bit when I washed it, as expected, its a decent scarf for the price",0
4,Product was as described but I am frustrated that the stretchers and tunnels were not marked. 14G and 12g look exactly the same in the tunnels I received.,1
3,The bottoms fit for a plus size but the top does not match up. The top is tiny.,0
5,For it's price range it works fantastic. Purchased another pair for dad.,1
1,The bikini protector got stuck on it. So now it has glue and part of the protector in the underwear. I hated it!,0
5,Our twin boys wore these during Easter and continue wearing for the spring.  The hat is perfect on them (they are 3.5months old) and we've gotten so many complements.,1
3,They are a thick sock but somewhat small.,0
2,Good enough to wear once or twice.  Cheap but its expected for the price,0
1,Very bad quality. Color was awful. The fabric looked and felt extremely cheap. Had to return it immediately.,0
4,This is a gift for my niece and she will love it.,1
5,Really good üëçperfectly feet üëå,1
5,"The material is soft and light. It fits perfect, and the length. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and it falls past my ankles",1
5,"I bought this for my granddaughter, she loved it and it fit perfectly",1
1,I bought this about 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôve worn it 3 times and the bottom ball is completely unraveling. Cheap cheap cheap. Poor quality. Don‚Äôt waste your money,0
5,Great quality socks so far for great price,1
1,I am returning this because it's really tiny and it's not beige - more of a peach orange. I can't use it.,0
5,Excellent product!,1
5,They fog from time to time but hold up pretty well. They are also easy to clean,1
1,Too small to hold much of anything.,0
1,This item is not true to size. It looked well made and exactly what I wanted but was super disappointed it didn‚Äôt fit. Gave it away as it was to much of a hassle to return cuz no address available or packing slip for return. Money wasted. The sizes are small and  Asian influenced,0
3,A decent back up pair of glasses. They work.,0
1,It runs extremely small,0
4,"I used these for tough mudder. They were great to have on some obstacles, but on some of the others they were more than a hindrance than the obstacle. They don't advertise for being used in Mudder, so I can't fault them that! Great gloves all around.",1
2,The zipper broke after less than 6 months of use.  I would not recommend,0
5,I like the fabric and the perfect fit. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúgo to‚Äù dress for me. It‚Äôs perfect,1
1,Did not come with rubber O rings like the description said it would. Therefore they are useless.,0
3,Looks cheap & dull with a little bit to sparkle. Looks like they that 8 small diamonds to use on this neckle.,0
4,"I think the dress is beautiful! I love the material and style of the dress, unfortunately, I had To send it back because of the sizing issue. The top area was too large, while the rest of the dress fit fine.",1
5,"Very nice quality, packaging, style! Comes with a dust bag. Love the bright green color - will be easy to find it my purse, a Bostanten that I also purchased from Amazon. This is a wallet with capacity for everything, yet a slim design. I like!",1
2,"I bought these sports bras for running and hoped they would provide significant support for my DD chest.  These sports bras run a bit large; I bought a XL and about 3 miles in, the elasticity begins to go.  There is less support if the padded inserts are taken out.  Unfortunately, after two washings, the padded inserts disintegrated and the covering peeled off.  That is very disappointing.  I would not purchase these again and do not recommend, especially if running long distances..",0
3,Good construction but didn't fit well.,0
4,The back of the legs is to short but the rest fits good,1
1,The pendant is beautiful I loved it. The chain is flimsy. The first time I put it on I fell asleep in it by accident. I woke up to a ripped chain and my necklace in the covers. I‚Äôm still considering replacing the chain bc I love the pendant. However I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that.,0
5,My son really liked this costume for Halloween as the Invisible Man. It seemed to be a quality costume. We didn't experience any problems with the seams or the zipper even though and an eleven-year-old was boisterous in it for two nights.<br /><br />I did hear that it ran just a little bit small so I ordered a size up and it was perfect for him.,1
5,"Loved this shirt!! The material was light weight and good quality. Thank you for making this, it was perfect!",1
2,"ordered numbers  1-50, used them for LOTO locks received (2) of 41 to 50 and no 31-40",0
5,awesome,1
5,Beautiful. If in between sizes. I recommend sizing down. I love the dress.,1
5,"This necklace is beautiful!  The packaging was so nice, elegant. Two chain concept is brilliant. Absolutely would reorder this product for myself and gifts!",1
4,Just a little see-thru,1
5,"Bought them for my 4 y/o granddaughter.  She likes to look at my iPad for toys and wanted a pair of glasses like my reading glasses.  She loves them, won‚Äôt take them off.",1
5,My Wife loves it!!! I good for going to the Cowboys game.,1
1,Very small and awkward to use,0
1,shirt i received is NOTHING like shown. This material is really strange and it feels like a really thick Childs bathing suit. It is really wide and really short like you should be 3 feet tall. Horrible purchase,0
5,Love these glasses,1
5,These are awesome hoops!  They are the exact large size i wanted after purchasing so many in the past that fell short of the hoop size!  great price for both!,1
4,Very cute retro one piece.  I ordered the green and it's a little between teal and green.  I really like the color.  It's a tad snug but that's because I am pregnant.  Will fit great after baby and provide good coverage.  I usually don't like ties behind by neck because I have a large bust but this didn't seem to pull so hard on my neck. I also figure I could see the ties to the back to make it more of an over the shoulder style.,1
2,The color and size are true to advertising however the scarf itself is lesser quality fabric than it appears in pictures. I would not buy again.,0
3,"Nice stretchy material, looked just like the picture. It was a bit big in the armpit area so my daughter has to wear and under shirt but she is also stick thin. Otherwise no issues she loves it and that‚Äôs what matters",0
5,THE SHOES ARE TRUE TO SIZE. THEY ARE SUPER CUTE,1
3,The shirt is a good quality soft not rough. But the cow is very blurry.,0
4,"These are very nice except the pants are a little on she short side. If it wasn't for that, I would have given them 5 stars.",1
4,"Very nice ring, true to size.",1
1,"The top was very small, the bottoms too big. Doesn‚Äôt look any thing like the pictures",0
5,Awesome,1
1,Returned item,0
1,Broke in one day cheaply made,0
1,I was hoping for a casual dress to wear around the house and for running errands but the material is very thin and flimsy.  It would be good for a beach cover up but that's not why I ordered it. Its also very low cut so a camisole and a slip would be needed and that is not what I want to wear in the Texas heat.,0
3,Design is beautiful but material is very fragile. Make sure you ring is packaged/delivered in a sturdy box/packaging or your ring may be compromised.,0
5,I use it for medium back support in the gym. You can really cinch it down.,1
5,Very nice ring!!!,1
1,Cheap awful,0
5,Perfect for the winter weather. Love the design and the fuzzy lining.,1
2,"I thought these would be okay, I've purchased CZ's before and never had them look so cloudy and dull.  I wish I would have taken the time to return these as they are now just sitting in my jewelry box.",0
2,"For the first month I had no issues. After that, it started to turn my skin green and itch. The metal then started to change color and look dirty no matter how many times I cleaned it. I only recommend if you plan on changing your dermal all the time like any other piece of jewelry that matches your outfit. Because it reminds me of costume jewelry.",0
2,I love love bebe sunglasses. Im a loyal customer. I own 6 pairs. Not just bought from Amazon. I buy them from different places. However this is the first pair im disappointed in. When I got them I put them on and they are loose fitting. Its like someone with a big big head put them on and stretched them out. They fall off my face. Im thinking I might give them to my friend.,0
2,Not warm or thick,0
1,"Seriously? A satin ‚Äúformal‚Äù dress arrives in an envelope??? It looks like it was rolled up in someone‚Äôs dirty laundry basket. I questioned whether I accidentally bought a ‚Äúused‚Äù dress. The stitching is crooked, edges of material looked dirty. No hooks to keep back bow straight across the back, flops to one side. Embarrassed for this vendor- does not reflect well at all on them.",0
3,"I'm 5'4, 135 lbs, 32a/34b cup, about 40&#34; around my butt.  The bottom was too small, the top was too large, but I only really needed it for the bottom to match a top I have. I can pull it off for the price, but doesn't look great.  Made for women with large B or small C cup, and about a 35&#34; butt.",0
5,"I buy these for my 4 and 2 year old. They love them and are great for dress shoes and slip on flats. Yes, they tear...just like mine, if I walk outside without shoes. They hold up pretty well usually have to toss them because they get old, not because of them ripping. Highly recommend.",1
5,Love it..soft and comfortable,1
5,"It goes without saying that you get what you pay for here. But, frankly the watch looks much nicer than $25. It's no Cartier Santos. But for 1/30 of the price, it'll do just fine.",1
3,Cute set.  Shirt and shorts are a little on the short side.,0
3,So the reviews were right it is not as long as the photo implies but I still think it's super cute. I like to wear somewhat quirky clothing from time to time and this fit the bill. 3 stars because it's not as long as advertised,0
5,This top fits well and looks good. Washes and tumble dries quickly with no creasing. I‚Äôm pleased with it.,1
4,HAVE NOT WORN THEM YET. TIME NOT RIGHT AS I AM GOING TO WEAR THEM FOR GOLF.  THEY FIT  FINE.,1
5,I love this tiara! Other tiaras are too small. This one fits perfectly. I would like to buy another one of a different color.,1
3,"This sweater vest was enormous. I'm 5'7 with an hourglass/slight pear shape and wear a 24W top and 26W bottom. The 2X was like a tent dress on me. I have wide shoulders and it was sliding off the sides.  It's also not very flattering on curvy bodies because it ends mid-thigh, past the optimal point for flattery (widest point of the hips). It might be better on thinner physiques and wear it like a dress, not a vest.<br />It is soft though, and feels pretty well made. Just not for me.",0
1,Very poor quality. I will not buy these again. The findings break off way too easily.,0
5,Fits perfectly and looks adorable!,1
5,It definitely makes a statement when I wear it! John R.Duncan,1
3,El producto lleg√≥ bien se ve bien es de buena calidad mi √∫nico inconveniente es que compre unas botas para clima c√°lido de senderismo y me enviaron unas votas de invierno tiene peluche en la parte interna y en Venezuela eso es muy caliente.,0
1,Does not fit a Gear Sport watch!,0
4,Do not order a size up.  It makes the sleeves too long.,1
1,Really worthless,0
2,"I would be giving one star if it wasn't for the fact that the dealer shipped very quickly and with good protection. However. The glasses are too dark to bear the name Burn Notice. Mark my words if you are getting these to look like Michael, you will be a sad kitty.",0
3,"It was too loose too short on me, but I'm 5'5"" and 108 pounds.  The dress was a beautiful mustard yellow, but I was a bit weirded out by the cut in real life.",0
5,These are by far my fav par of leggings. I have a larger butt and they still fit perfectly.,1
4,I thought this was a shirt but I love it because I'm 5'2&#34; and it fits perfectly as a dress. I really like it and the color is a true navy.,1
3,Not quite as long as I was anticipating. It‚Äôs cute but needed to be a tad longer,0
1,Horrible sizing.  Not attractive at all.,0
4,"Warm gloves on those cold mornings gripping the steering wheel on the way to work and they are washable, I‚Äôve washed and dryer mine twice.  They are not leather but they are still nice.",1
5,Very soft material. Not see through. Plan on purchasing other colors. Sizing is as expected.,1
5,Beautiful. Great service.,1
5,Legit,1
5,"Size large fits the 150lb. 5'2&#34; frame well. It could be a bit looser in the midriff and longer in length. I would recommend a better quality of buttons as well. Overall, the arm holes fit, the blouse is true to size-love the soft texture of rayon, the burgundy looks wonderful. It is a versatile look that could be dressed up or down. I like the comfort, cozy feel of it;) Great! Recommend for summer wear.",1
4,Comfy and casual,1
1,Terrible quality of fabric.  Sent it back.,0
3,"Poor stitching, bottom under the criss cross was stickingout funny. Unfortunate because it was a sexy dress.",0
3,"The leather on this band is clearly bonded leather. Over time, I do not think that it will last. You get what you pay for though. Looks good, feels robust. Decent value for the price. Buckle looks sorta bulky. Nothing a file and sandpaper won't fix.",0
3,Super cute but no compression,0
5,"These things are cool. When my wife and I ride at night downtown Monterey we get cheers and looks. There durable,too.",1
1,Turned finger black within a few days.,0
5,love this,1
5,The robe is very soft and comfortable.,1
1,"I don't feel like this watch is even a, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; product. This watch fell apart and stopped working during the first couple weeks with very minimal usage.  If you are looking for a cheap watch I would look elsewhere, it couldn't get much worse...well, I guess it could have been delivered broken or covered with black widow's...It could alway be worse, but this watch is pretty down there. Send me $15 dollars and I will send you a picture of my watch, it will be just as useful...in all seriousness, this watch is a big don't buy.",0
5,"It was absolutely worth 10 bucks, a valuable gift",1
5,This band compliments my Ticwatch E Ice perfectly.  The Ice is white so the white holes work really well.  It is very easy to put on and is very comfortable.  I especially like that the end of the band is tucked away. The little piece that connects the two ends of the band fits great and has an edge to make sure it stays in place.  I got a small but there are plenty of holes to accommodate a larger wrist.  The quick release pins are sturdy and easy to use. I plan on purchasing more colorful bands for summer wear.,1
1,This is crap! Don‚Äôt buy it.,0
3,"When my husband wears the sun glasses in the sun, it gives him a headache. The glasses look good and feels great when wearing them.",0
1,The balls don‚Äôt screw on tight enough to stay together on the ear. I lost a few earrings already. Also some of the pieces aren‚Äôt even earrings just metal rings that are very flimsy,0
1,"The fabric felt awful, not comfortable at all. Also, the cut was odd and didn‚Äôt hang right.",0
3,"The lenses are great, but they pop out of the cheap frames. Not hard to put back in, but a pain while driving.",0
3,it's good to hold your key but the hook did not last long.,0
5,"Note: I have owed several Daily skorts and in my opinion they run a bit small thru the waist. But I was aware of this and ordered accordingly. The fabric is beautiful and love that is not a pull on skort which never fit me very well. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 115lbs. While I usually wear a 4 in most brands I always order 6 in Daily. The shorter length is perfect for a more petite person.",1
1,the second i the out it was a wreck! both of them are cross therded so the bunny wont stay cant use them at all!!!!!!,0
2,Not true to size,0
1,"I thought these looked weird wen I took them out of the package, but they were even weirder when I tried them on. First, the material is sort of stiff and scratchy, even after washing, the fabric is not soft and comfortable. The zipper pouch is just in a weird place. These also shrank in length and possible width in the first couple of washings. I highly recommend passing on these.",0
2,"These are really thin but I was ok with that.  The quality of the stitching is terrible and crooked and it bunches around the waistband.  I would say this is worth $10 at most.  Size medium was recommended for me (5‚Äô7‚Äù 135 lbs, 34B). I ordered a large. I could barely get it on. I exchanged for an XL and it wasn‚Äôt any bigger. I returned that too and it‚Äôs probably all in the landfill now. The only positive was the colors are pretty.",0
3,Returned ... Not the fit or quality I expected.,0
5,Beautiful,1
2,The shirt was a little bit stiff and had a weird smell I laundered it and it is not a fabric I would recommend stiff and scratchy would not buy again,0
2,I ordered an XL when I normally wear M to L in hoodies. It is still too small.  Love the color.  Ended up giving it to my niece.,0
2,Design is nice but  sweatshirt is too thin,0
4,I like the comfort of the hoodie...i dont the fact that it gets lint balls under the arms easily,1
5,"First impression - I love it! Fits perfectly. I ordered a small 5'4"" 118lbs. Great for work or a night out.",1
2,"A bit larger than another set we bought & liked. The smaller ones in this set are cute, but the larger they get, the more you can see they look a bit clumsy.<br />Also, the 2 linked (chained?) pins make no sense for Christmas: a black & gold bear linked to a Christmas tree that‚Äôs smaller than the bear? A red-bonneted pig linked to an apple?<br />Oh and the smaller pins have the butterfly clutch tie tack type. The larger pins have the pin backs with safety catch bar.",0
3,Just ok,0
3,"Pretty good, but don't seem to be made so well. I hope they don't break quickly. I hope they last for a while",0
4,Good,1
5,Love the colors,1
5,Fits much better than the band that came on  watch,1
1,"I might have kept this watch, but I could not adjust the length. There‚Äôs a little screwdriver in the box, but no directions for usage. My husband worked with it a long time and never got it to adjust.",0
5,Love love loveeee it! Very nice fit. My husband loves it!,1
5,I was pleasantly surprised. This shirt is a nicer quality than similar UGG sleep shirt.<br />Please add more colors :),1
5,"This is a Christmas gift, so I do not know yet if it fits.",1
1,One glove dead on arrival - power light did not come on. Contacted company - no response? Sending back,0
3,Would get a bigger size,0
5,"Love this shirt. The length is great, and material is so soft. I haven‚Äôt washed yet, but so far I love it! I sized down from what Amazon recommended and I‚Äôm glad. It runs a little big so the smaller size was perfect.",1
1,"These were such a disappointment. I'm a 22/24 and after reading the other reviews, I decided to order the 5XL (I'm normally a 3XL). They were so extremely unflattering. The back pockets sat on the back of my thighs instead of my rear. They were made VERY VERY small....I ordered 2 sizes bigger than usual and they were still a tight fit. Zipper was super cheap as was the button. The entire pair of jeans was made incredibly cheaply. I had such high hopes for these and they were a total let down.",0
3,"The size ran smaller than expected.  I can still wear it, but it's a little snug.",0
2,to small for my husbands neck,0
4,It came alot earlier then expected. It looked really nice an polished when i opened the packaging. Nothing was broken so that was a plus because of the price. I liked it so much i plan on ordering another one,1
5,Great dress. Comfortable and looks great on. Received several compliments.,1
5,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, its lovely. she loves it",1
5,This purse is perfect for the horse lover.  Very good quality.,1
5,"These are my favorite bottoms of all times!  I might own at least 10 pair between the joggers and the capris in this same style. Now, I wish they made them in just a regular hemmed bottom. That would be amazing! I would probably own one in every color then!",1
3,Would not buy again. Does not fit face and sucks in with breath.,0
2,Nice...but way to small to read.  It's like a watch for a child...not a grown man,0
5,Love it! I had to buy it for a music festival due to their new bag rules. Held up for the four days we were there. Good quality üëçüèª,1
3,"the fit was weird, not for hippy ladies",0
1,I ordered a 2x  .. it was at best a med ! Very poor quality .. I gave 1 star because package  arrived very quickly .,0
1,Looks like an old tablecloth .. cheap and seethrough .. no lining .. will use as a home dress .. good for nothing else !,0
5,This is my second Paul Malone tie with the same pattern but different color. I get complimented on it every time I wear it and it's a perfect fit.,1
4,"I was trying to upload a picture but it did not let me, however the bracelet is beautiful. I just wish it was welded as stated because I know I will loose the charmsü•∫. That's the reason I bought it ü§ûüèΩ",1
5,Great cover up,1
2,The jewel is microscopic. Bought it for a Monroe piercing and it won‚Äôt even work,0
1,Wore this necklace for two weeks and it became tarnished. Cheap materials. Returned.,0
1,"Be aware that the &#34;white&#34; is much more like light silver making the tie look cheap, otherwise it is okay",0
5,"I've ordered 2 bands of different sizes from this seller. Well worth it, great quality.",1
5,"This is so beautiful!  I actually ordered two more (have received them already!  I really love the chiffon and the full colors!  A wardrobe staple, it wont go out of style.  Love it!!!",1
2,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù 135 lbs and ordered a small. The fit was perfect, snug but not obnoxiously so. The material was soft but thin and a bit cheap feeling. I had to trim off lots of thread at the seams. Overall ok for what I paid.",0
5,Great fit! Good quality! I get a lot of compliments on this shirt.,1
2,Runs small!,0
3,Ok,0
5,"I like that this is snuggly, not too tight and not too big. Just perfect for my 4 years old to keep himself warm. And the price is worth it.",1
5,Pretty nice as stretchy. I wear it with tights,1
3,"Definitely runs small. Sleeves are short on my arms. The &#34;white&#34; is not white, it's very much cream. Cute, soft, and lightweight.",0
5,Loved how this fit and super comfy could be an everyday shirt or dressed up. Felt like it was very true to color online. Loved the blue for a different color in my closet.,1
4,Loved this. Seemed like great quality and it's very cute. Ran a little big.,1
3,Ok fit,0
2,it's way too small,0
1,Small and cheaply made.  Adjusted it to the largest setting and it‚Äôs still too small.,0
5,"Perfect size, absorbent , on time shipping, and not cheap fabric, this a great buy.",1
1,A bit narrow. Not easy to walk in like other slippers. Fairly warm but not what I expected.,0
2,"I give it 2 stars because it's actually a nice looking watch case. The main gripe I have is this winder is ONLY functional with the SPIN-R mobile app, and there is no way to interface with the winder without it. Therefore, if the app doesn't work properly (which has been me experience more often than not) the watch winder becomes useless. But hey, at least you have a nice looking holder.<br />When the interface does work it leaves many questions to trial and error because the instructions are lacking. Such simple things as; does the winder still function if not connected to phone by bluetooth are left to the consumer to figure out because the instructions do not include much information on the actual day to day operation. You're pretty much told plug it in, download the app, turn it on and use the app. Also it is clear the instructions were not written by somebody with a strong command of the english language. This may be just a pet peeve of mine but it shows a lack of attention to detail and attention to detail is something I would expect for a device most likely used to maintain higher end time pieces.<br />Often the buttons on the app do not work, or take forever to load. If you look at the app on the app store the third picture is of the main interface screen, you will notice the spinning circle in the center meaning it is trying to load (see attached screen shot). So I'm guessing whomever took the pics was experiencing the same issues I was and they just gave up waiting for it to load and just took the picture.<br />On a positive note, the watch winder is ascetically pleasing and seems to be of decent construction.<br /><br />In conclusion I believe this winder has potential, but is not ready for release to the mass market. The ability to control with the app should be a feature, and not the only way to control the winder. There should be controls on the winder to enable manual input so the winder would always be functional.",0
2,The watch lost color quick,0
5,Love them,1
5,It's a beautiful dress but I was unsure of the sizing and I lost weight so going to try a couple sizes down.,1
3,Larger top. Should have ordered a size down. Material is on the cheap side.,0
4,Strap keeps slipping out of loop,1
1,"Didn‚Äôt like the material. Top was way to tight, I‚Äôm not big chested so that was unexpected. Waist and length was fine, but can‚Äôt wear it because of the top.",0
5,Bought it for my wife as a gift. She loved it.,1
1,These are not tummy control these are junk their paper-thin they are a piece of crap I'm sending them back,0
5,"Extremely comfortable. I'm using it as shower shoes while I'm in the desert. Its good for walking over big rocks, but the front has a tendency to scoop sand up more than the $1 shower sandals that they sell at the BX. I'm still overall satisfied with this purchase.",1
2,Like the fact that its pack able but the wrinkles don't fall out. It lost it shape! I would like it better if it retained it shape.,0
4,It's wide at the arm holes - to the point where it buckles out.,1
1,"it&#34;s too small and the material is too sorft, feels like it would tear easily",0
5,We‚Äôve got this order and just loved it. We are saving it for our Christmas<br />Party this year. It also matches well with our other Christmas paper products and invitations.,1
2,It was not that great. The handle was rough to hold,0
5,"thank you for your generosity , great attention and were very responsible",1
5,"Great watch, really water proof. Strap sucks though, but the watch itself is well worth the price.",1
5,"This product quality were great because the leather was soft, the colour made it look more beautiful and the price were affordable.",1
5,"This is the most comfortable robe ever. I wear it just to relax in, to and from the shower, I love it!!",1
1,Setting fell out not good thing especially at xmas time,0
5,Good stuff,1
5,Beautiful watch. Gotta it for my gf and she loved it. It‚Äôs a magnetic band so it can easily be fitted to any wrist size.,1
5,"Impressed by the high quality of the leather and design.  Even the packaging is superb.  If you only need 5 or 6 cards and a few bills, this is an excellent wallet.  I don‚Äôt even notice it in my front pocket.  I carry a key card as well and it is not effected by the RFID blocking.",1
5,"I love this swimsuit! I am 5'3&#34; and around 113 pounds, and a small fit perfectly. I love the strappy look of this swimsuit. It is very flattering on, especially around the hips. The multiple straps on the hips really helps hide any problem areas! The only issue that I had is that when I first ordered this swimsuit, I received a top that was missing one of the hooks for the white straps that go over the shoulders, so I was unable to secure it. However, I returned the suit, received a refund, and ordered another because I loved it so much, and the second one I received had no issues whatsoever!<br /><br />Overall, I suggest going with your gut size-wise. I was unsure about ordering a small since some of the other reviews mentioned the suit running small. However, a small fit me perfectly and wasn't too tight anywhere- it fit like a glove! The suit material feels nice and like it will stand the test of time and chlorine or saltwater. I highly recommend this suit to anyone looking for a new one! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1
3,They were ok,0
2,"Such a beautiful pieces but it is very fragile.. within two weeks of wearing it, it broke.",0
2,"the picture looks better than product, this necklace doesn't show very well in real life, it isn't very well made, the way it goes on it takes a lot of adjusting to get the Avant guard look like the picture, I will say its okay, but it looks cheap to me.<br />the proximity of the stand up part of the necklace is awkward, and you really have to keep arranging. if you don't mind that, go for it, but like me I want to put on and go.",0
1,"I ordered 3 masks on Sept 12.  They were suppose to be delivered a week ago and they haven‚Äôt showed up.  Don‚Äôt buy, you‚Äôll never get them!",0
5,Medal was as advertised and of good quality. Bought to give for confirmation gift to a young friend.,1
1,Poor fit. Extremely uncomfortable and constrictive.,0
4,As described seems to be good quality and works well.,1
3,Nice top. Bought XXXL for my wife.  Had to give it to my 17 y.o. daughter,0
1,Rose gold plating started turning black within a week. Don't recommend.,0
5,"Loved this dress, but cut in waist smaller than expected. I ordered a Large, but will need an XL",1
5,These suits are great for a longer torso. I was very happy to find them on Amazon.,1
3,"Thin material, not the greatest quality but it was a gift for my son who's a big MacBeth fan.<br />I would probably only buy another if it were on sale.",0
5,"Absolutely love this hat! Perfect for Fourth of July, or any day that isn't the Fourth of July. 'MERICA!",1
1,The shorts are too big,0
4,"I ordered these to wear on extremely cold days. With previous reviews saying they run really small I had ordered a large. I am 5'2"" 120 lbs and usually wear a small, size 26/27 or a size 2/4. I like how soft they are. There is some stretch and the waist is big on me but that normally happens because my waist is extra small. The thigh area was comfortable. I think if I buy again I will try the medium instead. Maybe if it was a little snugger it would keep me warmer.",1
4,"I love this, but it seems to be a little smaller than the size chart says.  If you want it to be a little loose, size up.",1
4,I baught this because its 31 in long with a big opening size.great to travel because of the shorter length.its made well i can not stand fold up umbrellas like the handle and it has a fiberglass shaft,1
3,"I ordered ""tomato red"" and got ""traffic cone orange"". I used it on a couple bike rides; it was dripping wet on the inside at the end of the rides, there was very little breathability compared to other jackets. I am keeping it as a rain jacket as it's got decent weather resistance and packs down to a small size, but overall it's disappointing.",0
5,Right size  good looking,1
3,"The shirt feels good, but is a little too snug for my liking.",0
5,I absolutely love this pair of glasses. They are not only practical but also extremely stylish. I am a sunglass collector (hoarder) and this is my favorite pair. They come in an awesome case and also include a cleaning cloth. They are very lightweight. They are functional without being heavy weight. The arms are just the right lenth for different faces. Not overly long or short. The nose rest is comfortable without pinching and causing sweat to collect or rub. And they really help cut the glaring sunlight better than most when outside. Not to forget the beautiful reflection that is seen in the lenses. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy a great pair of sunglasses.<br />I received this product at a discounted price for my fair and unbiased opinion.,1
1,Won‚Äôt fit,0
5,Super soft and comfy,1
2,"Great quality. Bought a medium and it would fit an extra large!!!! Runs really, really big!!",0
3,"I was REALLY excited about this when I opened it... lovely packaging, beautiful color... nice width... THEN I put it on.  Firstly, I have small wrists.  I have already returned it, and wish I had taken a picture of it on to better explain.  It was just SO TIGHT.  I didn't need lotion or anything to get it off, but I was expecting it to fit more like a fun bangle as described.  Like... I thought it would at least move some when I moved my arm, but it was STUCK.  If this is what you want, go for it. I mean, I didn't want something that would just slip off, but this things wasn't going ANYWHERE unless I pulled HARD and it did not feel good.  It is also HEAVY.  I just don't like tight heavy bracelets. If you have thick wrists or bigger hands in ANY WAY, you will NOT be able to put this on/take this off.",0
5,These are very well made and perfect for our toddlers tea party.  Fit little heads quite nicely.,1
2,Front of hat pokes up high bill seems a little long for me,0
1,Feet hurt after a few hours . Not the product i expected.,0
1,"I does not fit like the picture, its a baggy heavy blouse with cuts in the arms. Can not return it because I'm not in the US.",0
3,very pretty BUT they sent me a pair where one of em didn't have the rhinestones:/ really? if i buy another pair i can only hope its the same but otherwise i still will be stuck with an odd pair. pretty tho.,0
3,"Good quality dress. I'm a 4 normally and ordered the small, which fit perfectly. I didn't, however, like the style. The neckline was closer to my neck than anticipated, and the hemline longer. Overall a very pretty dress, just not for me.",0
4,"Thinner than I expected them to be, but they work great and haven't had any issues with them.",1
2,"I ordered the 4 pack that is described to include 1 black pair, 1 gray, 1 burgundy, and 1 olive. I was sent a brown pair instead of the olive green. Big fail on the sellers part. These were also huge on me in the whole top portion, especially the waist. I am normally a size small in leggings, but am not super skinny by any means, so these should've fit nicely. These leggings will likely only fit a size medium or large, and no one who is petite. I am 5'2'' and 125lbs.",0
5,Beautiful watch band. Worth the money,1
5,I am a repeat buyer of this item because I am that happy with it. They're warm socks and don't slide down.,1
5,"Look, I didn't expect much for what I paid, which wasn't much.  But I needed a hat that fits and stays on, with a decent size brim and neck coverage from the killer sun and this works perfectly.  The little scarf in the back doesn't stay put really well, but it's a nice color and it provides decent coverage.  This hat is great for gardening or walking to get the mail and I'm very pleased with it",1
5,"OMG, I loved this dress. The best choice for office style. Got many compliments from my colleagues",1
5,Love the socks!,1
5,"The first time I bought one of these was in Ocean City Maryland, on the boardwalk. I wanted to get some more, but knew I wouldn't be back in OC, MD for a long time, so I searched online and finally found them. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. I ordered seven of these in different colors. The only problem is the little gem in the middle fell out of four of them. So, I will have to glue that back on.",1
5,This is a really nice cloth i use it regularly and its my go to cloth for polishing silver before this i used micro fiber but switched to this after using someones polish cloth and realize this is better.,1
5,cheap and cute...,1
1,Broke in a week.  Cheaper made than gas station glasses.,0
1,Not really what i expected material to thin,0
2,Very thin material.,0
5,"I am enjoying my new wrist pad as I type this message!  Good quality, especially for the price paid for the item.  Exactly what I needed.",1
3,I purchased this top for yoga. I was pleased with the purchase but it may have been after a wash and dry that I found the fit too small and I reordered to the larger size.,0
1,The dress material is thick and makes you look like you‚Äôre a sack of potatoes.,0
5,Very light and yet thick enough to repell the rain.,1
5,"Wore this to a Christmas party, the color is vibrant and beautiful! Material is lightweight and stretchy, just wear a slip under.",1
2,"The ""clear"" lenses are much too tinted in low light setting. Buy better quality photochromatic lenses, you won't be sorry.",0
1,"I bought an xl in this dress. I can usually bounce around between large and xl. It was a joke when I tried to but this dress on. It didn't come anywhere near closing, like barely around my waist. I looked at the measurements before buying and this was way off. So off it was practically comical. I don't know if the wrong label was attached to the dress or what, but needless to say I returned it.",0
5,Just adorable for 2nd grade play,1
3,"they are cute,",0
5,I love this bathing suit it covers everything I needed it to I bought a xl I‚Äôm 5‚Äù8 I was 230 at the time of this picture I‚Äôve lost weight and it still fits beautiful,1
4,Arrived as advertised,1
1,Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever ordered on Amazon.,0
3,"I like the bathing suit that I received. But, it wasn‚Äôt the one pictured, when I ordered. The straps and back are very different.",0
5,Real deal.  The clear one was huge.  The purple one was really nice.  Gave that one to my daughter.,1
1,"Do not buy, not worth what they are charging! Will not buy again, so cheaply made it's falling apart!",0
5,Very cute necklace and lovely accents. Nice touch to a dainty outfit. Doesn't overdue the look but adds a nice touch,1
1,One pair of glasses were completely scratched up on one lense straight out of the package,0
5,"Three words come to mind when describing this product, unique , distinct & stylish.",1
2,"So....<br />The people who made this do not know how a humans head or face is generally shaped.<br />I was able to make it work for a photo shoot sort of, but I'll never wear it again and will be buying one of higher quality.",0
1,First of all I ordered these jeans and paid extra to get hem next day shipping.... That didn't happen. When I did get them they were not a crispy white but I could've worked with that had they got past my ankle. I'm usually a size 8 and after reading reviews I saw they ran small. I ordered an XL and I don't know who on this planet is wearing an XL this small. I now have to return them and I hate having to go through the hassle of returning items. I had to go out and buy a pair of jeans which was what I was trying to avoid.,0
4,godd just a tad small for my liking.,1
1,Opened the package and the tag in the shirt was cut in half so you couldn‚Äôt see the size of shirt. Looking at the shirt you could clearly see it was not a 3x like ordered. My husband only wears a 2x but likes them roomy. He tried it on and it was not even a xl. There is no way to prove this size of shirt. You can lay it up again this other 2x and 3x and it‚Äôs smaller than them all! Who sends a new shirt with the tag cut in half out of it to hide the size knowing it‚Äôs not what the customer ordered. When we opened it we knew something was off. We didn‚Äôt even take the time to call amazon over 20.00 but wanted to warn others. We will gift it to the needy.,0
1,The ankle elastic is way too tight. Had to cut and replace it. Whose baby has thin ankles?,0
3,"I thought it was more yellow, but it was more orange.<br />Has a good fit. I was worth the price for Polyester.",0
5,"Love the look, light weight, very pleased with this product,",1
1,"I'm not sure if I received the wrong color item or if the color depicted in the image is simply inaccurate, but I ordered the burgundy which looks like a deep and predominantly violet-red color and mine is much brighter and much more red.",0
5,"Love this camisole,it gives just the right amount of support not giving up comfort.",1
5,"My wife has a very small wrist, had to remove 4 links. The links are very easy to remove. She loves how it looks. Gives the watch a whole new look. The hardest part was taking the protective plastic off the links lol.",1
3,I received my order today. I was thrilled that it arrived early. However I was really disappointed when I opened them up and noticed that they looked like a pair of hand me downs. The underarmour logo and the R on the leg was stretched out and had a bunch of cracks. The pants overall are comfy. I read that they ran large and ordered a size down and they are still a little on the big side.,0
3,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 220lbs and curvy. Breast & butt. The material is a type of rough cotton with no stretch. Was tight in the bust area but not exactly suffocating. The length was about mid thigh....just gotta make sure I don‚Äôt drop anything in public!,0
5,My mom loved these as part of her Xmas present. They look extremely well made and like they will last for years.,1
5,Great colors<br />Great fit,1
3,Very pretty but much larger than they look and much too heavy for me to wear.,0
1,This was an awkward fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 150 lbs. I have a little curve in the hips but this dress made me look pretty wide. Not flattering. The crochet on the top slouched. I was really sad. Not to mention the slip barely covers your goods,0
3,Fades very quickly,0
5,Great glasses. Just what was needed. Thank you.,1
3,A bit snug under arm area.,0
3,It's a nice looking clicker! Just runs a little big large for my taste. Every time I move my head it wiggles a bunch,0
5,The shirt washes great and has not faded,1
3,"[[VIDEOID:edc0209d8f650a86588532d12f65b45]] As my title states, the costume is actually very nice. It fits well, and the design is actually present. But‚Ä¶ the hat‚Ä¶ the hat had hot glue strings everywhere and the hot glue is visible on almost every place it‚Äôs used. It is fine for camera, but looks cheap up close.",0
3,They are for wide heels,0
1,Just took it out of the package and someone has totally cut bottom of the shirt it‚Äôs shredded it‚Äôs total crap.,0
3,Thought it‚Äôs be a cute oversized jacket but it just looked dull,0
4,Gift,1
2,Earrings are light weight and pretty however they bend easily and I had a stone fall out.  Good for the occasional special wear may not be able to withstand being put on and off on a daily basis which is what I used them for.,0
5,Thick but comfortable.  Most comfortable mask I have worn.,1
5,"This watch is perfection!  I'm a gal who collects men's watches and this Nixon Ranger may be my new favorite. It's heavy, solid and looks seriously awesome on my tiny 6"" wrist.  I love the brushed stainless steel case and bracelet.  Rugged, beautiful perfection.",1
1,"[[VIDEOID:fd1d3593c2789a1b9eb0d3a4a9f9aac5]] I don‚Äôt even know if this dress fits, because I refuse to put it on as it is. The packaging was opened but glued back together in a messy way.<br /><br />Then the dress was inside-out. I was disgusted and shocked to find thick white deodorant stains under the arm and all the way down the sides of the dress. I have never seen such awful presentation from any Amazon seller. No one checked the product??? I needed this for an event. I‚Äôm really annoyed!",0
4,Exactly as described -  I bought this with the matching chain/medallion as accessories for my Halloween pimp costume - Very happy with it!,1
1,These look Nothing like the picture!!!!<br />DULL.  NO FACETS.  NO SHINE.  VERY UGLY.<br />I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR.  CHEAP.,0
2,They were really cute and I got compliments on them..but they started to fall apart the first time I wore them.,0
5,"They work just fine, not stiff like some mentioned and it stays on the shirt button.  A good price and you get two!",1
5,Just wish fabric was a little heavier,1
4,nice but the color is weird very yellowish,1
1,Not very good quality.,0
4,Beautiful! !!,1
4,Good,1
5,"My best friend is obsessed with cats, and she fell in love with this product.",1
3,Turned brown in pool,0
5,"Their awesome, only downside is because their wood, they slide off my face a little easier than I'd like. Not the end of the world, I love them otherwise.",1
5,Love it!,1
1,To small. Hard to get on,0
2,"These tore on my first use. I know they‚Äôre only $7 but they should last longer than that. Also, they run a small which probably contributed to the tearing. I‚Äôm a size 9 and bought a medium. I should have bought a large.",0
1,"Blouse material is ok, but the skirt material is so cheap and old fashioned",0
5,"lovely top, fits well",1
5,"I will be purchasing more, way more comfortable than expected.",1
5,very nice and warm,1
5,Lightweight extra soft material.  Will be perfect for after surgery for an extended hospital visit.  Why not be as comfortable as possible?,1
3,SHIRT FIT AS EXPECTED,0
5,"Well made, just not as big as I thought it would be but that's my fault for not looking at the description. Over all perfect purse.",1
5,"I bought a bunch of these in different styles. Love them. Soft, comfortable, flowy, flattering. They do wrinkle, which is a little annoying, but just don't leave them in the bottom of the laundry basket for days like I do.",1
4,"I absolutely love it,I want to buy some more. The only thing that would make it perfect for me is if the strap length&#34; although is the best I have found so far&#34; where if the length could be around 4&#34; longer if possible. Like I said love it,would like more of them. Thank You for your product,and speedy delivery.",1
5,Did not fit as per size stated but made nice,1
5,Really cute slippers. Fit as expected and really comfortable. Thank you for the excellent service.,1
1,"Seemed like alot of pressure for a 6 month old, the package states for 8+ month but I didn't see that in the description. Put them on our girl and she started crying until I took them off.",0
5,Love these 90 Degree by Reflex Yoga Capris.  A perfect fit every time.,1
1,I didn‚Äôt like these sunglasses at all.  They were very cheap and flimsy looking.  I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôm too snobby with sunglasses - I can wear expensive to $10 pairs.  But these went straight in the trash.  They looked terrible.,0
1,Is not the same material as the original,0
3,"The sleeves are a completely different fabric.  Not what I expected, however, I do love it!!",0
2,"I love it , but broke",0
4,"Didn't care for the material or the tie in the front, returned.",1
4,"Works decent as a summer cover for arm tattoos, though you can still slightly see my bright colors. Might be because my arms are bigger and material is stretched thin. Also getting black.",1
2,"The bust measurements were entirely off, and the blouse was so small I couldn‚Äôt get it over my boobs. The skirt bottom was also not correct in measurement - the bottoms were so big I couldn‚Äôt keep them on, they would fall right down.",0
5,Looks and fits great....  No size issue..... Will buy again.....,1
1,This is that shiny material not sweat shirt material.  Does not feel soft and comfortable,0
2,Too big but the my size,0
3,Same product my optometrist carries.,0
2,"Doesn't fit well.. loose, falls down",0
3,just ok for the price.  String is too weak so I had to change it.  Pendent itself is good,0
1,Very big binder for a big wallet.,0
2,It's clear glass. Looks like the back was painted with a brush  with red and blue paint.,0
4,"its very soft and i like them alot but burrs and other things can get easily stuck to the outside or inside and the fluff can come apart and 'shed'. however, these werent very big issues and were overall comfy and fun to wear",1
5,Perfect fit even after getting washed.,1
3,"These were fine, but I felt a little mislead. They are basically cardboard emoji's glued to some foam, so to make them thicker and less tear-able. They were just fun props for a Photo Booth, so they worked just fine. But dont be fooled, they are very basic.",0
1,Broke after a month holding costa sunglasses. Junk,0
2,I was very disappointed in the fit of this dress.  It runs very small.  I returned the dress.,0
1,"Too small! The flowy part is not as long as it is on the model! In fact, it went just below the boobs. Disappointed to say the least.",0
5,Attractive and nicely made.,1
2,no es tan buena calidad y es muy peque√±o,0
1,Short and 2 different colors.,0
5,This item is cute for Sherlock Holmes fans.  Not going to find this in a store.,1
2,"This product, while comfortable and really warms your feet, is built from really poor quality sewing. Once you put your feet inside the hole one of the slipper's back portion tore open, so we stitched it up. However after being in use only during the night for 2 weeks the back of the head portion also tore open.<br /><br />I would not condemn the sellers selling this product, but rather the makers (Wishpets). Please proceed with caution when buying these slippers.",0
2,My teenage daughter couldn't get it past her hips and she purchased a size up from her regular size.,0
5,She never wears it bc she‚Äôs fake but it‚Äôs pretty and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap,1
3,"I didn‚Äôt like the material, how it fitted, it was somewhat cheesy/cheap, I returned item, don‚Äôt like to give bad reviews but just keeping it real.",0
3,"Not stretchy at all, had to cut the strap and add elastic in order to fit it over my daughter's arms.  Everywhere else is sized proportionally but the lack of elasticity in the straps makes it way too tight. If we didn't alter, it would have been unusable.",0
1,This chain is Fake.,0
1,Necklace was broken when I opened it.,0
3,"Fits great, timely delivery. But there's no logo on the back? The one on the front is already kind of faded. I'm a little dissappointed because I expected a logo on the back as well.",0
2,"These shed so bad and within minutes, the ears looked horrible! The ‚Äúfur‚Äù looked like a bad haircut! Once all the shedding fake fur is gone, they might look better.",0
5,Very comfortable shorts. Fits best when ordering a size up. Definitely can‚Äôt beat the price of these. I would recommend washing in cold water and line/air dry.,1
2,"I gave this two stars simply because it seems like it's at least decently made. Other than that, the shirt looks completely different in person- I was expecting a cute, girly t-shirt with flowers on it but the actual shirt feels cheap and slinky- like granny PJ's. The print also looks different- looks granny-ish and not like in picture.",0
5,Happy Wife,1
1,I bought these as a gift but the item I received was defective. The lenses were a cheap quality one of them was popped out of the frame and would not pop back in. I returned this item for a refund. It's really inconvenient because now I have to find another gift for this person last minute.,0
1,Ordered 5/8 and recieved something way too big,0
5,Very pretty! Doesn't turn my ears green amd they sparkle.,1
1,The bow fell off as soon as we opened it. Matorral thin and skirt sewed together so I had to undo the stitches from the inside to try it on.,0
1,Not floor length at all. Midi at best. Cheap product do not waist your money,0
2,easy wear out,0
3,Nice casual look,0
5,"Just as advertised.  I love the shape, I love the material, and I love the fit.  It is a big hat though - probably close to 7 3/4.",1
5,"Their customer service is excellent.  I wear XL but it was too small.  I called customer service in China.  I paid to return the XL to New Jersey and they sent me an XXL.  It still was a little too snug.  I gave away as a give and bought another product that fit perfectly.  It did work good, but sizing is way off.",1
1,Seem like it is made for a lady...,0
3,I really love this shirt but it is sewn in a way that makes the Hem roll and makes it look kind of messy,0
2,Awful fabric and pattern..,0
5,look good and fit is amazing,1
4,nice light weight jacket.,1
4,Really cute but I wish the suspenders were of better quality. The straps were fraying almost immediately after putting them on and they wouldn‚Äôt stay at the size we adjusted because the metal adjuster is too loose and slides out of place. The outfit itself fit well and was adorable.,1
1,These pants are completely see through.,0
5,Very cute and well made pendant! Little girl who received it as a gift was absolutely happy!,1
5,This is sooo cute! I gave it to my best friend as a gift and she absolutely loved it! we went out and she go so many compliments on it! I honestly want to buy one for my self now! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!,1
5,Good price for a daily / at work to use sunglasses.  Considering my work demands lots of outdoor activities in a rough environment good quality,1
4,"This is a very nice piece of costume jewelry. I used it, and a few other pieces purchased on Amazon, for a photoshoot. It was worth the buy.",1
4,I feel the brim is perfect for me. Not huge and not small. I‚Äôm enjoying the tie. If I want to take it off I can. The weight of the hat is not heavy. Color is good too.,1
5,"Good length, nice and also very bright print.",1
3,"Looks nice on, loose around the stomach hiding small tummies.  However, you must iron as it comes out of the dryer very wrinkled.  Light green is a pleasant color.",0
5,"I originally saw this ring at our local Jewelery for $350. When I saw it online for $50, I didn't think there was any way it could be the same ring, but I decided to risk it. The ring came in 2 days, and is exactly the same ring! I even asked my jeweler if there was some difference in the quality of metal, or some explanation for the dramatic difference in price, and she said nope- get the cheaper ring, because it's even below cost for them! Both my fiance and I are thrilled with it- it looks stunning on his finger, has a nice weight to it, and fits perfectly. The sizing matched exactly with the size he was fitted for at the Jeweler.",1
5,It was everything plus more that I wanted. Felt wonderful on my skin. Great price. Did I mention that it has a pocket????,1
4,Thin but worked fine with a long tank top underneath. Can‚Äôt beat the price,1
5,"Absolutely perfect fit, beautiful color and style for a graduation dress",1
1,Broke within first day of use,0
5,Bought this hat for my son who has the jacket.,1
3,"The band is heavy and you will notice the weight when movements of your wrist make the watch shift around a little.  There could and SHOULD be a guide estimating the number of links you should remove for your measured wrist size.  My wrist is about 170 mm and I removed 5 links for an approximate fit that is not too tight. The pin removal tool is terrible. When you lay the band in the tool, the pin in the link doesn‚Äôt align with the tool you twist to push it out.  AND when you remove a pin, it sometimes has to be forced out and you bend it so that it can‚Äôt  be reused.  AND, when you replace a pin after removing a link, it will NOT<br />go back in the direction the instructions indicate; there is a slightly wider part of each pin and it must go back in with that part LAST, not first.  Otherwise you WILL bend the pin because you can‚Äôt use the tool until it is almost fully in, and if you try to put it back in wider part first it resists and trying to force it will bend it. So, adjusting links is trial and error, and made more difficult by a poorly designed tool and directions that don‚Äôt work well.",0
3,"These socks fit loosely, which I kind of like since I don't like socks that bind, but they are scratchy and the stitching at the toes is wonky, which makes them hard to wear by themselves for the whole day.  However, with a thin liner sock underneath, these are decent boot socks since they have the Ragg look and are a nice length so that they rise above my ankle boots.  The liner sock is also necessary because even though these socks aren't exactly thin, they aren't all that warm, either, since the weave is kind of loose.  I don't think I would buy them again, but I can make them work for my purposes.",0
5,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous.  I wondered if it would look big and gaudy, but it's the perfect size and it looks elegant like it could be an antique.  It sparkles like CRAZY in the sunlight!",1
5,Beautiful,1
5,"I love Paz Creations, have for many years. This heart pendent is beautiful, very unique and I am very happy that I made the purchase. I would recommend Paz Creations to everyone. Very beautiful jewelry at extremely affordable prices.",1
1,NOT HAPPY I ordered this I an XXL because I have a DD chest.  Well I was disappointed to see the cup size was probably a B.  Really an XXL with a B cup?  The torso is way to long.,0
5,"Everyone gives me a hard time for wearing this, but IT IS DURABLE, great for a cookout, EASY TO WASH and care for. All I can say is Flavortown is the place to be. But if you want i'll bbq like my dad did. Just call the fire dept ahead of time. Otherwise, When I cook with this on, You could eat my offerings off a flip-flop",1
5,Fit well thanks,1
5,-Brown color isn't as red in real life as the pics online at the various websites depict.<br />-But the boot is so so cute! They are different from your average brown booties.<br />-I am a size 7 w/ wide feet and the 7s for this boot fit true to size! Just like the other Ugg boots I have.<br />-Only strife is that they are a bit longer at the toe box but thats the style.<br />-No Ugg logo on the back of the boots. Leather strap attached to zipper.<br />-The gold lining is good quality and really stands out.,1
2,"some of the feathers on the hat were  not attached, hence reason for the return",0
3,"The are adjustable, but just not very bright.",0
2,"I thought these were great, but, my one year old broke them while just walking, on the 3rd wear.",0
2,"Fabric is cheap and the green color is brighter than it looks in the picture. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 140lbs and I can usually wear a small or medium, but this medium was very small on me.",0
5,Is made with a thicker chain for kids. Quality was better than expected for the price.,1
1,These socks were too short and not well made. They were uncomfortable as well,0
2,They are beautiful and they would be been perfect it it wasnt because the key chain pieces fell off,0
2,"I bought these because they were inexpensive for a costume I‚Äôd only wear once, so I didn‚Äôt expect them to be great quality. However, the quality is so poor that I didn‚Äôt get to wear them at all. I put them in on my way out the door, and within a few seconds, they were both sliding out of my ears. I went to push the backs on further only to realize the backs on both earrings had fallen out and gotten lost in the time it took me to walk from my front door to my car. They get two stars for being as described and because if you have extra earring backs lying around, they are still usable, but I will be returning them.",0
2,A little too big.,0
1,these jeggings were way to small they are made for a person who wear a size 0. will never order again from this company. I throw them in the trash where they belong.,0
2,In less than 24 hours an arm broke off; and in less than 48 hours both were busted. You'll find better glasses at the dollar store üò§üò°,0
5,Works great with the versa.,1
2,"Pattern is very cute, quality is quite decent, comes in an adorable box. They are just HUGE GRANNY PANTIES. I thought they'd fit more hipster like title",0
5,Love it.,1
1,Too Small,0

1,Product runs large!,0
5,Luved it,1
1,returned,0
4,I still rate this product 4 stars because it is of exceptional quality! I ordered Large according to the size chart but found it to be snug in the arms and big around the hips. It works though because you can really dress it up and accessorize. I will be purchasing another!,1
5,Beautiful,1
2,"The dress was way too short.  I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and bought a larger size, hoping that would help.  Also the neckline plunges considerably more than the picture indicated.  It‚Äôs going back.",0
5,Excellent cover for rating when riding my bike,1
5,Super cute. They look kinda vintagie but they match with different shades of clothing. I love them and they don't scratch her head or irritate her at all.,1
3,"Good, but, not as sturdy or functional as the &#34;Bags for LessTM - Gymnast Weather Resistant Travel Duffle.&#34;  Bottom doesn't have a reinforcing insert.  Definitely not as sturdy.  Donated extra to a school rummage sale.",0
1,arrived torn! It is very cute in person though. :( I really wanted to like this.,0

5,"Loose-fitting, casual and cute. Order your size for loose-fit and a size smaller for close-fit.",1
5,"the carabiner  is perfectly designed and heavy duty, should last a long time - i like that the part that holds the ring also opens to just slip on the key ring - BUT the rings it come with are awful, they have a slim rectangular design that wont fit some keys and have fairly sharp edges, i just threw them away and got some with round cross section and i have a key system that may last a lifetime",1
4,I ordered this for my fiance who wears a medium.  It was a roomy and long in the body and the sleeves were super long.  I think it belongs for sale as a big and tall item.  I can‚Äôt speak to the spf protection though I will say that the fabric is lightweight and breathable.  I didn‚Äôt care for the heathered raspberry red color however it is available in other colors.,1

5,"Yes I enjoyed it very much, so cool it glows in the dark.",1
5,Very strong durable well made belt,1
2,La tela es muy mala calidad y los colores muy p√°lidos,0
3,The actual product is much lighter in color like a light blue. Not bright as one shown! Hope wife likes it? Quality looks good tho.,0
3,This dress shows a bit too much cleavage for the office but it's an ok buy,0
5,"Price is reasonable, looks good and works good too.",1
5,Not as shiny as I expected but still super satisfied.,1
5,[[VIDEOID:98f31c4bea56ddf4aef5180cec0976f0]] Hermosa üòç me encanta‚ÄºÔ∏è,1
5,Cute,1
4,Very fast delivery!  Chain is both sturdy for some heavier pendants and delicate in appearance.  Very shiny white silver color.,1
5,It was so hard to find a NBA shirt in children size. My son was so excited!,1
5,Very nice stocking,1
5,I bought these as an emergency backup pair. I ended up using them as my primary gloves this winter because I loved them!,1
4,Very cute!!,1
2,"NATO straps just don't do it for me I guess. I just don't get their popularity at all. If you're into them, this one might work for you. It just didn't for me.",0
5,"Such a great ear piece! I wish I would have bought a second one though, such a great price too",1
4,I ordered this Invicta watch on Prime Day when there was quite a discount and it seemed like a good deal. Pay attention to the model's hands in the pictures! I thought this model was unisex but it's not. It's a man's watch and much too big for a woman's wrist. Had to return it. It's a beautuful watch but this model is certainly not for a small woman. I'll wait until the next Prime Day to order a more appropriate watch!,1
5,Love this sweater!  I bought 2 - one black and one yellow gold. Very soft and comfortable and reasonable price!  I would recommend buying!,1
5,Beautiful set and so inexpensive. We had a military ball that was 1940's themed. This was perfect. I would definitely recommend this.,1
5,Perfect size & fits on my shoulder nicely. Love it!,1
5,Love my purse. It is exactly the way the seller described it.,1
1,to small,0
1,"Bought this item for a trip overseas, not a durable product, the large size,one of the wheel was missing  when I picked up my luggage, the zipper on the medium size was ripped,on  the small one, the handle was stuck.",0
2,"The glasses are great and a real value on Amazon, but they are supposed to have a retention cord that fits into a slot in the arms. That was missing, and the box appeared to have been battered. Perhaps this was a returned item, or had been opened to appropriate the cord for another order.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cord for this is not available for purchase at Vuarnet USA or on the web.",0
3,Doesn‚Äôt have a good fit at all. Fits like a small not a medium.,0
4,"Cute, but a little hard to interpret.",1
5,"pretty sure my headline said it all. I got a Medium, I'm 5'5"" & 150lbs. fit perfect and comfortable.",1
5,Comfortable and looks great.,1
4,Outstanding quality everything I was expecting!!!,1
2,"I think that the design is great! I wore them in my beard and my locs, unfortunately the beads tarnished within a day or two. I typically don‚Äôt mind if metal jewelry tarnishes but these beads turned white and green, and some of the material seems to be ‚Äúflaking‚Äù off",0
5,Thank my grandma is going to love this,1
1,No era lo que esperaba Seve muy pl√°stico no me gusta,0
5,perfect for all the office staff,1
5,This product is very good resistente and confort√°vel as well. I used at gym and I liked very much!,1
1,"this bracelet is a pie of junk , had the bracelet  in  less than  20  days<br />98% of the cheap gold color  came off",0
1,"Got this for my boyfriend at Christmas. He never even got to use it. The moment this wallet was opened and one card was added, the spine snapped. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre beasts and slam cards into a wallet. The card was added to one pocket and the wallet fell apart. Garbage. I was very disheartened.",0
3,Much wider and less fitted than i thought they'd be,0
4,I‚Äôm 5ft 136lbs . And usually wear a small-medium on top and medium - large on bottom . Chose a medium so that it wouldn‚Äôt be so short . But I think I should have went with a small as I like dresses a little more fitted .It is a loose fit I think .  I will be keeping it because it‚Äôs only for a few hours or so . Not worth replacing to me . It will do the job.,1
4,"This blouse is really cute in person.  It probably runs a little bit big, but I like that in a button down blouse because I have problems in the chest area.  I will say the front is a little short which makes it hard to tuck in, if you wanted to.  I solved this by gathering the front hem, tying it with a clear hair tie and pulling the two ends so it looks like I knotted the front.  The sleeves are gathered at the shoulders so if you don't like that look this is not the top for you.  Can't wait to wear it on our Disney trip!",1
1,veryyy thin .tangle too much..,0
3,"I am a petite, short person with a fairly wide shoulders and a large bust. Over all this dress fits very well, but I am unable to wear it without a tank top underneath it because it shows almost my entire chest because of the wide v-neck",0
5,"These are superior to the  standard shirt stays. Other stays I've tried have a tendency to come loose, snag leg hair, and stretch over time. I've been using these for about a month and haven't experienced those issues a single time. The fabric feels very sturdy. I'll update this review if something changes but so far I'm very impressed.",1
5,Perfect for my cosplay!,1
5,The stockings are perfect.  I  am ordering more of this style.  Good price and perfect fit!!,1
3,"This shirt fit real tight, fabric was thin and spandex like. Also, it was short as well.",0
5,"Great look, great fit, great price and quality too!!",1
1,"Not what I was expecting, its not an actual ear cuff, its an eating. Because it is so heavy it does not stay up on your ear the way it is supposed to, and when it arrived my package was damaged and the stud for the earring was missing. Don't recommend to anybody, you could buy the same thing in a better quality for the same price at places like Claire's and hot topic.",0
1,I bought these for my husband for Christmas.  They run extremely large.  Had to send them back.,0
3,"I‚Äôm an XL. This Tee Shirt fits like a medium. I would suggest buying a size larger than you normally wear. The quality seems good, but the sleeves ride up a little higher than I expected.",0
3,"I was excited when I received my packing cubes but that excitement was short lived. I heard all about packing cubes from friends and coworkers and was excited to use it on my upcoming trip. However, after putting a couple of items in the toiletry bag it started to come apart at the seams. I think I received a lemon because new things aren't supposed to come apart like that. If you are afraid that these cubes could be too small, don't be. Before the issue with the toiletry bag, I didn't have to roll my clothes like I usually and everything fit. If it weren't for my issue then I would have probably kept the item.",0
4,Nice!,1
5,These pants seemed like a bit too loose initially but I find them very comfortable for lounging. I love the design and the fabric.  I have not tried wide leg pants before and I am very happy that I bought these. I wanted to buy another pair that is similar but in a different color but I couldn‚Äôt find it.,1
2,"While these are comfortable and very stretchy they are also extremely thin. I wouldn't recommend getting them if you were going to use them outside of your house. They would not be ideal for the gym, yoga, or walking and they do not stay up which is extremely annoying.",0
2,smell weird,0
2,"I can't argue with the value price of this item.  But it saddened me to see that the EMBLEM,  the most important feature,  was just an Iron-On Decal.  No embroidery.  I worry that it will peel off with just age/wear.",0
2,"The shirt is great, except the seashells are mostly white, not purple glitter as pictured.  IT looks like it's all fallen off before arriving!",0
5,Love them I work as a correctional officer and it is hot in dorms I didn't want to have to deal with sweaty stinky feet and these do the job,1
1,Very plastic like and stretches like a rubber band.<br /><br />Junk.,0
1,I wore the ring a few times and the silver began to wear off,0
5,"This outfit was a hit on my vacation to the beach. The colors are vibrant and fun, the material feels good on my skin, and I received compliment after compliment on this outfit. Definitely would buy another one as a matter of fact I bought three in different colors. Ladies you should do the same. This outfit is summer ready.",1
3,Just note the bands are true to size if you have a small wrist get small otherwise you‚Äôre gonna have a difficult time adjusting the band also they tend to get caught on objects and come apart probably after you‚Äôve worn them a while,0
1,"I found this dress to run small in some places and large in others. I wear a 10/12 and a C and am pretty evenly proportioned. The arms were tight, the bust lose, waist right, and lower half small. The fabric also felt very cheap & rough.",0
5,really pretty and sparkles,1
1,"La calidad deja mucho que desear. Muy delgada y cuando se calienta en el cuarto se agranda y se cae. Con esto basta, nada mas que decir",0
1,"I felt like it was so hot and the mask is not great quality so its a little weird on the face, just my experience",0
4,have to be careful if using socks on carpet.  work great on wood or tile. stay in place quite well.,1
1,Too tight - want to return them<br />Need return label mailed to me as<br />I am without a printer right now,0
5,girls loved them,1
4,Not fit right,1
4,I‚Äôve had 2 of these bands and also bought one for my husband. They are easy to put on and attractive but every one has had rough places that snag your clothing.,1
2,Runs super small,0
1,This broke within hours of putting it on.,0
3,TOO SMALL WAS NOT THE BIG POM POM THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS,0
5,"Love this dress. The material is very soft, and the length is perfect for me as well. Good quality, nice price.",1
1,"The material pattern is upside down.  It is quality material, but the horses and flowers are all upside down.  Would be a good rating otherwise.",0
3,"If you are large chested, this isn‚Äôt for you.  The pleated bust area, did not cover my chest.  The bottom of the pleats should be under the bust and were not.  It would be difficult to wear a bra with this dress.  The sides (arm pit area) of my bra showed.  I hate my bra showing.<br /><br />The color was nice.  I ordered the light blue color.  The material is soft, but kind of thin.<br /><br />I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh about 172 lbs.  I am a 36 DDD.  The dress basically fit as expected.  It was the correct size.  I ordered an XL.",0
3,The pants are nice/. However my husband had large calf muscles (he would die is he knew I said thatüòù).  And due to that- too small.  Very narrow at the bottom.  However- nice quality fabric.,0
5,I work 12hr nights have tried many support hose these are comfy and do not roll down!!!!,1
3,Some stones fell out.,0
2,"Meh...just like every other mask I‚Äôve gotten, too darn small. Seems well made and took the slow boat from China to get here, but can‚Äôt use it as I‚Äôm pulling it up my nose constantly as it rides down my face. Then when I pull it up it comes up my face. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure I traumatized a little girl at a rest stop while walking in, because it doesn‚Äôt really look like guy Fawkes when worn, just looks kinda scary.",0
5,"I love these shoes. Great fit, good price.",1
1,faded after 1 month.<br />bad quality,0
5,"Highly recommend, I just love it!!",1
1,Hat arrived after very long wait. The front was sewn on crooked so it looked like I had a sideways slant to my head! Returned this item.,0
1,So this is a nice looking watch but I have already had to work on the band to get it to close properly and I was disappointed when I discovered the bezel doesn‚Äôt rotate like description says. Glad I only paid $23. because it‚Äôs a $25 watch. Will update later when I have had time with this watch. Did not include microfiber cloth. Disappointed to say the least.,0
1,"Me gustan mucho,pero me lleg√≥ roto",0
2,Quality is not there.  Don't waste your money.,0
5,Just right for my grandchildren. Beautiful cross necklace.,1
5,From a distance looks really real looks way better then others i have seen,1
5,I read a few reviews & wasn‚Äôt sure but went for it & so glad I did my 8yr old nephew LOVED it. He walked around our Christmas party saying boogie bomb & was throwing it all over the place. So it was not only a hit but also durable!! & the price was great.,1
5,Love these...  They are so cute in my mouth.  I have my tounge pierced two times so they look great together!!,1
1,"Did not meet expectstions, but kept it. It is serving the purpose.",0
3,A bit of a struggle. But once you get it to turn and twist it fits in place. Comfortable. ..,0
5,"These are a great- very similar to the Soma vanishing edge panties but way better price!<br />When I first put them on I thought they might be a little too small but I ended up loving the secure feeling on my tummy. Not tight like spanx, which I hate, just a nice firm support.<br />The box they come in is super nice and will be used for a gift in the future.<br />Very happy!",1
5,"Purchased for my granddaughter, she loves it. Great value.",1
5,I bought this as a gift.  She will surely know it's a gag gift.  It looks incredibly cheap.,1
3,"I love orient watches. Some of them...... When orient does it right, they do it great!. But, when they do not, they dont. Anyways, this is a beautiful regular orient watch. The watch itself is very good quality. Beautiful dial. The case is very nice an built well. This watch has a plastic movement holder to be honest, but the watch is still great quality. Now, the BRACELET...... Complete trash!!!!!.... I am very disapointed an upset with orient on this one. The bracelet has hollow end links , plus the bracelet is trash. For 360 dollars they could have made such a better solid bracelet. I had a very hard time taking the bracelet off an while doing so scratched up my watch. I am very careful with my watches but this was a nightmare. The endlinks scratch in between the lugs an leave marks on  the bottom of the lugs. For 360 dollars this was disgusting. Orient makes great high quality watches.. buy this watch for the watch. But not for the bracelet... I had put on a beautiful goat leather blue strap. My future watch will be the orient star moon phrase. ""Hopefully""....... That will be the only watch i need in life.....",0
5,Fit perfect for swollen feet.  Wash and dry with no shrinkage.  Will order more.,1
1,Bought as a gift for a family member and battery was dead out of the box.  I can easily replace but I would have exected a working model<br /><br />UPDATE To above.  Bought a new battery to replace the dead one.  I am trained to replace watch betteries and have a complete set of watch  tools.  Took a damn jackhammer and 4 stcks of dynamite to get the back off and no amount of force/clamp/vice would get the back on again.  It's now just a paperweight in the shape of a watch.<br /><br />100% DO NOT recommend,0
4,Fit great,1
5, ,1
1,"I'm allergic to spandex.  It's very hard to find clothing with no spandex these days.  I bought these socks because they were described as being 100% cotton.  This is a lie.  When the package arrived, it shows the socks contain nylon in the toe and - you guessed it - the spandex I'm trying so hard to avoid.  The cotton part of the sock may be 100% cotton, but the sock is not.",0
5,"Perfect! I bought a large, I could of gone with a Medium. Lots of compliments!",1
5,Great fit and quality of sweat shirt.,1
2,Glass are ok but don't fit right.,0
5,"Very beautiful pattern and color. Can go with thin or thick clothing so does not matter what the weather is, very flexible. The included black mask is good, but my wife wore a more colorful mask and that worked out well too.",1
3,They don't stay in place on some glasses and they rip apart others... these aren't very useful to me,0
5,"Love the Yellowbox brand for flip flops (the only kind I will wear), and these are just as comfortable! Great purchase",1
2,"I am not thrilled about this item. It looks exactly what you would expect, but it looks a bit too silly. I think it would be great for little girls.",0
2,Great rings but the diamonds fall out easily .,0
5,"good quality, good fit",1
1,These were much smaller than I expected and are not real. They have since changed colors and look like rusted silver.,0
3,"These were slightly smaller than expected, but that worked for us. My biggest issue was that I ordered the army green and instead was given Navy blue. The grip on the bottom isn't the best. Overall though, these are good looking shoes that I expect to last a while.",0
5,really like these,1
5,"Women can wear this and size looks good, even on small wrist. Super cute and great value for occasional wear (same look of expensive bracelet will run you upwards of $200). Only wish gold tone was not as bright and branding stamped on anchor was not so large. Leather bracelet is perfect width. Also, this will stretch so don't worry if it feels a bit tight on initial wear.",1
1,"This is a beautiful necklace. However, I would've given it 5 stars but the second time I wore it, I noticed the extension part of the necklace was starting to fade and didn't really look into what had happened.  By the time I got home from an 8 hr work shift and took off my necklace and I noticed in the mirror there was a huge rust bluish grey metal stain behind my neck. I am really disappointed and a little angry that I had wore it for only 2 times and it had such a bad stain that even jewelry from Walmart is better quality.  Maybe that's why the price for this necklace wasn't too expensive...",0
3,It works as its supposed to just never received charger or instruction booklet for it.,0
1,They were not like the photo at all. Weird strips down the side seams. Not sure if theh got stuck in the machine during the dye process. Not a fan. Also too forever to get a refund.,0
1,"Nice cardigan or light over jacket. I think the price was too high for as thin as the material is. I found a navy blue one, nearly identical at Ross for a third of the cost. Same weight fabric. Felt like I got a kick in the pants, cause this one is stylish, but isn't worth the price. Starting to notice things are cheaper at the store than on Amazon. Might be a trend we are beginning to see.",0
5,"True to size, fits well.",1
5,They fit perfect and are super cute!! I like the different color options so that I can change them to match my outfit!,1
4,"I bought this to go with the strapless bra for my wedding, it is an exact match colour wise. I am 5'10 220 pounds, I have an apron from having two 9 pound babies eons ago. This panty gives absolutely no support and because of the cut it almost enhances the shape of my tummy (not in a good way). I'm sure you ladies know those panties that sit in that funny space under your navel and makes your tummy look very round, this is that for me. I will say that it is good quality and doesn't feel cheap at all and it's very sexy. Just not flattering, well not on me at least.",1
3,"I was looking for down coat with no fur, no stitches, not puffy, but to be warm to wear minimum layers of cloth underneath.<br />this one caught my eye immediately. and it  justified my hopes &lt;3<br /><br />only arms are somewhat small, I mean they feel a little bit tight on my arms with 1 thin sweater on. I am between M and L (171 cm / 68 Kg). but I guess I will not need any thick sweaters and cardigans under this coat as it really feels very warm.<br /><br />So, definitely, Yes to the Coat!<br /><br />UPDATE (on Jan 2015): I guess I'm going to regret this purchase, because the coat is too warm, i'd say hot, it does not ""breath"", it keeps all the warmth of the body and when i'm walking I start sweating (my other coats do not make me sweat). and it's not only me, my friend who purchased other orolay coat (Women's Thickened Down Jacket) experience the same issue. Really disappointed :(<br /><br />I gave it 5* when purchased, but now I think it's just 3*.",0
1,I bought these for swimming and they fell completely apart.  I didn't want my hand exposed to the sun.  They are made of<br />a sheer material and I am disappointed.,0
5,Beautiful and dainty heart bracelet. This is going to make the perfect Valentines gift for my niece. It's sparkly stones on the side add to the elegance of the bracelet.  The pink velvety case it comes in is so nice and makes it seem even more expensive than it is. I love this bracelet.,1
5,"Great service and product, very high quality!",1
2,"Not to rain on anyone's parade, but there's a big design problem with this otherwise pretty pendant/enhancer. I was able to buy it at a HUGE discount, and when it arrived, I noticed that the leather backing is glued to the metal. Since jewelry from this line tarnishes regularly (even in protected storage with anti-tarnish strips), especially mixed metal pieces, cleaning off the tarnish would pose a significant problem. There's really no way to clean the piece without damaging the leather. If it got damp/wet in any way, it would be ruined. Normally I love American West and Carolyn Pollack jewelry, but even at a low, low price, I felt I had to return this item.",0
1,Way too small,0
4,"If you're sporting excess Pandemic weight, not a flattering cut. I look frumpy in them and they're fine for house chores. Once I shed a few pounds, I expect I'll wear them in public. For Skinny Minnies - they'll be fabulous!",1
5,"The colors are exactly what you see and it‚Äôs a nice thick metal, very nice",1
5,Great not cheap looking.,1
5,"I am extremely pleased with this band. The color match is near perfect.  I love bling and this is very sparkly.  An overall classy bracelet watch. When opening the box the band was protected in thick plastic . The link removal tool kit was perfect and very easy to use.<br /><br />I wear my watch daily, so far no stones have fallen out.",1
5,"Love this bag. It hold my Ipad Mini (even with a small clamp on case for the back). Cute design and love the adjustable handle. Nice pockets for little extras. Also great for holding small items like cell phones, keys, lip stick/gloss, etc.",1
1,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 140lbs, this sweater was shaped like it was made for a cardboad box and was immediately itchy the moment I put it on, almost like a wool feeling. Requested a refund as soon as I put it on.",0
1,These are awful.  I wish I never bought. They don‚Äôt match and one has awful defects in it.  They aren‚Äôt as bright as the picture either. Don‚Äôt buy!,0
5,I'm 5'2&#34; 135 lbs I ordered medium and it's perfect.,1
2,Is ok for the price,0
1,"Poorly constructed, the lining inside the boot is a different size then the boot itself. Contacted the seller but the only advice I got was to return. The fabric in the boot is much different then the photo. There are only patches is sequins, a LOT less then you see on the photo. I‚Äôve bought boots like this on clearance for 10-25$ but $50 is WAY too much for something of this quantity. Really bummed out by the whole thing.",0
1,"I couldn't tell you how this fits because I never got it.  I emailed them 3 times with no luck of them getting back to me.  I don't have the hat, nor do I have my money back. Will not order from them again!",0
5,It's just what I expected<br />Easy to clean too.,1
2,"Cheaply made, had to remove the elbow patches made of cheap flimsy material and they were sewn in the wrong spot for the elbow!  I wear it around the house when it's chilly but wouldn't buy again.",0
2,The material was thin and the top much lower than depicted.,0
4,They are tights so how can you evaluate them precisely?  I'm satisfied but if I ordered again I would probably go up one size.,1
3,The material was too thin.,0
1,I did not like this shirt pattern; It was not pretty like the picture.  The sleeves are not to the elbow like the picture shows.  Very poorly made.  Foreign made so more trouble to mail back then it's worth.,0
5,Good fit nice color,1
3,My son like the shoes and I have the item on time,0
2,It looks amazing in the picture but it has an awful fit. Its pokey and uncomfortable. I was looking for a ‚Äòpretty‚Äô bra that will support bigger chests. This isnt it.,0
2,"I loved the length, design, everything. Below the chest was perfect but the chest and especially the arms were WAY too tight. I couldn‚Äôt even move around without feeling like I was going to rip a hole in it.",0
5,This is perfect!!  My 3.5yr old granddaughter picked it out to contribute it to her preschool class' dress up corner.,1
2,Elastic is too lose.  Doesn‚Äôt not stay putZ,0
5,Very warm and cozy.,1
5,"very basic watch that will last you, the straps last about a year till they start wearing out and breaking off. Then its on to the next one",1
1,"My son was really excited to have these light up sneakers however they are horrible. They look cheap, which I‚Äôm not shocked since the price was low. The lights only worked for a week! Don‚Äôt buy! Waste of money!!!",0
2,:(,0
1,Not as pictured.,0
2,The style was not as expected once I put it on. it seemed to fit awkwardly.,0
1,Returned...Doesn't look like picture. But great return policy. Customer service was awesome!,0
5,It's true to size. Do not size up for flowy  look it has not alot of shape so you are not doing yourself any favors.  I love them.,1
1,Garbage !!!!  Waste of your money and no help in returns !,0
1,The dress was attractive and appeared to be made ok for the money. Besides being way too small the bodice had too much stuff material and would never conform to your bust. And it was a big pain to send it back to China at my expense.,0
2,The fabric was heavy with  a prominent twill  texture.  Green color darker than photo. Returned.,0
2,"Really bummed that this broke in two months. My teenage son used the black skull one and he loved it. He is really careful with his stuff, and I don‚Äôt believe this was him being careless. It‚Äôs not aligned anymore, and since we need to keep his glasses safe he can‚Äôt use it. I wanted to get another but am worried it will break again.  This case has the best design for my son of any case I‚Äôve ever seen. ü•≤",0
2,Size is way off. I wear a size 12 tennis shoe so I bought the 1112. They were so large I gave them to my son which is a size 13. They are still large on him.,0
2,"Love the idea of this shirt.  Ordered up after reading the reviews, still much smaller than I was hoping for.  Shirt doesn‚Äôt seem as long as what is pictures.",0
5,"Very nice.  I'm a lady and ordered what Google said was my size in a mens shoe.  Love these.  Comfy,  looks good,  functional,  and not overly warm.  Would purchase again.",1
5,This came exactly as pictured and packaged really well. Super cute.,1
5,Wonderful polishing cloth for my jewelry!,1
5,Loved this!!,1
1,"The main reason I bought this is to protect my kid from UV.<br />She usually wears other brand but she tried this. After 2 days, she swam for 30 minutes each day with wearing this. She tanned a lot.",0
3,Much smaller than anticipated,0
4,"It's a very good quality product, and they are very pretty! I just wish the hook part would've been a little bigger to use on thicker tables.",1
5,Super cute and great length!,1
3,"These fit ok and the durability is ok. The toe area is a bit tight, but fit well other than that. The sole started to come loose after about 4-5 months, but doesn't seem to be getting much worse after over a year. Overall, they're not bad.",0
2,"Not very flattering for large chested women, lots of awkward side boob. Other than the top of the romper, everything else fits true to size and even has a bit of stretch.",0
5,"As a retired nurse, I am very used to wearing nitrile gloves and like to have a box around the house for cleaning and especially for picking up doggie poop.  These gloves fit well, nice and tight.  They are fairly easy to put on and take off, and stay on my hands well.  They do the job!",1
5,Very comfortable and stretchy  material,1
1,The hair piece was ok but the tail is not nice at all its bulky and I didn't use it at all. Think the product wasn't worth it and was cheesy,0
5,"I really like the style of this dress. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 124 pounds and measure 32-27-34. I ordered the boat neck dress with hibiscus floral print in a small. It fits beautifully.",1
5,"The socks are a nice fabric, not too itchy and I wish I could have worn them. Unfortunately they were too big and not compressive. Amazon was great in doing the return.",1
5,Very adjustable to fit nearly any wrist size and the ring is also adjustable. It is very pretty and soft on the skin.,1
5,I love this. I have a small frog collection and recent ally broke my prized blue frog that sat on mantle for years . This was a great replacement. It looks just like the picture.,1
1,Only one of the three lights worked.  They were a stocking stuffer for my son.  I was embarrassed  that only the one worked.  Should have paid more attention to the other reviews that had the same problem.. There is also no way to open the mini flashlights to replace the batteries even if I wanted to.  So I paid the price for 3 and only had one that worked.  I will update if the seller replaces this item.,0
5,Love it!!!  Very comfortable!,1
5,Nice...,1
5,I am satisfied with the chain I got,1
5,"really nice very light and breathing is no problem.  good looking also, well worth the purchase.",1
4,"Given as a gift, the blade was beautiful with great pattern to the steel. Only issue I had was that the button strap for the handle wasn't aligned properly to fit button while the blade was fully sheathed. I made a quick modification to the loops and was a perfect fit.",1
4,"These are very nice costume jewelry.  I am sure they are  not &#34;real&#34; turquoise but the size is good and I will wear them to work, etc. I think the $30 price is a bit high but not a horribly so given the construction of the earrings.  I found similar earrings at a local flea market and that vendor wanted $65/pr.  Yikes!",1
2,dress is beautiful but the under slip is sewn inside out and its very noticeable. I would like to get a refund even though Im a few days past the time of returns as I was on vacation while they were responding,0
4,"I bought these to use for our last party.  They were a lot of fun for us and our guests.<br /><br />I really wish the marker wasn't permanent.  They are reusable, but only if someone wants to use the same thing that someone wrote at the last party! I see now that the description says it's a permanent marker, but I don't recall seeing that before and thought that since you have to use the marker that came with it and they are reusable, that what was written could be removed. Lesson learned!",1
1,I didnt feel it fit me right. Idk how to exchage it,0
4,"Doesn't squeeze the ear, i wished they were larger though.",1
5,"I finally got to wear this hat in the rain and it performed wonderfully. I was concerned that the drawstring holes in the brim would allow rain to run down the drawstrings but it didn't seem to. Nice, wide brim kept me dry.",1
5,So beautiful- i'm giddy whoever returned it thought it had a flaw...perfect as far as I see it and it is unique and fab for everyday,1
1,Too tight,0
1,Out of the package the shirt has black marks as if it was run over. I would return but my child need‚Äôs tomorrow for school. Hoping I can get these stains out ! Unacceptable!,0
5,Just what I needed simple and easy to use.,1
2,"The hat is of fine quality, very well made, but be sure it is what you want before ordering. Returning it is expensive.  You have to pay mailing plus a restocking fee.  By the time you do this it becomes very expensive, Wouldn't do it again. Stick with Amazon things and not things from 3rd party people.",0
5,This necklace is perfect for any assassins creed fan . I am the envy of all my friends with this great necklace and couldn't be happier,1
5,"Bought this for my mom and she absolutely adores it! details, color and finish are perfect!",1
5,Gave 5 stars since the person I bought it for loves it!!,1
3,Cute jumper but was baggy in the crotch area which I thought looked funny. The rouching was uncomfortable but otherwise the fabric was soft enough. Great for a vacation outfit.,0
5,I am obsessed with this outfit first like a glove and it‚Äôs very sexy and comfortable,1
3,"The watch itself is very beautiful and elegant. Unfortunately, pretty much like the first review, the watch died in a week and needed a new battery, hence the less 2 stars. I do not know if this is an old inventory by the seller as this watch is now rarely sold, probably an old design.<br /><br />Had the battery replaced and wife still loved it.",0
2,I work in the back of a trailer reefer where the temp is set at -10.<br />These gloves are a waste of money and time. Finger tips froze so bad it hurt.,0
2,"Fits horrible, made for a person with with extended hips",0
3,"Fabric texture was weird for a dress that looked fancy online.<br />If you're short, this will look weird on you",0
5,A beautiful gift for my teenage daughter.  She loves it!,1
3,This dress just hung on me. It didn't feel comfortable at all,0
1,Returned,0
5,"very light weight, fits as expected, looks better than expected, nice to have when it's raining",1
1,I ordered these shorts on Amazon and also from a boutique.  The shorts from Amazon have come undone and the fray at the bottom is getting worse all the time.  The zipper section is also very odd and seems to poke out and feels cheap.  The pair from the boutique have held up nicely and does not have these issues.,0
3,It fit as expected but did not flatter my body.  I will be returning it.,0
1,Lettering fell off. Grandson was very disappointed.,0
1,Broke in 1 week.<br />Don not buy,0
1,Came in early but the actual charm didnt come just the choker,0
2,"I got the red shorts.  The cut is flattering to the ""package"" in front (when not wet!  dry suit only!) because the material is so light that anything ""pushing out forward"" is noticed - so that was a plus BUT once the material gets wet all bets are completely off.  The material is so light and ill suited for swimwear that, and I mean this literally, you can tell if someone is circumcised when these shorts get wet - twig and berries for all to see - not cool.<br /><br />And I also got the medium size but they fit like daisy dukes - I'm 5'8 with a 31"" waist and so I ordered the medium since I fall under medium - any sense of ""shorts"" here (that is to say, the sense that one is wearing shorts with material creating short legs) is almost gone when wearing these since they feel more appropriate for a gay club go go dancing in a cage rather than your local public swimming pool.<br /><br />Big disappointment.",0
1,Not as large as it appears in photo.,0
5,I bought this for a gift. And it is stunning!!,1
5,"Ring fits my middle finger perfectly, now I can truely express the dark side whenever I feel a need to raise it by itself, it came at the speed of light and stands ready to be drilled into the skulls of Jedi skum",1
3,"The shoulder straps were completely not placed right. They are off to the sides too much and cut into the skin. Kind of cheap quality too, but it's a cheap price so...",0
5,"Exactly what I was looking for- something small enough to have in my purse or pocket, and show my school pride.",1
5,"I love the roominess in this bag! Besides the fact that it has a very spacious main compartment, there are numerous pockets to use for smaller items. I use the two open pockets inside to hold my glasses case and my phone where they are easy to access. There is also a small zipper pocket inside, as well as two zipper pockets on the outside(front and back)...plenty of places to put smaller items. I carry a lot of personal &#34;stuff&#34; in my bag and still have room to put my tablet in there if I wish. Great bag if you are looking for space!",1
5,Beautiful,1
5,adorei,1
3,I like them but not a comfortable fit!,0
3,Not as fitted as I'd have liked.,0
2,"They fit alright but they are terribly, terribly thin.  Very good price but not a high quality sock.",0
1,Black one broke first try.,0
1,My silver bracelet is turned copper... Not happy,0
4,Beautiful but when I opened it was mess up some of the pieces came off I have to cut it but still look nice and the price is cheap. Please be more carefully when you pack it . Just because it was broken I'll give you 4 stars . Thanks !!,1
1,What a joke! I searched  sketchers by some ridiculousness this company is riding  on the coat tails of true comfort. I would have been better off burning  my money!  These things are junk! The right shoe is almost an inch smaller  than the left! Yes both labeled size 12!<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!,0
3,It's great for what it is. It's more like thin t-shirt material so it curls at the top,0
5,I loved it and so did everyone who saw me in this w my leprechaun outfit! Win!,1
1,"It‚Äôs cute, but I don‚Äôt like that it has a gap on the bottom where the seam is not sewn, small items like chapstick can fall out the bottom of the bag. The fabric also started peeling off the decorative leaf buckle after 3 uses.",0
5,Love it thank you,1
1,"To me, these were very heavy and the blue stone (glass) was too big and gaudy. Sending back.",0
3,Works well. Would have given it 5 stars if the Samsung headphone fit thru the hole or if it had some sort of adapter,0
2,"Ordered for wife. She wasn't to impressed, kinda poor quality and not as flexible as she thought it would be.",0
3,These are comfy however the spots around the frayed inlays literally frayed like fuzz. I'm sure alittle cutting would take care of all that. The leggens ARE super comfy.,0
5,Cool,1
4,Love it!!!,1
5,This watch looks awesome.  Great value!,1
3,Thinner than I thought. Looks a bit lopsided as well. It'll work though. Color is exact.,0
3,Cheap and was bent,0
3,"It was smaller than I execpted, but is perfect for a 4 year old to carry with dance shoes, and maybe a leotard!",0
5,"This a very product that I used, a lot.  The mistake was putting in the dryer. Yeah, I am that guy. Each one shrunk just enough to be to small. :(",1
3,pants faded to look like a faded navy blue after one wash,0
1,very loose fit,0
3,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON AND IT IS A  BIT SMALL AND EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET. KNOW YOU ARE PAYING FOR THE DIAMOND NAME BUT REALLY NOT WORTH THE COST IN THE LONG RUN.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.,0
5,I really like this watch. The light could be better but other than that it is perfect.,1
5,Hubby very happy with his new hat! Good quality and perfect colors,1
5,As expected,1
1,"These shoes are super cute, the color is great and I couldn't wait to wear them. The issues I am experiencing are with the size and sole of the shoe. The size is ok, but these run wide and are just getting wider with each time I wear them. The other issue is the footbed sole, it's basically rubber, so if you perspire at all, and or have damp feet forget about it. These shoes will have your feet slipping and sliding in no time. The material is definitely synthetic.",0
4,It's a strap. It works.,1
3,I always check reviews when making a purchase on line.  I am giving this bag three stars because I got what I expected for the price.  The color  is a bright coral not pink.  The pics posted in the review should have shown one more.  The tag inside that says content: polyurethane foam.  There is no tag that states anything about this bag being leather.  All leather bags will have a tag inside that says it contains leather.  So for the price the bag is well made  and could easily pass for leather.  Which is why I did give it three stars.  As for reviews --- Buyer beware!,0
1,"These are not at all what I was expecting. I don't know how anyone could fit these on their lip, they're really small. The beads are cheaply made, the jewels look awful and are basically glued on. Also, most of the beads won't stay on. They're constantly falling off and won't even screw on completely.",0
5,I love it it fits perfect. Cant wait to try it to make sure its not clingy like it says,1
1,Not magnetic -_-,0
4,"I like it, it's pretty and it's worth the price. I thought it was all one bracelet but even though it's not it's still a cute bracelet.",1
2,The jacket looks beautiful but had a faulty zipper from the start. Returned...,0
3,"they're all a little off center, but they weren't expensive so I guess you get what you pay for, other then that they're pretty.",0
1,"American flag products should be made in America. Vendors should be required to disclose the country of manufacture in their Amazon product ads. Note: ""designed in San Diego"" or ""assembled in Ohio"" does not mean Made in the USA either!",0
5,üòç,1
5,Amazing. I'm not a gal that likes regular. This was just perfect accessory for my fitbit flex 2,1
5,So Beautiful!!! My daughter really LOVE'S it!!! So do I!!! I might have to get me one!!! Love it!!! Thanks Amazon!üòäüòäüòäüåπüåπüåπ,1
1,Sorry I bought this. It needs two people to get it zipped. Waste of money. Have not bothered to wear it,0
3,"They are very comfortable BUT!!! SHED no matter how many washings and on clothes, carpet etc.",0
5,"Perfect fit, Fit TTS and are so soft!",1
2,Based on the pictures online I did not expect the color to be grey/olive. I ordered a medium and product fit looser than I expected. Will be returning.,0
5,Exactly how you pictured it,1
3,"Bought this since I've been seeing it everywhere. And this was a little shorter than what I thought. I am 5'4, 7 mos pregnant and have hips, thighs and a butt. It was cute but I did order one from shein that was a more preferred material that I liked and was a bit longer than this one. I'd recommend if you're comfortable with shorter dresses/skirts. Material wasnt bad just not something I like.",0
3,It‚Äôs a nice design and looks great. But the material this is made with is definitely not my favorite. It definitely ran on the smaller side as well.,0
3,"I love the way these look! They are gorgeous, but my nipples are to fat and won‚Äôt fit. üò≠",0
5,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 250Lbs I got the biggest size because I have big arms and didn‚Äôt want the shirt to fit weird but I loved the outfit on I was really surprised üíñ perfect for celebrating one of my best friends graduations,1
5,"Great product. These are good studs, different sayings and the metal is durable. Good present for a eccenrent person in your family.",1
5,Fits well and looks nice. Good quality and it was packaged with care. Had a little thank you card for health care works. I thought that was a nice personal touch. I appreciated it.,1
3,These are huge. Not what I expected but I can wear them with tall boots just fine. They do feel nice. Worth what I paid but no more.,0
2,I didn‚Äôt expect this to be super high quality but when it was delivered pieces were broken and the glasses wouldn‚Äôt open. The picture made it look way better than it did once received!,0
5,Fits perfectly. Lightweight. Size up if you want a looser fit. Lands higher on the waist.,1
5,"I had realistic expectations and I was so pleasantly surprised that the shirt fit perfectly and was of decent material, shape and is as cute as it looks in the picture. Very satisfied. :)",1
5,Love it.  Fits perfectly.,1
5,Any girl Who loves Minnie mouse would love these shirts. The colors are braids and will pair up with a lot of bottoms.,1
5,"I got this in dark blue and it‚Äôs my new favorite cap. The denim material is quality and the stitching is strong and even. The cap has an inner sweat band and is comfortable to wear.<br /><br />It comes in one size only. I usually wear a large in a hat, and I had to adjust the strap through the buckle on the back, as far as it would go. If you wear an XL, this won‚Äôt work for you.<br /><br />It‚Äôs comfortable on, looks good, and I prefer caps without slogans and logos.<br /><br />And the price of $18 is not bad.",1
5,"Love this, many compliments :)<br />The size numbers helped me find the correct size. I'm 5'2 @ 130lbs, a large (6-8) fits nicely<br />Good value",1
3,I LOVE this bracelet... My husband got it for me for Christmas.  I wore it on a weekend trip to San Antonio and at some point the clasp failed and it fell off and I lost it.  Boo... I'm so sad.,0
3,These we're not what I thought that they were they are comfy however when received I thought they were going to be a lot better made and look,0
2,Buttons weren‚Äôt lined up. I guess that‚Äôs what you get when you order cheap stuff from China....,0
3,Great package for the price! But very thin and cheap material.,0
3,It was really pretty but one of the pieces broke off within a few days.,0
4,Feels like its going to fall apart have to wear on necklace sizes wrong but otherwise a good deal for the money.,1
5,"Great fit, super comfy and soft. Perfect for lounging and watching GG",1
5,Nice color and fabric.  The fit runs a little small.  Good quality,1
3,The model shows the leggings coming up pretty high.  The leggings that I received the rise wasn't very high.  It hit me at a funny spot on my waist and caused muffin top.  So not attractive. I will stick to my yoga waist band.  They are a thick spandex material and are nice if you prefer a medium rise vs. high rise leggings.,0
1,"Funny color, not grey at all.  Won't use it.  Donating.",0
3,They are actually pantyhose made to look like socks. Very disappointed because I specifically wanted socks.,0
1,It came apart within the hour,0
5,Love love love this,1
1,Cheap . Broke before I could even put them in. Such a pity as they are very pretty,0
4,Beautiful dress by way too long. I am5'8&#34; and it was vey long. Otherwise it was vey pretty,1
4,Good quality fabric and the thicker straps are good. Not 5 stars because no matter what I do the straps are always twisted I‚Äôm guessing because of design and the straps won‚Äôt stay the length daughter wants. They just slide loose all the time. That can be frustrating. But the straps are great thickness and it‚Äôs heavy duty. Perfect for a kid.,1
3,"Even the XXL is Small , my waist is 38 and BEAWARE they are small and tight , would have liked as more looser fit.",0
5,I ordered this clutch to go with sandals I have and I love it‚ù§‚ù§,1
3,"Adorable. But, ordered 2 sets & within 2 hrs being outside in the sun, 4 out of 6 hats fell off the  headbands. Just a small dash of glue was seen. It was easily repairable but not that day. Hopefully they will hold up with my glue next year.",0
3,"Color, cut, and length was great. I would order this dress again but highly recommend ordering up a size.",0
2,pretty pattern but fit me like a maternity shirt and I'm a pretty curvy gal size 12 and size D bust,0
4,"Pretty awesome wallet. Wish the map of the game was brighter and more detailed but it looks great, made a huge fan of the title happy.",1
5,"Love this shirt, love that it has snaps and not buttons. Fast shipping. Fits great, got medium and I'm 5' 1&#34; 130 pounds.",1
1,"Washed it before wearing it and it tore apart!  Lots of threads came loose n bunches and lots of &#34;fuzz&#34; came off when dried.  It was not soft at all, kind of scratchy, even with fabric softener.  Poor quality, would not recommend.",0
1,very disappointed,0
5,Perfect for what I needed. Would recommend.,1
2,They didn't really look anything like the photo. the skit was way higher on me and didn't cover my butt like I wanted it too. I ordered a medium and I'm 5' 7'',0
5,"I was lusting after a new red purse and this bag is perfect.  Very well made, hardware is beautiful, and the color is gorgeous!!!  Can't beat the quality of this handbag for this price.",1
5,"These were great for the girls, they loved them",1
5,This was a gift for my son's OT and Speech teacher who came to our home . It is beautiful and she seemed to love it,1
5,Very pretty and light and easy!,1
3,The gloves were very comfortable and fit very good.<br /><br />My only complaint was I was riding in 22 degree weather the sun was shining and the wind was blowing about 4 miles per hour and my fingers were getting a little cold.<br /><br />Another layer of rubber or something else would have probably keep my fingers toasty.,0
1,"These face the same direction, so when you wear them they look lopsided..",0
1,Does not fit like picture,0
1,I ordered these pendants specifically for the surfer and baseball items.<br />Not one. A bunch of gymnastics and football. Something that I don't even know what it is...I had to send them back..,0
2,"I bought this as a gift for a 5-year old, and the bow is HUGE!!!  Thank goodness it is removeable!  Disappointed!",0
3,"Cute but it made me go cross-eyed every time I wore it. My eyes kept straining because of that. I'm sure it has something to do with the design of the lens, its very wide and angled in a weird way. I have another pair of glasses with the same prescription that doesn't give me the cross-eyed effect, so it has nothing to do with the prescription.",0
1,"Cheap material, looks like I made it in sewing class. Returned.",0
4,My daughter gets so many compliments!!!,1
4,"I am 5"" 5"" and 174 lbs. I ordered the XL and fit great everywhere except for the bust. I Am a 40 D.. super tight there.  Material is nice, collar is beautiful.. I",1
5,"Lovely and we'll made ready to wear dress. Top of sleeve has a little pleat. Embroidery is spot on with no defects. At 5'4 the length is just right, at about 2.5 - 3 inches above my knee. Perfect for work or date night! A nice &#34;go to&#34; little dress in black or any color! Love it!",1
1,To big,0
5,I'm very happy with my Black Tourmaline bracelet.  It's just like the picture and fits nicely.  Not snug.  I have big wrists and the stones fit well.  I feel a difference when I put this bracelet on and I'm typically a very sensitive empath to crystals and energy.  I'd say it totally works!  Good quality too!  Thank you Sublime Gifts!,1
4,The colors are good. Liked the adjustable ear loop and under chin flap. Fits great.,1
1,This is the 2nd pair I bought. Toddle 6 to 12 M,0
1,Trash,0
5,I truly adore this bracelet!! Originally when I ordered it the color of the wigs was like a pinkish red. In the middle of it being shipped it changed to the silver wings like in the picture and I love it way more than what it was originally suppose to be! The wings are flat so its not sitting up on your wrist. It came before the estimated delivery date and overall I love this bracelet and I am glad I purchased it!!,1
1,"The glasses weren't in the box with my other purchases. My app says they were delivered, I just never got them and my security guard says there were no other packages. üòïüòï",0
3,"This outfit is super cute, absolutely adorable but the material is not the best quality. The cotton is thin, the leg snaps are spaced too far apart, and the detail is printed on that iron on transfer type material, feels kind of like plastic, so baby gets hot quick. It's also a little on the large side, I ordered a 70 as suggested on the description for 0-6 months.I had to roll both the sleeves and legs for my 3.5 month old, 63 cm baby. I'd say it would only really fit a 70 cm, 6 month old, definitely not a newborn.",0
5,Not bad material and looks pretty good,1
3,"They came quick, and are as shown BUT packaging was so small. All 10 were shoved in a box smaller than my hand. They all came smashed and unusable. I soaked them in water for about a minute and let them air dry and they are perfect now. I bought them for party favors for a carnival themed party.",0
1,Bottoms were fine top to small,0
5,I love that the seamless have some compression and don't stretch out like the gymsharks do! I was on the fence and sure i wouldn't like these but they are awesome!,1
5,It's a perfect fit and after a month of washing and drying still looks new with no fading!,1
3,gets soiled easily..love the design maybe next time i will choose a different color. Great storage. convenient pockets,0
5,"I love the iridescent stone in this ring, the setting is elegant.",1
1,The shape was odd and nothing like the picture even when it was wrinkle free,0
5,"Wonderful colors, well made with all features needed.",1
1,Irregular on one side they fifnt see it properly,0
5,Lightweight and sturdy at the same time. Good fit and provides plenty of shade.,1
3,"Looks great, but fits a bit large from the belly area.",0
1,"NOT ONLY DID I NOT GET THE DRESS I ORDERED, which was the: ‚ÄúSequin Mesh Evening Party Clubwear Off Shoulder Strapless Tassel Fringe Bandage Bodycon Dress (In Silver),‚Äù the dress I got was torn and broken in MANY different places. Not to mention, the bag said it was ‚ÄúNEW,‚Äù yet the bag that the dress came in was old and used. The dress also came wrapped in was old/recycled Victoria‚Äôs Secret tissue paper. The tag of the dress was also not attached, but yet it was inside a little silver pouch that came with a patch of extra dress ‚Äúfabric‚Äù and a broken rhinestone chain and some bent hooks... Extremely disappointed and looking to return the dress immediately and get my money back.",0
5,"If you are looking for a newsboy hat this is one to consider.  It has everything that you would expect in a quality hat including high grade wool exterior, exact fit, and a very good inside liner.  I would highly recommend this hat to anyone that is looking for an affordable, high quality newsboy hat.",1
5,"Not only looks like a fine quality belt but it actually is.  I've ordered a few economically priced belts and this one is the best. Plus I was extremely impressed with how well it was packaged, everything covered to ensure no scuffs regardless of the roughness of the delivery itself.  Well done!!!",1
5,The mask looks and wears great. I personally think the Covid - 19 deal is extremely hyped up but here is SWF we have to wear one to even get groceries.,1
5,"I bought this leo for my daughter, it is very cute for gymnastics class. I recommend GK over other brands, they last a long time, pretty materials, done sag in the bottom area. Highly recommend! Shipping was fast, and intime!",1
1,I returned it.,0
5,I used this band to replace a cheaper one that was worn. The quality and appearance are excellent. I feel sure this band will last a long time. It also soft and comfortable,1
4,The purse was wider than I anticipated and it's stiff enough that it holds its shape. It's cute but bigger than I expected after measuring my old purse ' s dementions in comparison.,1
2,This is nice in person... fits well and holds my wife's tracker securely. Looks nice with her work outfits. But the plating on the metal pieces is very poor quality. Only 3 or 4 days of wearing it and the silver wore off the links and the copper is showing through. Two weeks in and it is turning her wrist black. She would have paid a few dollars more to have a quality finish like PVD or Stainless Steel.,0
1,The wrong size was sent! I‚Äôm discussed trying to get a band for this watch which I do love!!!,0
1,Not even worth $5,0
3,"Bought these for a costume party last year. They were ok, fit as expected. My little sister wore them later to a joan jett concert and she liked them. They are just a little stiff so you get blisters pretty quickly and the glitter wore off fast.",0
5,Love this bag! Bigger than expected. Came very quickly in guess packaging.,1
1,"This is a very breathable mask... admittedly doesn't protect you from much but does get you in the stores. Things started going down hill after washing it, which is when it fades and begins to get those little balls around the stitching. Also wish the branding was a bit smaller.",0
1,Complete misrepresentation of size.  I ordered a WOMEN's medium and it barely fits my very skinny 100 pound 18 year old.  So disappointed.,0
5,"I gave this to my roommate for Christmas this past year. She's always remarked how she wanted one, so this year, I made sure to get it for her. The original one she had on her wish list  was no longer available, but I saw this and she loves the color blue.<br /><br />It was a total hit! She loves it! It's got lots of pockets and a full zipper across the top, plus a handle that's long enough she can put it across her body! I kinda want one for me, now!",1
3,My girls love the way it design.,0
4,"love the glasses, lost a stone already but oh well!",1
1,"Looks very nice and appears to be well made, no machining burs or unfinished surfaces. Feels nice and smooth and looks great on the watch and wrist. The finish matches the matte sides of the watch case perfectly, even the polished surfaces of the watch case looks good with the bracelet. Once I figured how to attach bracelet, it literally took less than 1 minute to fully attach to my 45mm Galaxy Watch 3.<br /><br />The only issue I have is the fit of the links against the watch case. One side fits great and is symmetrical against the watch case. The other side of the bracelet attaches lower on one end which creates a slope. When you look down at the watch, that slope creates a noticeable gap between the case and the bracelet. I look to see if there was some sort of adjustment I could make, I did not see any.<br /><br />This is a nice band, a little heavier than the VMORO brand but I don't mind the extra weight. Unfortunately It does not fit on the 45mm Galaxy Watch 3 case as advertised. There is a noticeable an uneven gap between the watch case and the metal band. Therefore I will be returning this item and rating it low because it does not fit as advertised.",0
4,It was very comfortable and super cute! Definately would recommend.,1
2,It says dialy instead of diary . I mean come on .,0
5,They fit nice and look cute.,1
1,Too big.,0
5,Nice shirt. I wear it a lot to work. Comfortable fit.,1
1,I bought these once when Amazon stopped carrying Braza On the Edge shoulder pads. Waste of money. Lost one on the street within the first hour. They Velcro onto bra straps in an awkward position and are not flattering. Bring back Braza On the Edge. They look more natural and stick on the shoulder.,0
1,Does not fit at all for the glasses that it says it does,0
5,Great item! Worked perfectly for our event. Looked totally stylish & cute!,1
5,"YES...You will love this Apple Watch Band!  Excellent quality with this Band.  The white color band segments augment and soften the stainless steel look.  This band was purchased for a Female, and it really makes the Apple watch look better.  Received many compliments on the Band.  If you are looking to class-up your Apple Watch for an evening out or for a special event, this is perfect. Very easy to put on the wrist and remove.  Easy to remove links with tool provided.",1
5,"Got here fast and true to size. Colors are spot on. For the price, you can't beat it.",1
1,Would suggest not buying this product.  Very poorly made and broke in the first two days,0
5,I believe this is a repeat order and am as happy with this transaction as the first!!!! Highly recommend.,1
3,"The item looked good, but it was infant-sized.",0
5,"perfect size, best quality!",1
4,"Nice, good quality but the line on the purple part is not as visable on the product shipped so not quite as fancy as what is pictured",1
5,everyone who has seen me wearing this shirt have been very complimentry,1
5,I love how they have Tie Bars for different temples now.  I hope they make more. I love mine.,1
2,I think the undergarments are absolutely adorable! However the size of the product is way off. The shirt did not even fit over my head! I should have known better when I saw one size. But I tried anyway. I would only buy this for a 14/16 or maybe 1/2. Would not buy the item for anyone any bigger.....,0
3,Looks great! It fits my son's hand perfectly. The only problem is that the stones popped off after about 15 minutes. Not a really big deal as I just took some Gorilla glue to them and put them back in place. Looks fantastic in the light and even better in the dark! Please know This is shipping out of China and will take a while to get here!,0
2,"I have a lot of padded shorts, just purchased in the past few weeks.  I'm riding daily and needed lots of spares for laundry.  This pair is super thin padding - to the point that it's almost like not wearing padding.  Skip.",0
3,"Ok tee, not great. Itchy tag but easily removed. Fit as expected.",0
5,Wonderful belt that fits. Nice quality and finish.,1
2,Very poor quality stone.  The Jasper is so<br />Pale with no detail at all which makes picture jasper a pretty stone.  The petroglyph mounting is beautiful & deserves a better quality stone.  I am returning the ring..<br /><br />Several weeks ago I also ordered this same petroglyph ring with Howlite and it too was a poor quality stone.  No veining and looks like a poor grade mother of pearl stone.  I probably should have returned this ring too but I kept it. Again that beautiful mounting deserves better stones.  Please try Sleeping Beauty Turquoise,0
1,"Looked pretty at first, shortly after it started to change color to an old &#34;gold&#34; color (was rose gold). Then, the teardrop fell off the bottom of the necklace and wouldn't reattach. Overall poorly made.",0
2,I got the Medium for my 10-year-old son who is relatively small for his age. The fit is as expected and that's about the only thing right about this.<br /><br />The fabric is 100% polyester and it feels plasticky.<br /><br />Sewing/stitching work is horrendous. Tapering around each leg is inconsistent poorly executed as I tried to capture in my photos.<br /><br />I would stay away from it,0
5,Love how long they are great material for my long natural hair and box braids,1
5,"Excellent product.  This is my second order and will probably buy more.  Well made, great material, washes well and is extremely comfortable.  All in all this product is a bargain.  Thanks!",1
4,Fabric kind sheer. Must be worn with a slip or pettiecoat. I shorten the dress and it's perfect!  Polyester blend makes it an easy iron dress for your work week. Fits true to size. May want to purchase a 2&#34; wide white patent leather belt to go with it to accent your small waist.,1
4,"Nicely made, I like the button trim. Looks like they will stay up, but won't be road tested until the weather turns.",1
5,Love this watch band! It makes my apple watch look nicer than with the silicone bands and is super comfortable.,1
4,Cute earrings for the price but expected less tiny looking gold tone,1
5,Got my lasik done a few months ago and was shopping for some polarized sunglasses.  Great deals on these sunglasses.  I'd recommend to my family and friends.,1
3,"I bought it, and i'm happy I did, the color is closer to a dark sea foam green than teal, but it's still pretty.<br /><br />The chiffon part is perfect, but the slip underneath leaves alot to be desired. The quality of the dress is alright, but the main problem is the length of the slip under the dress. I'm a curvy girl (40-34-39) 5', 170lb.  I knew it was going to be shorter (and that's fine, I have another dress where the slip is shorter than the chiffon), but this shift barely covers my butt. And it consistently rides up, causing me to constantly be pulling it down, lest my bottom be shown to the world. Which as someone who is 5' tall, I have never had a problem with.  Additionally, while the dress is stated to be 44&#34; circumference, that is only for the chiffon, which is not clarified. The shift underneath fits me like a bodycon dress, exacerbating the issues. Again, I have a similar dress where the slip is shorter than the dress, but it's also loose like the dress and longer, negating the issues. In the end I ended up putting a waist trainer over the slip which helped a little. But I shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />tldr - don't buy if you're curvy and if you are, try putting a waist trainer over the slip to keep it from riding up too much.",0
5,"I'm pretty obsessed with sticky bras at the moment. I want comfort but also need support. These do just that for me. They have just the right amount of support, fit well, and are great under strapless or spaghetti strap tops or dresses. I also love that they are reusable. Definitely be sure to apply to clean skin with no lotions or oils.",1
4,Super cute but I unfortunately can‚Äôt wear it because it made my skin react really badly.,1
5,Its beautiful!,1
5,Nice quality,1
3,"Easy to attach and detach from my Samsung galaxy watch and really easy to adjust length. However, I  got a rash after wearing. Tried only wearing i during the day while working but rash ontonied to get worse.",0
5,My daughter loved the crown and sash. It was a perfect fit!,1
1,Nothing about this bag is good. Flimsy fake thin material. Doesn't hold its shape at all. Paper think leather type material. I feel cheap even trying to use it. Returning item. Never purchasing from them again.,0
1,"Beautiful color that promises a lot. Unfortunately, it was too flimsy. Tight at the top and loose at the waist.",0
5,Excellent DY starburst knock off earrings.  Surprised it is so accurately ‚Äúdesigned inspired.‚Äù  Looks lovely and wish they made the ring and necklace of the same.,1
5,Very high quality. I‚Äôve spent way more money on name brands and these are much better fit and quality materiel if you are looking. I bought another pair in diff color I was so pleased,1
2,"I previously wrote a review based just off first impression, which was perfect.  This dress is lovely and my daughter is obsessed with it, looks just like the picture.  But the yoke started separating from the skirt before she finished the first wear and the smocking is coming undone after a single wash.  Very cute but poor quality.",0
3,"I'm pretty sure they're cool headphones/beanie. I never got mine which is a bummer. My next door neighbor ripped everything up to the box it came in for some reason, but I'll be ordering another later on in the future.",0
5,"I received sooo many compliments on this band! It was too big but thankfully it came with the tool to remove links. No complaints, GREAT BUY! I will def purchase other colors =)",1
5,Great price for costume. It was the right size for a tall youth.,1
1,Did not receive the dress pictured,0
1,"Really light and comfortable, super cute, but I live somewhere humid and it made the color run and stained my feet<br />Edit: these sandals only lasted 5 weeks before they broke, I wore them a total of about 20 times :(",0
5,Super hot... I love dark shades,1
5,Beeautiful dress. I love it! I am 5 ft 4 and 154 pounds and I got a large. It looks great on and quality material. a semi-thick frabric.,1
5,"I am very pleased with this pair of readers! The case alone is worth the price...They are a little more subtle in colortone than I expected with most of the splotchy detailing being evident on the arm pieces rather than on the front of the frame. However, there is just enough so that they do not look solid brown but have almost a dark plum undertone.I am pleased with the quality overall and happy to add them to my collection of readers!",1
3,The pocket has already come undone from the seam. It's gotten a lot of lint balls too. My son loves it but it didn't last very long.,0
1,"Absolutely horrible material, as soon as I pulled it out of the package I knew I would never wear it in a million years...but you get what you pay for, so I will probably eventually cut it up and use it for some sort of cleaning cloths.",0
1,Terrible! This ring looks like it came from a penny machine. Looks nothing like the picture. No shine at all. It's a shame that sellers can get away with such false advertising!,0
5,"I love this dress!! So soft and comfortable, yet also dressy. Love the flattering fit. A little long, but fabric will be easy to hem. I'm 147 lb. and 5'3&#34; and ordered a medium.",1
3,"This purse is only Okay.  It looks and feels cheap, which makes sense for the price I paid.  I'm going to return it.",0
5,Just like the picture. Not cheap or any funny business. Just some solid charms.,1
5,I have given several Lady Color gifts .  They are nicely packaged and really sparkle.  Highly recommend - great quality for the price.,1
2,"Order a size up and also know that it is a serious catch all! (Lint, hair and everything)",0
2,Had to return it fits small,0
5,"LOVE these glasses! We wore these for the 4th, but my daughter is going to wear them in a country photo shoot! They are extremely high quality! I was not expecting these to be REAL quality due to the price, but they definitely feel like an $80 pair of shades!",1
1,the sent me wrong color and its to short,0
4,"Bought this ring for my son's Christmas gift. It was just thrown in the box, nothing to stop it from shaking. Small scuff mark on one side but not enought that he would tell. Very heavy and feels well build.",1
1,"Not what I expected, material is weird and really long. Not worth the money :(",0
5,Made well! Fabric and glitter and bow are just so cute and fit adults just fine.  Great deal!!!!,1
3,"I liked the colors, but not the fit. I prefer more loose-fitting clothes that don't show every bulge. I returned them.",0
2,"The jersey was well made, but the sizing was completely off. (WAY too big.)  I received the item close to a month after I ordered it, and attempted to return it a day after I received it, only to be told that it was outside of the return window!  I then had to file a claim with Amazon.  Buyer beware!",0
5,This product has great quality! I bought them for my husband and his groomsmen as gifts and 2 years later they are still going strong! They even held up to me hot stamping initials into them!,1
3,"This slipper fits a mens size 8/9, way too large for my feet. They are pretty warm but no memory foam as advertised.",0
3,This rings did not last. They were used by my husband and they did not last long. They broke loose to soon.,0
4,Loveeeeeeee these!!!! My husband is very pleased and bought me another pair in black. Only downfall is they run a good half size small but i normally wear a 9 and ordered a 9 but it's doable without looking crazy.,1
1,can't get them on.,0
3,"Too short and too thin! Not spandex material and more of a shiny white, material resembles sheer curtains. ü•¥",0
3,"The fabric is nice and light, the colors beautiful , but the sizing runs VERY small.I ordered 2 in different colors and both had to be returned. I was sad as I really liked them.",0
1,"The product took a month to arrive. Aside from it being malformed and delivered in a box that was rode hard and put up wet from overseas, it is made from a cheap high density foam that barely retains its structure. This was not worth the time to delivery or the money. I would select zero stars, but Amazon makes you start with 1.",0
1,The quality is poor and you have to put it together on your own. Save yourself money and use your child‚Äôs favorite hat and go to a hobby store to buy heavy duty plastic and Velcro and make it your self.,0
1,Way too<br />Large,0
5,My 7 year old daughter was Addison for halloween & I ordered several Addison cheerleader costumes so we could select the best one!  This one hit the mark & was reasonably priced.  It was cute & comfortable & with her blonde wig looked just like the little zombie Addison cheerleader!,1
3,these look to be warm and the pointer finger on the right hand has a patch that can be used for a cell phone  but the fit is snug - a bit concerned that if I wash them they may shrink -,0
2,"I actually like these bras, however, the bra that arrived was about 4 sizes off from what I ordered.  I compared it to bras I have on hand just to be sure.  The difference was huge. I am afraid to order another one. I don't know if it was simply mislabeled or if they run that small.  I am a 36B.  My granddaughter is a 32B.  It is tight on my granddaughter.  Do they run small?",0
4,"Beautiful earrings. Long enough for me to thread through both my holes, looks really pretty. Silver is not super shiny, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure if it‚Äôs sterling. But they‚Äôre lovely anyway so I‚Äôm keeping them.",1
5,"Nice glasses were just to big for my glasses and face, so did return",1
5,Really cute and really great material,1
5,Purchased for my grand daughter. Love the quality fabric,1
3,Need more card slots,0
1,"I was not happy with this purchase due to the fact that both times I ordered it,  it was the wrong item. Even though the package said it was an elephant, both times with the original order as well as with the reorder, it was a dog!!",0
3,I bought these and based on some reviews that they run small I ordered size 40 (I'm a 38). They arrived and I tried them on but they were too big on me. It looked like I was wearing a long skirt. I returned them and got a refund.,0
5,"My one (small) complaint is that the neck of the shirt is smaller than shown on the model. You can't drape it off your shoulder. BUT I am so in love with this top! It is very sheer - as beach cover ups usually are.  It will be super cute with a bright neon suit underneath, but for now I am wearing it with a cami underneath and jeans. I am a L-XL, and it is still very loose fitting and flowy, so beware if you are a tiny girl! It is also a bit longer than the photo on me, almost to my knees - but I am only 5'2&#34;",1
4,Just as described,1
1,Didn't work upon receiving it so we returned it.,0
2,Description says 100 pieces,0
1,"Possibly one of the ugliest shirts I've ever owned.  The fabric is longer at the hip and shorter at the center - which is shown - however, the visual is that your butt is HUGE.  Really dislike this shirt.",0
5,"So glad I got the biggest size with my broad shoulders. Otherwise, I loved it.<br />I washed it on regular with dark clothing. Then let it air dry on a hanger to keep it's form. It turned out great!",1
2,"the plug is not easily inserted with peace in the shoes , so hard to plug it",0
5,"My daughter loves them, need to buy her more.",1
5,Does the job . Nothing speacial .,1
3,Nice belt but way too tight for a medium.,0
5,Very good quality product. Quick delivery.,1
1,I only received 2 glasses in stead of thre,0
5,Absolutely love these!!!,1
3,didn't fit as expected.,0
5,"After wearing 4 days straight, night and day, I have not had any allergic reaction to the necklace.  I am very pleased so far.",1
2,they look good but are not any more waterproof than any other tennis shoe. As soon as I stepped in wet snow socks were soaked.,0
2,"Thin, above ankle fit.<br />Tagged as Sleepwear",0
2,"The bows came off after a couple wears. They're still super sparkley, and my daughter loves them, but it's a big bummer the bows all came off.",0
4,Muy bien excelente y bonito vestido,1
3,these are super soft and comfy but the sizes run large even if you measure your chest and torso to the chart... get a smaller size than you measure. mine are very loose im hoping they shrink in the wash.,0
3,"Nice bracelet,  the little ball came off",0
5,I like everything about it!,1
1,"Advertised Color is Burgandy, received Rust color. A big let down.<br />Can‚Äôt trust Chinese products and sellers.",0
5,"I first found these amazing pants at tjmaxx. I haven't found them at the store since, but boy am I glad I found them on Amazon! I bought a few more to add to my collection and these are the only workout pants I will use, I've purged my other less worthy pants.<br /><br />These are so incredibly comfortable, they fit perfectly, look amazing on, hold up in the wash, and have a secret pocket so I can stick my phone in while working out!<br /><br />Their customer service is also amazing, which makes the pants even better :)",1
3,Nice material and I love the pockets,0
3,Stitching sometimes off the edge of the leather. In other areas way too much leather meant centimeter area sticking away from stitch. I love the ability to attach to belt clips instead of strap. That‚Äôs better over the Vagabond. Otherwise Vagabond for a little more money is much better quality and higher grade leather.,0
2,"Checked reviews. Not one from confirmed buyer.<br />But watch looks cool, so 2 stars instead of just one.",0
3,"I was hoping that since this item is listed as ‚Äúone-size‚Äù it‚Äôd be longer, but it reaches just above my butt so I can‚Äôt wear it as a dress on it‚Äôs own. It‚Äôs really cute and high quality like the pictures, but I am disappointed at the length.<br /><br />For reference: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and have an hourglass body type. If you‚Äôre plus-sized and/or taller than 5‚Äô5 or so it might be too short.",0
5,"I bought it for my friend she really likes it, the quality looks good",1
4,Love this dress shape and fabric,1
5,The material is thick and soft. It will be a great fall/winter shirt.,1
2,"Purchased this belt for my husband around Christmas time. This weekend it broke! Meaning it only last about four months... so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for your go-to, everyday, belt. The tongue piece that goes through the hole snapped off! Very disappointed.",0
5,This is a good light to medium weight hoodie. It‚Äôs soft and very comfortable. Fit as expected and the color is an exact match to the photo.,1
2,Not thick at all. Hard to get apart and I'm impatient,0
4,"At first, I wasn't a big fan but ended up loving these. They are sturdy and made with great material. They are easy to use and easy to wash. These are affordable and come in handy.",1
2,"The shirt itself was fine. Fits a bit small, so go the next size up. Just a long sleeve tee with quality reflective vinyl. But the pocket...WOW! The pocket starts about the bottom of where a normal pocket would. I put a pen in there and had bruises underneath my man boobs.",0
5,They‚Äôre great but order 2 sizes larger.,1
5,These are great for helping older kids keep their face masks from touching other surfaces when they need to be taken off. The 12 pack is convenient to keep them around the house and in the car.,1
1,"Does not fit properly, cheap, thin material",0
4,My daughter says they are confy but looks a little bit cheaper,1
3,I like the dress<br />The chest is so big that I cant wear it,0
2,Very narrow for average foot size even after going up a full size.,0
5,Got it as a gift for my gf through Amazon Lightning Deal. She loves it :) Great quality and great price!,1
5,Great mask. Got it for my son to go to a school dance. Looked great!,1
5,"These booties are perfect!! I usually wear 6.5-7 in most shoes, and have small ankles. I usually don‚Äôt like booties because they have wide gaps around my ankle. These fit perfectly, are really comfortable, and fit close to my ankle. They are prefect for skinny jeans and dresses. My new favorite pair of shoes!!",1
5,"Fit perfectly, and look great and very unique.  There were over 80 tballer's at tryouts and he was the only one with these cleats, very happy with them",1
1,"This is not cotton, but some sort of polyester.  The logo looks nothing like the picture and you can see burn marks around it where it was &#34;ironed?&#34; on.  Terrible product.  DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />I've bought dozens and dozens of products from Amazon.  This is the first one I've ever had a problem with.",0
5,all the buttons work very smooth and nice. eazy to set time/alarm. very slim and light. I would buy it again.,1
5,Just what I expected!,1
5,very comfortable and beautifully made!!!,1
2,Did not like because the sil material was too hard to tie and slipped off too easily,0
4,Great for layering,1
5,Great price and delivered as expected.,1
1,"I read the reviews that said it ran small. I wear a small,  so I  ordered a large. That being  said,  this is a large for maybe a little kid.  It would not fit my 11 year old.  Beware!",0
5,Only Wish these were cotton...<br />Other than that there great!!...,1
4,"En mi caso el frame es un poco mas grande a pesar que verifique las dimensiones antes de comprar, lo instale solo con las chapas laterales",1
5,Feels durable and doesn't look cheap. Leather looks nice so I chose this over the all silver one with 2 rings. I like it!!!,1
1,Pants see-through<br />And trough material,0
1,Everything that other reviews have said about these being horrible quality..... believe it. Sending these back,0
1,To small for 3xl,0
5,My husband loves this hat,1
1,These are gray lenses with orange paint!  Like looking through a Kaliedescope.  All sparkly on the edges.<br />Of all the choices I pick these rip-offs!  If you must have them go to the gas station and pay 5 bucks.<br />My last words...DON'T !!!!,0
1,"I don't know what they covered these frames with, but they leave black all over your face! Every pair I tried left black all on my one and face!",0
3,This shirt is way too short and apparently not eligible for return,0
1,Unfortunately this product has no support and the fit is very awkward. It was also hard to put on. I would like a refund or am someone from the company to contact me.,0
2,Very uncomfortable.  Seams in armpit region rub quite unpleasantly.,0
3,"What I wanted, does fine for bright day in car.  NO POUCH as advertised unless it's the clear baggie it comes in!!!",0
2,"This is my first day wearing these socks, and they keep coming off my feet. I even sit most of the day at work, but they don't want to stay on and are even more annoying when I do walk. I can't return them either even though I received them yesterday.",0
2,Cheap....i could have gotton better quality glasses st the dollar store!,0
3,"For my daughter dance. She‚Äôs 9. As soon as we opened them we noticed a lil hole on the leg part. Didn‚Äôt bother cuz it wasn‚Äôt noticeable But as soon she tried them on half way, we notice the holes in the middle.",0
1,The shirt is exactly what I wanted I am a size medium but got  a large which fits like a XS . I would purchase it gain though,0
2,not really a good buy at all,0
2,"Loved shirt's message, color, and softness but it was several sizes too small.",0
3,Pants ripped in the crotch after one wear. Super cute outfit though.,0
3,"As other reviewers have said, buy at least two sizes larger than your normal fit. I usually wear Victoria's Secret size medium, so I ordered the X-Large in these (despite how it made me wince and feel dysmorphic and self-hating to do so), and it's still uncomfortably tight sometimes, particularly if water retention is a factor. Still a good deal for the price.",0
4,they slip on and are a comfort for my legs.,1
5,i love every thing about QUAY glasses. style the weight the tint.also love the mirror one's,1
5,Cute and Fun design and fit great !,1
4,Kind of thin but otherwise nice,1
3,"The yellow visor is really &#34;goldenrod&#34;, and I don't know about the fit because I didn't open it... It was a forced choice question.",0
1,"I do not at all like these shorts!!!! They are not at all what they are advertise. They're about 3 sizes off the size that you order. They are very thick, hot, and too heavy! I want to get my money back!!!!!!",0
5,"I have a number of pairs of sunglasses, but I especially like these.  I have the black frame with grey lenses and red trim lines.<br /><br />1.  They are classy looking, with the red trim lines on the stems.<br /><br />2.  The shape of the glasses is very good.  The lenses give protection from sun coming from the sides, the stems fit tightly to sides of my head, and the bridge is better designed than most sunglasses.<br /><br />3.  They are comfortable to wear for an extended period.<br /><br />4.  Vision through the lenses is clear without distortion",1
5,Good,1
5,Really loved the fabric. Looks and feels very expensive,1
5,"I bought 3 pairs of goggles of different brands to use in a salt water pool.  These were the least expensive of the 3 but actually performed the best.  These are comfortable, do not fog, have great suction, clear view and have no magnification.  It looks like they are not orderable anymore which is a shame because these were quite good.",1
4,A quality product but too small in the calves.  Warm and comfortable otherwise.,1
5,"Excellent fit, great quality",1
1,Very large and heavy not what I expected,0
5,"...had to buy another one (in pink). Feels good on, fits and washes well. Very please with my Pink Lady purchases from Majdell Group.",1
5,Fast delivery!,1
2,"The packaging of this robe was a disappointment. The robe was stuffed into a box with no wrapping.  I expected that it would be, at least, in a plastic bag before it was placed in a box.  The robe is ok, but the belt greatly disappointed me. There were several stray threads on it and it was not properly sewn at the ends..  Also, the belt is clearly in two pieces sewn together as seen in the picture.  I feel this is poor workmanship and cheapens the look of the robe.  Had I known the belt would look like this I would NOT have purchased the robe.  I am wondering how long the belt will last.<br /><br />It is not worth my time and effort to repackage the robe and return it.  I am very disappointed.",0
5,I'm 5'2 and 106lbs so I bought the small and I'm totally fine with it hitting right at my knees and not mid thigh like seen in the advertising photos. It is warm and soft. It arrived covered in little loose pieces of the robes fluff so definitely must wash first to get rid of them. No more comes off afterward. I washed on cold gentle cycle and dried with low heat. No shrinkage. My husband likes the home colder while I prefer the heat so I figured I'd just wear something warmer around the house but I wanted to still look nice since a lot of the other robes are just so bland looking and this fits what I wanted! Lounging at home in cute style!,1
5,"Wanted an inexpensive spin shoe, these do the trick. I'm a size 8 and got the 39, they fit fine.",1
5,Material is great! Thick and stretchy<br />I purchased the shoes as well . So far so good we are satisfied with the purchase . For fit information my daughter wears a size 6T and Size small fit perfect.,1
3,Color was not exactly the right shade of purple but it was nice,0
4,These are perfect for me and my girlfriend since we both like Pokemon a lot.,1
3,"The picture puts you under the influence that you review hearts for every size, you don‚Äôt. Other than that, I‚Äôm enjoying my kit. They organized everything by sizes for you. WHICH I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR!!!",0
4,I'm addicted to alpaca socks and these are just so cute.. I wish they were a bit softer and fuller like my warrior striped socks and wish it stretched over my thigh higher.. It stretches nicely though. And wore sooo nicely at festivals with my combat boots.,1
5,Great price!,1
2,"IT'S JUST O.K., TOP IS O.K. BUT BOTTOMS NOT WORTH IT.",0
1,This is he most poorly designed laptop case. I got this for my 12 year old to stick his chromebook in at school and side pockets for pens and mouse is big. BUTTTTT the straps to carry bag are sewn imto the side slots. Which meqns you cannpt zip the side pockets if you want to carry your bag! Pretty stupid if u ask me.,0
3,I really liked the way they looked. I lost one in the shower and thought I just didn't tighten it enough. I woke up without a second one a few days later and this is after tightening at least twice throughout the day. Unfortunately they were too good to be true.,0
3,Ok dress socks. The solid designs are fine. The patterned socks are super small and have no stretch to them that I can't even get them on my foot. My 12 year old tried putting the patterned socks as well and they don't fit her they have to be child size sock.,0
3,"boots are not really good. Sole is too stiff, leather is also too stiff. Wearing them is not comfortable for feet.<br />i preferred to return them.",0
1,it's adorable but it's too small for an adult ear,0
5,Beautiful sweater and fits great,1
1,Ordered my right size. Had to send back to small.,0
5,Good looking product! Fades in water though.,1
5,Very cute!!  Great price!!  Get lots of compliments üòâ,1
5,"I mean seriously, comfy, cute and pockets is like finding a unicorn.",1
3,"Great color (gray) fits well, a lot warmer then I thought it would be. Would give it a 5 but the zipper is pretty cheap, difficult to get it zipped up...hopping it doesn‚Äôt break",0
1,"The bottoms are way too big, and top way too small.",0
3,M√°s grande de lo normal,0
3,I like UnderArmor but don't much care for these shoes. Sorry I bought them They tend to ride outward at the heel and I fight to keep my foot in the center of the shoe. Most uncomfortable as well. Reason for the 3 star is that it could be possible that it is my feet. Otherwise I assign a 1 or 2 star. Surprised at UA.,0
5,colors are very pretty,1
1,Made from very thin materials and stains very easily. DOES NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. Got soaked through to my underwear in medium strength rain fall,0
1,Will return. Not what was expected.,0
4,"Small and dainty and lovely, but the wolf wasn‚Äôt as detailed like the picture and a little more rounded cut out and not as precise, but I can still tell it‚Äôs a wolf :) lovely chain and clasp and gold color.",1
5,Fits great,1

3,Looks exactly like the pic but really not impressed... pricey and wasn‚Äôt packaged nicely.  Was squished in a plastic bag.,0
5,"Its a cute simple tote bag. Not really huge like a lot of tote style purses tend to be. I like it! Its big enough for everything i need and i can even fit my ipad inside. Really thinking about getting myself the black one as well since i like the tan one. Ive had it about a week and a half.. so far everything is holding up. The straps do feel a little like cheap vinyl faux leather stuff, so how long they hold up will be the question?",1
5,Bought these for my daughter's birthday party. They came fast and were very cute,1
5,Adorable and so well-made.,1
3,"Sweater is great. However, the stitch on the pockets were poorly done. One of the pockets stitch opened up after one wear. Otherwise, I would‚Äôve given a higher rating.",0
2,I'm not so happy to this product because it faded so fast for only one time use. I kind of regret buying this.,0
5,Fit as expected,1
5,Love it! Construct and materials used is expected to last a long time.  Keeps all my items organized and frees up space for more.<br /><br />Recommend it for small pouches.,1
5,fit as expected love Born.,1
5,Excell to have a charger at my desk.,1
5,Great quality leather. Sturdy construction and clips that really grip well.  Excellent quality at a truly affordable price!,1
5,glasses arrive and were exactly as described,1
4,"Great color, wearing it today!  Fits great and compliments my curves",1
1,"I have always ordered 42/44 mm and in other brands this is the size I wear......got this product that is clearly stated as 42/44 and its to small for my wrist by a considerable amount, for the price I paid i chalked it up as whatever<br /><br />but you need to know that it did not fit compared to other brands based on the 42/44 mm",0
5,So cute my 19 year old begged me for it!,1
2,"I ordered this before, I thought from Amazon, come to find out it was from Ebay.When it arrived my daughter noticed how plastic it was. My daughter put it on her arm one day later it broke. I searched e-bay and reordered. Not great quality.",0
5,Bought this ring for my son (10 years). While it is sized for an older child (teen) my son is very happy with it. It feel solid and not flimsy. It‚Äôs super cute since it opens up he like to move his hand to have the emblem swing open.,1
5,best thing I have ever worn. no looking for the holes,1
2,All the rings were nice expect for one that was really messed up which was very disappointing.,0
1,Way too small. Returned it and bought something else,0
5,Thank you for honoring we veterans with an honoriery hat.,1
5,Pic doesn't look like that and it is huge I got a small it could fit me I'm 5'3 130 so have to send back and try xsmall,1
3,Its not to bad. I will wear it.,0
5,"These flower earrings are beautiful, brilliant aquamarine color. Appropriate for any woman.  It fit and closes in safe manner. .....",1
1,It fell apart while I was in the middle of a bedside procedure and everything on my badge ended up on the floor.,0
4,Simple black watch band for my first generation Apple Watch. Can‚Äôt beat the price for only $2.99. I needed a simple black band for work! It‚Äôs comfortable and jelly like material.,1
1,Do not buy this cardigan! It is gross and the description is wrong.,0
5,This jumper is thin but it is really cute! Good sizing!!,1
1,"First time I wore it, one of the pendants came off",0
1,This is not a quality piece of jewelry. It is basically a piece of inkjet paper and printed and a poor resolution inserted into the charm.  I was fooled By the picture on the page. Save yourself money and don't be fooled. Needless to say I returned it.,0
1,"Too thin, not impressed with this and it hard to see the picture.",0
2,"It was pretty at first, but then the finish started to wear off after a week of wearing it. It is also alot bigger than I thought it was going to be. I wouldn't buy it again.",0
4,"These will fit up to 41"" waist with just stretching the belt a little. The adjustment clasp has a tall profile, and may dig in depending on where it lands on your body. Some stitches look like they may come out near the buckle. The colors are dark. The tan looks a bit green in some light & the blue is Super Bright.",1
2,One use wear,0
4,"When I received my package, there were no pins in the box, only the hat. I contacted the seller about this and the seller worked with me and was very kind.<br /><br />The hat itself is pretty good. Although it is a little soft and doesn't hold its shape very well, but since its not a super big hat to begin with, that may not be much of an issue.",1
3,I ordered 5/6 for my 3 year old thinking I could get at least a while of wear out of it. It barely fits her and the material in the back is quite thin. Also fits her mid thigh. I got it for $8 so I can‚Äôt complain but I won‚Äôt be keeping it .,0
4,Fast Delivery! Item as described,1
1,"Even the birds are singing about it! CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!",0
5,I liked them this is my sencond pair and would recommend them,1
2,The item is not made to proper sizes. I am usually a large and this extra large couldn't fit.,0
1,COMPLETELY SEE-THROUGH. The top elastic twists and is impossible to fix.,0
1,Both the leotard and the skirt are huge. Even more important is that the skirt does not match the the size of the leotard. With another words you can not use the skirt with the leotard from the set as they are not a set even though they are sold as such.,0
5,I use it with a compression tank and it helps massively the only down side its noticable under clothes because of the hooks on the front,1
3,"A little cheap looking, but nice",0
5,"This cuff is light and comfortable - although it replaces a slightly thinner silver cuff, I think I even like this one better.",1
5,I wore the headband to work and it made everyone smile.  I also wore it to trivia and got a lot of positive comments.,1
5,I‚Äôve warn the boots almost two years. I‚Äôve like them so much that I took them to a cobbler when it was time to replace the soles. They are waterproof out of the box but over time you will have to consign the for winter. Comfortable and easy to take off and put on.,1
5,For the OG office fans‚Ä¶ this is the perfect gift!,1
3,"cut way too low, I had to put a scarf on with it and tuck the scarf into my bra. To qualify this, I live in Vegas where EVERYTHING GOES! For me to say it's too low cut is a LOT!",0
5,Love. Perfect for vacation or BBQ. Extremely comfortable. Pockets.,1
5,Good fit. Beautiful sneaker,1
1,Not entirely sure what they mean by anti-glare; but didn't help much with what I bought them for.,0
4,"Cute dress, very soft and silky fabric. I ordered a large as I have gained some weight but it was too big.",1
2,Being 5‚Äô11‚Äù I bought a size up just in case. Not tall people freiendly. Too small in the torso.,0
5,"I love this dress, it's soft, true to size, light weight but not see through. The colors are much brighter in person.",1
4,Small but great prop!,1
1,4 sizes too small,0
4,"Look nice,but It is not water proof.",1
1,They don't fit my Smith frames !!,0
4,"I love this purse. It is roomy, with the huge inner pocket separated by a thin cloth divider, which helps with organization. Inside, it has a med sized zipper pouch on one side, 2 little pen/ lipstick/ earbud pouches on the other, and a key hook to keep you from digging around to find them. There is a roomy zipper pocket on the exterior of the purse, which is where I keep my phone for easy access, and the details on the outside are beautiful.<br />The strap is long, adjustable by buckle, and can easily be worn cross body. It smells fantastic, and the leather is thick, zippers are chunky but close smoothly. This is my new go to bag, it's a cavernous carry all and matches anything I wear.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars due to shedding issues from the strap, which is caused by the way it has been tanned. Any time I take it off I have to check my shoulder for leather dust. Don't get me wrong, it is supple, not dry; I think it is from the edges, hoping that will take care of itself after more wear.",1
5,"Daughters loved these shoes for Disney World, worn for about 8 hours.  (age 7 and 9, both have the black shoes)  The wires look like they'd be uncomfortable but two kids said they couldn't feel the wires near ankle.  They didn't use the remote, just pushed the button on shoe to change colors and turn off.",1
4,"these are replacement, so they are small, but this up-size fits.",1
5,My husband purchased two since I loved both the blue and the pink robes.  They fit perfectly!  They are lightweight and feel luxurious and beautiful on weekends when I'm lounging around in comfort mode.,1
5,Warm,1
5,very good,1
5,"I am always hesitant to order purses, clothing etc online because I always want to feel the item. I read a lot of reviews & this purse lives up to all the reviews. (I have only had this purse since Christmas.) The quality is amazing. The lining is a heavy satin type fabric and does not feel like it will snag or tear easily. The zippers are good quality.  The purse itself is made of a thick leather or leather type material. The bottom of the purse has 4 metal feet so the bottom of does not rest directly on the floor.  It is well made & the colors match the description provided by the manufacturer.",1
5,üëç,1
1,I haven't been this disappointed in a bathing suit in a very long time.  The stitching for the gathers is cheap causing it to be incredibly abrasive and itchy.  There is boning off under the arms that serves no purpose I can see and it digs in and is actually painful.  It looked okay but I was completely uncomfortable and could not wait to get back from the beach to take it off.  I will not be wearing it again!  Really unhappy with this suit!,0
1,Not much of anything in the paydirt only 3 little flakes of gold  2 little pieces of silver and no platinum at all hope you're luck is better than mine,0
1,"My daughter wears a 6, so I ordered these in a size 6. They fit me perfectly and I wear an 8.5! WAY too big!",0
5,I love colors.  If u wear size 2x in shirts order size 24. Mine fits great!!,1
5,These leggings are wonderful! Have ordered several pairs and just love all of them. Nice quality at a great price. Better than my Athleta leggings!,1
4,This dress set was perfect for 20's day at work. I should have looked at the pictures better - only the front of the dress has fringe!  Very easy/quick dress up!,1
5,Nice cap for cold winter walk. It‚Äôs warm and It keeps the sun out of my eyes when it‚Äôs out and snow from my face when snowing.,1
5,Came super quick just like the picture great quality,1
5,I really like this. It very helpful during winter days..<br />I like the fitting of it.,1
2,"One of the small crystals fell out, a week later the large crystal came out",0

5,Great product,1
5,Love it,1

5,Great,1
2,"It didn‚Äôt fit, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 160lbs & I ordered a large according to chart so please order 1 size up",0
1,"Very cheaply made, broke first day.",0
5,"True size fit, comfy, stays in place through practice and doesn‚Äôt shift around when doing lots of movement",1
5,does what it is intended to do,1
5,These bags are nice in appearance and very roomy with plenty of pockets for storage. And the straps are comfortable over the shoulder with plenty of strap for adjustments.,1
4,"After reading other reviews, I didn't expect much. The shipping date was a lie and this item takes over 30 days to get here from China. Amazon and The seller both responded promptly after my inquiries and assured me that they were in fact coming. When it finally arrived I was very happy with it. Others complained of a smell and that it was too small. I had no such issues. Great buy. Good product for the money.",1
4,Came earlier than expected. Perfect gift.,1
1,"Ordered two in different sizes, but received two the same size. Even the one that was the correct size didn‚Äôt fit right. It is oddly shaped and has a band that is very restrictive. Also- they do not provide good coverage in very cold weather. Do not recommend.",0
5,A good value for the money.,1
3,Will have tobretu4n fir larger size,0
5,Cute Cute many complements!! Love It as aTop,1
1,Turned brown in less than a week,0
5,Was a great gift at family reunion,1
3,"Beautiful shirt and it fit great,  how ever only after wearing twice a seem ripped by the shoulder.",0
3,Color not the same color ordered. But still hot pink. The sweatshirt looks more hot fuchsia online. But still nice quality.,0
2,"Didnt like it at all the zippers seem to fall more so i have to keep fixing them and the whole thing itself doesnt look too good, havent worb it since i dont like it when ive tried it on.",0
5, ,1
5,It looks just like the picture and fits great!!!,1
5,"Great dress, super cute & comfy! I got tons of compliments too!!",1
3,"The picture is very deceiving and is not a proper picture of the product. The balls on these are so small, they are practically the same size as the earring part. What you get is not what is pictured. Two of the balls also fell right off once I tried opening them. The small size is extremely small. I was really hoping they were going to look as they did in the picture but they do not. I would return them and order a different pair if I wasn't in need of hoops.",0
3,metal is bended,0
3,Order a size up... round small,0
3,Ultra thin material and runs on the small side. This dress would be good with a swim suite or bikini under it.,0
5,"I love this dress, I wore it to my graduation and got a lot of compliments on it... I will be ordering other colors thanks. I didn't get any pictures of the dress sorry but it's a must buy!!!",1
5,Love this dress! Super comfortable and cute.,1
1,Do you shorts are not flattering at all do not buy!,0
5,Very pretty beach cover up,1
5,"excellent!!this is perfect love it , would definitely buy it again, the sellers are prompt up on request.",1
5,Muy bueno,1
5,Beautiful and good quality,1
5,Love and want more!,1
4,"Kinda tight bracelet, but it's ok",1
5,Size down if you want it more fitted because it is oversized.  Pretty embroidery on the sleeves.  Comfortable and warm.,1
2,"If you are larger than a B cup, this is not the bodysuit for you. As other have mentioned the side boob and boob falling out the side was a real problem. The quality doesn't seem bad, but completely unwearable in my life. I had to request a return.",0
5,"I was looking for a military style watch that I could wear pretty much daily and came across this one from Burei. The watch design and colors are great. Personally I think they are fantastic. Despite being budget friendly this is one of my favorite watches now and something that I enjoy wearing every day. Even the canvas and leather combo strap is very nice. The glow in the dark feature is not super bright but you can still see it. Anyways, great deal. Absolutely worth it.",1
1,These don't hold or last. The first shrug of shoulder or lift if arm they break,0
3,This arrived super quick! Quality is ok and fit is a bit small. It‚Äôll work on those lounging around the house and I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs around days. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
5,"It's the right size for me and it has a place for a filter. Works perfectly, material is great for me not heavy",1
5,Muy bonito todo,1
1,"Very misleading description, the hearts are extremely tiny, I ordered 4 and it still doesn‚Äôt look big enough to wear as a necklace",0
5,This looks to be a very good quality belt.,1
2,"Super cool, but not true to size. Needed a 2 got maybe an 6 or 4. Had to return.",0
5,Wear it every day!,1
5,Fit well and I like them but they were hard to unscrew idk why the tops were screwed on so tight but I still can‚Äôt get the green or fake diamond ones to unscrew smh so I‚Äôm only wearing the purple one currently because the tan one just looks make up dirty,1
3,"Playing wore off fast and copper under it tends to turn most people green, myself included.<br />Other than that ‚Äúlove it‚Äù",0
5,I love it so comfortable and warm will going get another,1
3,Asked for an extra large and got a 2 x,0
5,Beautiful classy dress. Good quality. love it. Got a lot of compliments.,1
5,"Best goggles I‚Äôve ever owned. They don‚Äôt let any water in, and they don‚Äôt hurt my face while I wear them. I like how much bigger they are than traditional goggles, it definitely makes them more comfortable. It was also great they came with a nose plug and ear plugs. Such a great deal, would definitely recommend!",1
5,"These are very pretty and shimmery earrings. They are light and look dainty. The abalone really glistens when it hits the light. I will say they don‚Äôt dangle very long but just enough off the earlobe. I was surprised at just how beautiful the abalone actually looks with pearly greens, blues and white.",1
3,Unfinished edges.....we'll see how long they last,0
5,They actually stay on my baby's feet! And they're cute. The light pink booties matched most of my baby girl's outfits well. Perfect for winter.,1
5,Comes with a cute variety of different sized rings!! Looks so cute with your acrylic nails üòç,1
5,"This dress is beautiful, the fit is amazing.. The delivery was only 2 days and the material is soft and not flimsy.",1
5,Nice bag at a great price!,1
3,They were beautiful bracelets but the string or elastic string wasn‚Äôt good quality at all. They broke in two weeks.,0
5,Just as advertised. It is genuine shungite. A multimeter test gives it a consistent conductivity of less than 2 OHMS and up to as good as 1 OHM.,1
3,They don't look bad but for sure they are going to shrink and fade fast. They took over 3 weeks to arrive but for the price I guess you get what you pay for and these are not much.,0
4,"I LOVE the necklace, but the chain broke when I was trying to turn the necklace. It is so small and thin. I only wore it one day.",1
5,"This belt made me a star. My hubby REALLY LIKED the rachet feature!!! Got my son one, he liked the value for the quality (his was different look, same style). My daughter stole my son's belt. lol",1
2,Awful material. Fits decent.,0
2,The quality was nice but the shirt ran extremely small,0
1,"NOT STEEL!<br />Cheap, cheap, cheap!<br />Feels like/looks like silver coated resin.",0
1,"Beautiful print, but fits large and is very boxy.  No shaping through bust leaves lots of extra fabric between arms and chest. Returned.",0
5,"Bought it for my sister for a Christmas gift, she loves it! Got her a large, it fits her loosely but comfortably.",1
5,Loved this dress! Received many compliments!,1
1,"The material, faux leather, is too stiff, it hurt my ankles, I had to return them.",0
5,Love!!!,1
1,"Gave this away to a friend. It's really tight, the straps are confusing and never stay up where you put them, and the back is so low it shows your underwear. It also shows every lump, bump, or roll in your stomach. Not a fan of this one at all. I am 5'5, 139 lbs, and I ordered a medium.",0
5,"Great hoodie, keep ‚òù the good work.",1
5,Would def buy again,1
5,Love love love this!<br /> Got it as part of my Stevie Nicks Costume for Halloween this year! Fits perfect!<br /><br /> Expect a lot more purchases of this as I added a link to this on the Stevie Nicks group on Facebook I belong to! ‚ô•Ô∏è,1
1,Very upset that the box it came in was damaged and opened  it was supposed to be gifted unfortunately the box was defective and theres a unique smell on the shirts,0
5,This dress is beautiful with a petticoat skirt. Sorry I couldn't find a clearer picture.,1
3,"The cap is useful for extreme heat and sun rays, but it‚Äôs way too big and it looks messy. It doesn‚Äôt hold properly to the head.",0
3,I really wanted to love this set but it falls short of expectations. The print is super cute but the pants are not very soft and unfortunately do not stay up. The sports bra has a different clasp that makes it difficult to fasten.,0
3,Nice slippers but run very small - found a very similar pair in women's - purchased a 7 and they fit perfectly.,0
5,Comfortable with just the right amount of compression.,1
4,liked the plaid.  I got the black and white.  Good for around the neighborhood and for sleeping,1
2,The waist band in the bottoms is twisting up. That was at the first wearing. Won't order again.,0
5,Great shoes. Comfortable.,1
5,SO CUTE!!!,1
5,"I have 3 pairs of these pants, in different colors, and I love the fit and quality!",1
3,Just a bit larger than I like but i kept them.,0
5,Love anchors and nautical look.<br />Decent delivery time loos just like picture now if I could just get it on my wrist single handed.<br />I would recommend this light weight bracelet.,1
3,These pants run large.  I would never wear them outside.  More suitable for in home use.  Noty favorite purchase.  The fabric is thick and soft.  Maybe suitable for a homebound person.,0
5,Works good,1
4,It‚Äôs huge! Not what i was looking for...,1
5,Good belt for the price. Perfect for smart casual dress.,1
2,"This shoe has flower imprints on it, the leather is thin, and cuts into the foot.",0
3,Looks a bit cheap,0
5,I wish it came in more colors!,1
5,"I got several compliments on this when I wore it for the first time. Well made, comfortable, and very pretty.",1
1,Dress was not sewn correctly and the quality is inferior.,0
2,"I love all the designs I ordered, but scarf is VERY narrow. Thought it would be wider.",0
5,"I got these to hopefully help my little one crawl more easily since most of our floors are laminate, and the knee pads I‚Äôve found seem so bulky. These pants are a thinner material but super soft and stretchy, so they definitely can fit a wide range. It would be nice if the knees had a little extra padding in them, but otherwise they are great.",1
5,"Beautiful dress, good price for the quality. My girls looked stunning at their aunties wedding in these! Fit was good also!!",1
5,I sized up fits very nice..  looks good.,1
5,"Well made,great product.My daughter loved the little koala bear bag.",1
5,Nice mittens. Arrived on time packaged well. I think they will work well for my 2 year old granddaughter to play in the snow on Maine.,1
5,The band fit very well. Had a few links taken out. I like it because it is a little dressey what you out.,1
5,Beautiful!  Well made and much better in person.  Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day.,1
5,"i love this charm,  it is a great addition to my bracelet as a representation memory for my mother who passed away several years ago from breast cancer.  the thought is always on my mind!!!",1
5,Great casual dress.  Nice to have 100% cotton too.  Thinking about ordering in another color Here in the desert we have warm weather about 8 months each year.,1
5,These work beautifully!  Now wearing my jeans again with no problem. Highly recommend them.,1
4,My daughter loved it.  Only thing stopping me from the 5th star is the ears where difficult to pinon with the pin they came on I ended up having to remove the hair clip and attach them to a headband.,1
5,I like how comfy it is to wear.,1
3,"I find this dress to be pretty but it's not very flattering on mu pregnant body,  I'm 31 weeks and this dress makes  me look wide all over. I don't think it's meant to be worn as maternity dress .",0
1,They looked so cute.  I couldn‚Äôt wait to get them in the mail! But once I opened the box I realized how huge they were.  Desired to try them on anyways but they were high and not very comfortable to wear under clothes at all. I keep worrying they‚Äôd get  caught on something and rip out,0
5,I'm not crazy about the blue color but I still give it five stars. I got the smaller clip and it's perfect. I have my house keys on one ring and my car key on another ring. I put them both on this clip. It's very solid and the interlocking teeth is a nice feature. Even when I clip them to the ring on my tactical pants I feel very secure that nothing can get lost. This clip is not going to open accidentally but it's not hard to open it enough to remove a key ring or clip onto my pants.,1
3,I loved them but my husband who has to wear them feels like it's way too much shirt because it looks like a dress on him. But other than that they're great undershirts.,0
5,"It‚Äôs a little wider than I expected, but it works well for what I need. Good purchase all in all.",1
4,Size was a little snug but she loves it and the quality is great for the value!,1
5,As beautiful as in the photo !,1
2,wasn't red as expected,0
3,La tela no es suave,0
1,"This top was def., NOT well made. The top is short in length and nothing like the preview. The string necklace type is nothing like this top shown, they hang and it looks awkward  like it's a piece of material that was left behind, horrendous top. I will never buy from this shop again, looks super cheap and plain ugly. DONT waste your money.",0
3,"Okay, okay. I should have known by the brand name that they would be a hint too much like yoga pants for me, but I really was attracted by the fact that they were pull-on, cropped length and not voluminous. Sadly, I just felt like I was wearing stylish yoga pants and couldn‚Äôt see myself wearing them to work or dinner or whatever. They went back. But if you‚Äôre looking for stylish yoga pants with a belt loop, these are for you!!",0
5,"It is an extremely comfortable sports bra, both the fabric feel and in it's support. The breathability factor is as promised. Because some reviews stated it runs small, I ordered the next size up for which I'm glad. Mine came with the padding which is easily removed.<br />Bottom line, it's still the best one I've had, plenty of coverage with adequate support. Also, you can't beat the price for three well made sports bras!",1
1,Way too large and cheap material,0
1,the lens popped out after the third day of wearing them.,0
2,nothing special,0
1,"I ordered the large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 180 lbs. this top sucks. This top is really thick and heavy it was 75 degrees and I was pouring sweat.. Also, I‚Äôm a 38D and I could barely fit into the top because there is no stretch to it. So not for bigger breasts. Sure there are buttons in the back you can unbutton, but why would anyone wear the top with buttons open in the back?",0
1,It dies not fit true to size  returned it,0
5,One of my favorite hats. Super high quality from Mitch and Ness,1
4,Purchased for a birthday gift. Kid loved it. Went well with the Jordan sneakers we purchased.,1
5,Daughter loved and then ordered more in other colors,1
1,"This dress looked nothing like the one I received, the material was shiny, the color was off, I hated it!""",0
5,"Great design for face mask,I highly recommended this to any Batman fan!",1
5,This top was merely for my skirt.... FLAWLESS MATCH!,1
5,"I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and weigh 119 pounds currently right after my 4th baby. This tummy wrap is Perfect size for me. Very easy to put on and I can‚Äôt wait to see the tummy reshaped to its normal size! Also, this wrap stays in place really well, it won‚Äôt slip, which is exactly what I need. I will recommend this product to my fiends.",1
5,Great for loading with cold stuff. Keeps everything cold even when in the car for 2 hours.,1
4,"These are great, size was on spot. In cooler weather the should be layered over thin legging or tights as they are not warm tho I knew this prior to buying them. Great fir all seasons. Live em!",1
3,This shirt runs big. It's heavy and stretchy. The logo feels sticky to the touch even after being washed a few times.,0
5,Gorgeous Dress ...,1
1,"[[VIDEOID:c42dd57edef9281720515b5379aea6de]] The bra stinks! It's dirty, stained, and too much fabric is loose on the cups. The straps are dirty. Clearly this is USED. I'm beyond disgusted! This is unacceptable.",0
5,Great quality. Just like picture. He loved it as a birthday gift.,1
5,Bought these for my husband. Lightweight AND COMFY!,1
5,Beautiful and dainty. Exactly what I love!,1
5,I love the fit,1
2,Not true to size.  The red sleeves are not a vibrant red. They‚Äôre more an orange-red.,0
5,Fits nicely good quality,1
3,Great material fits a little too loose too see through,0
5,"This was such a great purchase.  I was looking through my previous orders and realized I never gave this a review.  I got this for my daughter,  The suit has very stretchy but secure material that literally lasted years.",1
5,"It's a great little money clip. This easily holds multiple cards and keep my bills secure.<br /><br />STRONG MAGNET. This magnet is so strong that when it's in my front pocket and I walk by a car, it attaches to the car through my shorts. LOL. It is quite funny to see that all of a sudden my shorts are attached to the car. It always catches me off guard. haha.<br /><br />Great product.",1
5,"Loved them, the back went far enough down the they were usable.",1
3,"Love it for spring, but it‚Äôs very see through. I‚Äôm not keen on wearing slips so it‚Äôs used as a cover up or I wear it with leggings",0
5,Fits nicely and it looks great!,1
5,I bought 2 bracelets and they fit perfectly.  I bling like crazy but it doesn't look cheap.  It arrived ahead of schedule so I'm completely satisfied,1
1,Very poor quality shoes,0
2,"This zipper pull or purse/backpack fob looked great in the photos and it does have nice bright colors, but it looks from the photos like it will be about this size or a quarter or a nickel, whereas when this arrived it is practically microscopic!  This was a gift for my mom and she cannot make out what is depicted on it.  Also the lobster clasp that is there ostensibly to attach it to a purse or zipper handle is so small that it is really difficult to try to fit it onto a normal handbag zipper.  Not sure it's worth sending back but I would not buy this again or recommend it.  I also find the seller's listing misleading--yes, photos are often magnified but sellers should make it really clear that is what they are doing and should clearly indicate the actual size when they are using highly magnified photos.  Not cool.",0
5,These caps are very well made and the material is sturdy! Love the patterns and my baby looks so cute in them! Definitely worth the buy!,1
5,Love it.  A proper British Royal hat fit for any occasion!,1
5,"I got this this as a bathing suit cover up for our vacation in Hawaii and it will be perfect! It‚Äôs cute, the material is light weight and flows nicely. It‚Äôs perfect as a summer dress or to go over your suit.",1
4,"Quick delivery and good ease with swapping the band. Fair ‚Äúgold‚Äù color, but it compliments black watch face well. Extra links for customized fit was a bonus!",1
1,bad material..don't buy it,0
5,"So far, I am very pleased with what I got for my money. Surely I could have spent easily $30 to $100 more for a different watch with a Seiko movement, sapphire crystal, and the rest, but as a budget watch, this watch perfectly met my needs. As far as the style, fitness, comfort, and finish, this watch totally delivers. There were minor quality control issues with mine, but nothing a little ingenuity couldn't fix. This watch feels and looks great on the wrist.<br /><br />Slight reasons to consider:<br />The bezel and dial color green don't perfectly match. It's close, but not perfect (no big deal).<br /><br />The movement/rotor is very loud (not a problem for me, but could worry some.<br /><br />The watch loses about 30sec per day (not the best, but not the worst in accuracy)",1
4,Great gift,1
5,Yessss put it over nothing or over some wire socks whooooooo knowssss they‚Äôre cute and cheap and one day I‚Äôll know what to do with them üòÇ,1
5,"Not super soft, but comfortable. Washes fine, not problem with anything. Fun shirt.",1
3,These hoops are very large in diameter. I just bent them up a little so they didn't stick so far out of my nose and they look fine.,0
1,The color changed before I even wear it...,0
1,Cheep and uncomfortable,0
5,"Love  the  dress....  Elastic at ankles....  Great  Loose  fit ,  great  cotton,  spandex  material.....WILL  BUY  another  color  also.......love",1
4,Fits well! Only thing I had to do was loosen up the neckline droop area by gently pulling on it. I think it was tight b/c of being in package. Sexy and modest top! :),1
5,"I wear this ring so often, that my coworkers will ask me about it when I don't have it on. I absolutely love this ring. Fits nicely, great product.",1
5,"I‚Äôm happy with it! It‚Äôs just that right size and feels comfortable. I just got it today so I can‚Äôt speak on durability, hopefully it lasts.",1
5,I love these light weight sweatshirts.  the sleeves are so fun.  I love it.  so soft and easy to wear.,1
5,"Finally, a key ring that doesn't require a ""tool"" to open. Quick to open, slide on and slide off. It is secure once on the key, also. Very light weight, too. I guess I was surprised by that. I'm looking forward to using them for many years to come.",1
1,"Did not look as good in person, I had bought these as a gift for my mom. Would not purchase this item again.",0
5,Buen producto,1
5,"Warmest boots I've ever owned, and I live in Buffalo, where we get SNOW!  Couldn't be happier with these boots.",1
2,"Fit's very small. I wear a large/xl juniors and it was a task getting it on, I order a 3x due To comments but I probably needed a 4x",0
2,"I should have ordered a larger size, was disappointed with sizing.",0
1,Started turn black after 2 days!,0
2,"There is thick stiff padding for your back and not where you need it.  Additionally, the leg holes are angled not horizontal.  They are long in the crotch and short on the sides. Strangest fit ever.",0
5,What was unexpected about these is how freaking adorable they are!!!<br />Whoooooooooooo is the cutest? Who? Who? Whoooooo?<br />The earrings are.<br />A nice touch with the sparkly crystal on the post.<br />Thank you Nathan for my wonder anniversary presents!<br />I have sensitive skin and was able to wear these all day without problem.,1
3,Smaller than I thought.,0
5,Great product will help at work greatly,1
5,My son loves these boots so much.,1
1,"The material is 90% polyester- basically as stiff as a Halloween costume. The detail specifically listed, ‚Äú HIGH-TECH INTERLINK FABRIC. Fabricated from 79% polyester and 21% spandex...‚Äù also, the bottom flares rather than staying tight on the calf. They look a bit more like pointe pants than leggings, do not breathe well, and are not comfortable for working out.",0
5,Great quality and comfortable fit.,1
5,"Perfect fit with comfortable stretch everywhere. I""m petite, 5,1. , Fluctuating 5-7 pounds over and under like most women. Diane Gilman, designer understands this and her jeans are sized appropriately. Thanks for great style and Value",1
5,"AWESOME,  Was a hit got it for my Daughter in-law,  we all Love Schitts CreeküòÅ",1
1,Very disappointed and waste of money.  Too small. Returned for refund,0
4,Nice design.,1
5,"I owned a coupon wallet from Buxton before.  However, this style is my favorite.  The interior is beautiful and of a nylon type of material.  The side where the cards fit is great and comes with a pen. You can hold your cash/envelope system in the zippered part or use it for coupons.  You can use the snap side for your credit/debit cards, make a shopping list and other items in the slip pocket.  Great wallet and I love the price!",1
4,Like it,1
5,"Looks great, high quality.",1
2,Thinner than I expected.  Afraid she'll break it. Don't think it was worth 25$. Maybe 10$-15$ at best..,0
5,Great no complaints,1
5,Band is soft and quaint. Perfect sizing no issues.,1
5,Good quality great fit.,1
3,I saw product made by them in the past and that was why I ordered one for a friend.  It is very cheap looking and friend didn't care for it.  There use to be a leather tooled version that was really very nice looking.  Selling this one off at a garage sale to recoup my money at this late date.,0
5,"One of my favorite shirts, it‚Äôs perfect for my car.",1
2,The busy is way larger then the body of the dress. With some tape and a pin I could wear it.,0
5,Love it!,1
1,nope,0
2,"The band looks great, but the clip that lets you adjust the length.... does not hold so every time you put it on you have to readjust it and it creeps longer and longer.......  I would not buy this particular one again.",0
2,Did not like these. Did not fit around my ankle the way I thought they would.,0
5,Product was as advertised and delivered as promised.,1
3,Super cute but much smaller then expected and feels like it was made cheaply.,0
3,love the material .,0
3,"Very stylist item, but not warm.  Its just something to throw over a top at night.  More for summer wear. I wash and dried in the dryer, did not affect the sizing.  Holds up good after washing, but do not recommend for cold weather wear.  More for style.",0
1,It hasn't even been a year and it stopped working.,0
5,Super cute and fast shipping.,1
5,Slimming and flattering!,1
1,These were fraying along the length and would stay tied.,0
3,"Not a bad mask but could not get over the ""toxic"" smell and had to return it.",0
3,Only giving it three stars because they were soft. I ordered XL because someone said size up.. don‚Äôt size up. Get your normal size or maybe even size down if you want them really right. BUT beware because they‚Äôre extremely see through. Like hold them up to the light and you can see right through them. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 200lbs and xl was too big on me for reference. I‚Äôd probably get a large if I were to order again.,0
4,We really like these shoes. They are a great value and for well.,1
5,Seem to work well.,1
3,"I'm conflicted on this review...<br />Pros: the pants were actually long enough, which doesnt happen often, especially when ordering online. The material is crazy soft.<br />Cons: it may just be my body shape, but the hemming on this fit at really awkward places. It wasnt really under my bust, but wasnt my waistline either... honestly it felt like it had reimagined where it all is supposed to be and ended up making me look even more pregnant than I already am, lol.",0
2,Order 2 sizes up trust me ladies its no joke. Take my word. What a waste of money.,0
3,Fun but seem to stretch out easily,0
1,"This shirt fits small. Need to order 2 sizes bigger. Also came a wrinkled mess. Washed, dried and had to iron.",0
1,Cheap made,0
3,I truly love these overalls but one button fell off right out of the package & the rest were loose. So sewed & reinforced all of the buttons. The pants are very comfortable. ..,0
2,It was a Halloween costume of Evie in Descendants.  It was not worth the costume because it was not the real costume.  It was a photo printed onto fabric.  Don't buy this.  It's not worth the 45-50 dollars.,0
5,The socks are comfortable and have just the right amount of compression for my needs.,1
3,I bought a size 10/12 which I believe is an intermediate but it was just way too tight. The quality of the leotard is nice and it seem like it would fit well I think I will go a size bigger. I am hoping the size is not just off. I wish they had a better size chart.,0
3,okay...,0
2,Disappointed with the clarity of these stick-on readers.  It's like reading through an aquarium.  Not the crisp clear view I expected.,0
3,Beautiful!,0
4,"Way way to small and I got the biggest they had.  I'm a average to small guy.  5'7&#34; tall and about 175 lbs.  If I loose a little wieght by next summer it'll  be great!  Can't wear it till I do, but I do love it.  Looks good!",1
1,Correct size choice in but too tight,0
1,"They fell apart after 1 use, plus they are too big for 10 year old. Very disappointed.",0
3,Waders run pretty small. I ordered a 14 and honestly i wouldnt even call them a 12. Foot was cramped with a light sock.,0
1,"Runs VERY small, not standard to size chart at all",0
5,I love the way it fits across my body.  It is secure yet easy for me to get into.,1
5,"Best 2pack value. Purchased because of the  great price.<br />No longer looking for glasses to change out, because they will always go into the holders, except for the 3rd pair I'm wearing.",1
2,"I am petite (5'0""), and the Small was too large.  The shoulders are very wide and it makes for an awkward fit. Too bad!",0
5,Omg... These are so comfy.. When I opened them. I was like really..I'm not going to fit in these....But honey all this got in them pants.. I will be getting more styles..,1
4,This petticoat is perfect for someone who is petite.,1
5,Cute like pictures. I like the slinky material. I'm 5' 5&#34; 127. I got a med because I wanted a looser fit,1
5,I loved the glasses because they had pretty diamonds.,1
1,"These shoes were terrible.  They gave my daughter terrible blisters in several places and the leather was already bubbling and starting to come apart after just a few days.  They are also made very narrow, unlike other See Kai Run shoes.  Inferior product, beware!",0
1,These do NOT have green lenses.,0
5,I love the double pouch.  You can carry your sunglasses in one pouch and reg in the other.  I put my Iphone in one and my sunglasses in the other.  I love it!,1
5,"Really nice. I recommend putting something that's made of paper in the back, because it seems like pulling a credit or ID card out of the back will wear out the magnetic strip over time.",1
3,The product is too tight and I am a thin person,0
3,"I like it, good material and on me",0
5,Love these!!  They are so super cute!!,1
5,"I got this for my mother in law for a Christmas gift, and I think I‚Äôll tuck a few more small gifts inside. Very nice quality, feels sturdy, and the color is fun. I like the shiny gold zipper.",1
1,I give it the one star for looking nice. I could wear them only once. It tore apart the first time I wore them.,0
2,Really pretty but broke really easily,0
3,"I ordered a size XL and these are pretty small. I do have wide hips but usually an XL fits me fine. I wear a size 16 or 18 (depending on maker). I am currently losing weight though, so I guess they will fit me eventually. I do love the quality and the print is so cool. I am super bummed that they run smaller. Oh well. I would buy them again though.",0
5,Looks beautiful with my collection,1
5,Ove the look and size,1
5,I Love these pants.  Fit great and very comfortable.,1
5,fit just like I needed and I prefer the stirrups - especially in snow on the trail,1
5,Excelente,1
3,"They work fine, but they're heavier than others I've had in the past.",0
1,This did not work and I don‚Äôt know how to reach the seller. I would like a replacement or a refund.,0
5,Beautiful! Just the right size and it glows! It's elegant and but too big. It's perfect.,1
4,"Shirt is advertised as oversized, and it is, but that is what I was hoping for and I don't look like I'm swimming in it.  It's comfortable and the small is perfect for me (I'm 5'4&#34;, 130).  The fabric is not polyester as listed, but seems to be cotton.",1
5,"Good fit, unique, & sassy to support the Packers. Go Pack Go!",1
4,"There are some great things about these panties and there are some not-so-great things.  This are very light and breathable and the lace on top helps to prevent it from rolling down.  While wearing them, they did roll down a bit on my back, but that could be attributed to my extra layer of &#34;fluff.&#34;  These panties are definitely cuter/sexier than you normal high-waist control top panties. They were very comfortable in the thigh and inner leg area.  These panties do not form a visible panty line (which is a definite plus)! Lastly, they are very soft!<br /><br />Now on to the not-so-good things... While I appreciate them being light and breathable, I'm afraid they won't last very long.  The pair that I opened already had a little hole in it (I ordered two), so I think I will go ahead and send back the unopened pair.  The fit on the bottom portion was outstanding, but the top is definitely a &#34;control&#34; top and was a bit difficult to squeeze into.  I did reference the sizing chart, so I am confident that I ordered the correct size. Overall a good panty but be aware that the top portion is indeed a &#34;control&#34; top and does not stretch very much.",1
1,Not comfy. Very tight. Smaller than listed,0
5,smaller frames than expected,1
3,"I am 6'5&quot; 188 lb, athletic build.  I bought a medium for part of a halloween costume. The fabric is pretty snazzy and the shirt fits snug enough to show musculature, which is what I wanted for the costume.  I expect the next size up would be loose around the abs, which wouldn't be the effect I want for the costume.  You can see in the model photo on the website, the model is pretty athletic looking, and they are wearing size that is somewhat looser around the abs.  They are probably a lot more comfortable.  I find the shoulders tight, especially where my arms emerge from the torso of the shirt‚Ä¶ I hope it stretches out with wear.  for a costume, not so big a deal.  the other thing that I find more annoying is that the shirt is just very short.  if I raise my arms it rises up and my abdomen is uncovered.  If I hold very still, it looks good for the costume, but my arms may go numb shortly.<br /><br />Update:  I put on some more muscle and it became impossible to wear. My teenage daughter snagged it.",0
2,Hard to open which is problematic if you live in a rainy area....,0
3,"Although charming, these Fluevogs were quite short in the toe and not at all flattering to my foot.",0
5,"Took a while to get here,  but it‚Äôs VERY nice!!",1
3,"it works how it says, but the neck part is very short and i had to add to it to cover it and the nose on the mask doesnt stay up and its annoying to constantly adjust it.",0
5,I have bought this recently for a japanese themeed tea-party I had going. I bought those kimonos for all people attending and they loved it a lot and everyone took their piece with them home. It can be your own short personal kimono or like a robe to wear. I loved this product.,1
1,Tool for removing link pins is very cheap. First push of pin it bent and then snapped off. Now cannot put links back together to use. Would not recommend unless you have better tool already or take to a watch shop for them to use their tools.,0
1,"I have started reading Amazon reviews before buying ""seen on tv"" products.  Zoomies got only one star from people who wanted to use them<br />as binoculars (reason they were invented).  The three good reviews were to watch people, mainly girls.  At least they are good<br />for something.  I will not, however, buy Zoomies.  Thanks for the reviews.",0
2,"It was really small, not worth purchasing.",0
1,Rose on shoulder damaged. Glue is exposed.,0
2,These shorts are extremely THIN. You can see through the gray shorts.,0
5,I bought this on a whim. You never know what you're going to get online but this is adorable and fits great!,1
5,Best shades on the market,1
3,These are incredibly unnatractive but very comfortable.,0
3,A bit too tight,0
5,Wonderful fit! I get lots of compliments when I wear this dress. Love this brand!,1
2,The shoes look great and my toddler loved them but it's been a month and one of the shoes already stopped lighting up.,0
5,Comfy,1
5,bought more!! best items. very happy,1
1,Horrible y corriente tela,0
1,Toooooo tight,0
1,"Watch band came in wrong size. I have a Samsung Gear 2Neo which this band was supposed to fit according to the item description, also one of the pictures shown is of my watch but the item is too small. I have returned the item and purchased another band from another seller and hopefully that one comes in correct size.",0
5,Made well !,1
2,"Oh no, these are thinner than my t-shirt. I'm looking for work pants, this type of material won't do. It would most likely rip, also zippers are not pockets, just for show.",0
2,Clip on outside broke off in less than 90 days and sleeves inside were torn away from inside. Still tried to make it work without sleeves but soon after clip broke off. Not worth $20 for such a short life span of product. Wish it would have lasted longer I kinda liked it at first.,0
2,This is a good fit - but it fits more of an athletic fit than compression. I would go a size down if I wanted compression- alas there is no extra small. So small will have to do.<br /><br />I have an addiction to the Spiderman compression shirts. So I ordered this one as it mimics the advanced armor suit in the ps5 game.<br /><br />The images on amazon is better looking than the actual product itself. I think the photos of the product is a computer mock up so the colors are crisp but the actual shirt the printing is not as crisp. I have close up shots and far photos.  It looks pretty ok from afar like a monet bit looks fairly mediocre up close.<br /><br />It ultimately looks like an illustrated shirt and the printing is not tight.  I may send it back and wait for 2nd generation- not quite worth the $20 dollars - should be like $12‚Äì$15 due to the sloppy print.<br /><br />I think I might send it back.,0
5,"I love how this looks with my bracelets that I wear daily, and I love how it conceals my fitbit perfectly. The silicone bands usually rub against my skin and leave it a little sensitive, but this fits great, and I love the touch of sparkle!",1
4,Did not fit well at waist,1
1,"Updated: Cannot be used as a wallet. Can't put in US currency without folding. Can't close properly with more than a couple credit cards. Holds phone securely, so I will try for a while just as a protective cover. Interferes with our somewhat weak cell phone signal at home when closed, so I had to lay it open all the time. Ditched this and got a different one that has a wider spine to allow more stuff in wallet.",0
3,"Tiny size aside, the backlight is a joke.",0
1,Very small and stiff fabric,0
1,Garbage. Won't stay on. If you are looking for a fast and effective way to destroy or lose your Charge 5 then look no further,0
1,No he podido recibir mi reembolso,0
1,I hate this purse.,0
5,"I like everything about the Jacket.  It is very lightweight and very warm.  It is a little fragile, but this is urban wear, not for ski slopes, mountain climbing or walking through the woods.  Secret chest pocket is practical and useful.  A little bit tight on me but I would by this jacket in this size again.",1
4,"Easy to install and removing links was stait forward with the tools provided.<br />Its pulled a hair or two but not to the point I wouldn't use it.<br />It really beats the original band that comes with the sunto watch.<br />As of this review,  I have worn the band for one full week.",1
1,Very hard and painful to peel off.,0
1,Tiny...horrible and cheap,0
5,Bought this outfit for Halloween.  Was amazed how well it is make. Very comfortable. Was extremely please!,1
5,"These gloves are gorgeous - stylish and warm, too",1
5,Great product!! Fit was Exactly as I expected,1
5,like walking on air!  lots of  people asking about them!,1
1,They work if you take them off  before you shower. More for dress up & going out . Not everyday rings. They do tarnish & turn green. Some that I have bought are really tough & strong material but still do tarnish a little bit. Depend who you buy from & what you buy.,0
4,Very comfortable,1
3,"The material is cute and I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too see-through even though it was white. I've ordered a couple of dresses from Amazon and learned quickly that I usually size up because I'm not great at remembering to pull them out before they hit the dryer. I ordered this a size larger than I usually wear anticipating it shrinking in the wash. For better or worse it did not shrink at all. With this style, the larger size looks like I'm wearing pajamas. The chest is very roomy and the sleeves are a little longer more like a unisex t-shirt than a cute fitted dress. The pockets are great, the material holds up well and doesn't get super wrinkly. I might try again in another size.",0
4,Fit as expected very warm yet light... I‚Äôm on the go all the time so they are perfect for me.,1
5,Stunning piece - I love it.,1
3,The buckles get stuck .,0
2,like idk if ur into shirts with lace that comes up so high it goes to ur collar bone n scrunches in ur pits and then goes down so low it hits mid thigh but im tryna b a hoe so it aint for me<br /><br />also the material was mad cheap,0
5,Great winter boots!!,1
4,Great hat! Only wish the elastic held shape longer. It gives quickly,1
5,It‚Äôs how it shown in the picture. Great fabric quality. I do recommend for this summer days,1
5,"A problem I've noticed with plus sized jeans on Amazon is that the pockets are WAY too small, which make your ass look HUGE.  The pockets on these are perfect!  These jeans have just the right rise and stretch and are very flattering!",1
5,Everybody loves my hunni glasses,1
1,Veil is still and doesn't have an overall high quality look.  Ours had small holes.  Do not recommend due to quality of material and odor.,0
3,I really like the style but The material is thin. The XL is good for my hips but the top is a little lose but overall I like it.,0
1,Did not function! It was delivered broken!,0
5,this is very nice looking my Grand daughter loved it,1
5,I didn't read about the product and thought I was getting 3 but there's actually 6. It came in a nice little velvet black bag with pull together strings. I was very impressed for the price and I've wore them multiple times with no issues.,1
3,material was thin,0
5,Not too heavy. Nice weight and size. Very pretty and true to photos on website,1
2,It is what it is. I guess I got what I paid for. The pink with the yellow gold looks almost like a gumball ring.,0
5,Very nice sunglasses. Easy to wear. Dark tint.  They will be great for the summer at the pool. Nice polarization.,1
1,Not even worth the $9.99,0
5,muy Buena calidad los compare con unos de marca reconocida y la verdad q megustan mas estas gafas,1

5,Very good for office,1
3,"The ‚ÄúJPL‚Äù is rather thin and matted, but the hat quality is good.",0
5,This stone has a darker vein running through which give it a more casual look.  I love them.,1
3,The necklace fit beautifully and was quite the statement piece. The lower rating is because the top attachment of the center spider and web fell off after 2-3 hours of wearing it. I had to break it off at the bottom of the web so as to continue wearing it for the day and I will attempt to reattach it at a later time. It's still a favored piece though. Just as beautiful as the picture.,0
1,The vendor sent out an unfinished blouse. No hem around the bottom and sleeves. The embroidery was nice but the material wasn't very good.,0
1,These don‚Äôt hold onto the ends of the glasses. Not worth the constant worry of the loss.,0
4,fit is big - will fit my daughter in about 5 years (!),1
3,they are cute but only work on really think flip flop thong sandles,0
5,I always have a hard time finding shoes that are wide enough and supportive enough. These are great! Very comfortable and I love the wide toes. I also really like the fabric material and that they came in black.,1
5,Finally found a light weight summer shoe that actually slips on and doesn't fold at the heel,1
5,Son is very happy üòÅ,1
5,Good quality and keep you warm on cold Arizona nights.,1
1,"Are these for a babydoll head? Much too small. Unless you have a babydoll-size head, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!",0

1,"These are weirdly polyester and the strangest, cheapest material ever. Very uncomfortable.",0
5,great,1
3,not much tummy control going on with these...I was looking for more compression and these are just like yoga shorts.....,0
3,"The hat is a nice hat, but the decal is just that...a cheap iron-on decal.  I was hoping to wear this hat as a primary 'round-town hat, but I will probably just use it as a work hat in the garden.  Decal doesn't look like it will hold up in the washing machine, so will probably have a plain hat soon.",0
5,Value for üí∞<br />Nice patchwork stitching.,1
5,"Arrived on time, is very beautiful and well made. My niece loves it.",1
3,Couldn't fit my large head. Avoid if you have a large head.,0
5,Great hat..fits good..good quality,1
4,"Overall a solid shoe. The 48 size fits my size 13 feet, but are not as wide as I'd prefer. Will use shoe stretchers to get the toe width I need. Hope that helps.",1
5,Well made,1
2,"Very nice looking, that's why there's more than one star. After two months I started seeing black residue from the band rubbing off on my wrist. Four month after purchase, the nub that the clasp closes on broke off and now the band is unusable.",0
2,It‚Äôs cool but ehh it could have been better made<br />Better quality material,0
5,I wear a size 10.5 to 11 and they fit perfect. But the silicone pads are the ultimate. The socks stay where they're put and never slide down.<br />Thanks for a great product and at fantastic price!,1

1,"This top is so small I can't  even get it over my head. I DO NOT HAVE A PRINTER TO PRINT A RETURN LABEL.  Amazon tried to send me to the seller's ""return "" page but repeatedly failed.  This is a mismarked and unusable throw away..don't deal with this seller!",0
1,It arrived broken...,0
5,I LOVE THESE SOCKS THE DIFFERENT COLORS AND THEY GET SOFTER AS YOU WASH. I HAVE 3 PAIRS NOW. GREAT SOCKS FOR WINTER.,1
2,Not a fan. This was super cute in the pictures but the sleeves were huge on my arms and the cut was strange. I thought I must have gotten this from Wish until I saw this on my old amazon order list. Wish I‚Äôd tried to get a refund.,0
3,SOME LOOK REALLY GOOD QUALITY OTHERS DON'T,0
2,"I like the colors and the patterns and I really wanted to like these socks; however, these socks seem to be made for children - not adults.  The sock is way too small for an adult foot.  My foot is not exceptionally large and I really have never had a problem with socks fitting before.  First, the socks were difficult to get over my heel.  I thought it maybe had something to do with the intricate pattern and that they would stretch a little once worn.  Wrong.  Within minutes my legs seemed to actually be swollen above the socks and they were also difficult to remove.  I will not buy these again.",0
5,Great!!!,1
5,I have received so many compliments on the watch band. It is a good looking band. You can dress it up or down.,1
5,"Daughter Loved it... lots of room, stylish  & she loves  BLING",1
1,"Mala calidad. Pedi 150 y aunque este marcado, el tama√±o real era de 120. Malisima calidad. No recomiendo este vendedor.",0
1,Product much smaller than expected. I can't wear it. It's also cheaply made.,0
5,I have gotten so many compliments from both female and male. I wore this with my new cowboy boots. Very sexy!,1
1,Size was smaller than should be xl more like medium,0
4,I like the color and the touch screen works great.  The only problem is that it doesn't allow for fingerprint recognition.  I got this for my daughter so she can carry her phone at school and not have to actually get it out to use it when texting me.,1
5,Fits perfect and wash nicely,1
1,I ordered a 5 ! A 3 was sent! The item is poor quality for the price. Fabric is cheap in appearance. Now I have to eat it or return for refund not to mention the inconvenience of one less Christmas gift for my grandson!,0
3,"This is a nicely shaped, very lightweight jacket.  The hem of the back hit my beltline, so it's not too short.  I am a size 10-12 and I ordered the XL, which fit just right.  It arrived pretty wrinkly, so I will need to iron it out both for the wrinkles and to get the lapel to lay as in the picture.  I will use this in the spring and summer for work with a sleeveless white shirt and tan capris.  I think it will be a nice addition to my seemingly all-black wardrobe!",0
4,"I'm 5'8"" - 150 lbs - size 6 in womens clothing.  These pants were very cropped & the top was way too short & wide in the size M that I ordered.  If the top was even just a few inches longer - it would have made a huge difference, but being short & wide allows for too much air up & under the top.  Otherwise, the material is thick & soft like a baby blanket, which is exactly what I wanted.  I returned these pjs, but could see how others might like them.",1
5,This Vooray bag was a gift for my daughter. She loved it!,1
3,There is no instructions that came with the watch.  I didn't know how to set the other two small timers.  The stems are hard to pull out.<br /><br />I would not recommend this watch to anyone.,0
5,These airings are absolutely beautiful I love them,1
3,"The description suggested ""true to size"" it is not. I suggest going up a couple sizes. Will be returning.",0
5,They are so soft & wonderful to run in!,1
5,"Not super into Harry Potter myself, but it worked as a last minute Xmas gift.",1
3,"Pretty and well made, but delicate with a very thin chain. The leaf is also very large, so it's not great for someone who likes dainty or understated jewelry.",0
5,I got this ror my daughter and she just loves it  plenty of room and she can still wear a coat.,1
4,"What a cute purse! I bought this for a vacation I'm going on and it's so cute and colorful, kind of retro-looking. It's not the most expensive looking purse but you get what you pay for. I like the fact that it does have numerous pockets and dividers so I can organize what's inside the purse. Can't wait to use it!",1
4,Shirt is not off the shoulder like it shows in pic.,1
5,So beautiful and dainty.,1
3,"So I bought these pajamas by the reviews that I read, when I took them out of the package I was so disappointed! They are very stiff almost like a light cardboard feel, 100% cotton? I even tried to wash them and added a lot of softener and they‚Äôre still stiff, unfortunately I can‚Äôt return them because I washed them! So I am stuck with them, only good thing I can say about him they‚Äôre cute and that is it",0
5,Absolutely beautiful üòç,1
2,Cheap,0
4,I bought these for around the house. They don't look perfect on but they hit the soft an comfy mark perfectly,1
2,"I ordered this to wear on mother‚Äôs day and love the minty green color buuuut it was a bit larger than I expected which I could deal with but the bigger issue is it has a cut/slice/tear in the fabric of the skirt a couple inches above the hem of the skirt in the very front! So now I have to return it (for a smaller size while I‚Äôm at it) but don‚Äôt get to wear on mother‚Äôs day. I even got a cute vintage purse to match and coordinating heels and belt üò¢ For sizing reference, I ordered an XL and am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 188lbs with a 38‚Äù busy and 30‚Äù waist. (Side note: I ordered hoping I could still nurse in it and you can)",0
5,Wonderful gifts,1
5,Just what I wanted,1
4,Missing the screws. Already color  shows wear and only wore it for 4 days.,1
5,Very pretty. Chain is good quality too.,1
1,No llego ni el color ni el dise√±o del camuflado que estaba en la foto de muestra.<br />El acabado interior es deficiente.,0
1,After putting it on the design was fainter and stretchy looking and I got a size bigger. I would not order from this company again.,0
1,"This is not made of cotton, check the description before you buy. It polyester and heavy and hot for sleeping.",0
2,"Seems more like a long t-shirt than a dress.  Didn't flatter my figure at all.  I'm 5'2"", 180lbs and got an XXL.  The arms near the armpit area were tight and uncomfortable but if I sized up any more the dress would be completely boxy.  I ended up returning it because it just wasn't nice looking.",0
2,The cups of suit are molded and very large.  Best for big busted gals.,0
5,Wife loves its,1
4,These were gorgeous although I thought they‚Äôd be a little smaller on the buttons,1
5,I bought my wife a claddagh ring from the claddagh store in Ireland this year and this is a very beautiful addition.,1
5,Very nice case,1
5,"The color of this top is perfect .  The top is excellent quality.  The length is great, even for someone on the short size.  Not too long or too short.  The arms were a little long but would be perfect for someone a little taller. This is a very cute, comfortable top. I really like the style of the ruffled sleeves as they  add a touch of ""dressiness"".  I really like this top and would definitely recommend.",1
2,Terrible material for face. It‚Äôs burlap. Thick and scratchy.  :/,0
5,"Lasts forever, extremely durable, perfect for working in a variety of bad-weather situations.",1
5,"crazy about this bag! my makeup fits in one zipper pouch, my meds and keys in another; the third is a total bonus!",1
5,"Great product.For a 10 yr ,tall , skinny 62 pounder, the lg size after washing in cold is just great. My gdau loves them.",1
5,I give them in a birthday gift bag,1
5,Absolutely beautiful a little heavier than I was expecting but I still love them.,1
4,"They really are stainless, so no itch from nickel allergy. Very pretty & a nice size. Worth every penny. If they come out in additional colors, I'll order another set.",1
3,These are somewhat hard to stay on my little one's foot and they are hard to get on. He loves them and they seem comfortable for him.,0
4,"These work really well. But they don't look very good under clothes if you go too small (haha). I should have upped the size but it wasn't available. If you want to walk around your SO with this on though, they'll probably dig it because without clothes on it's extremely flattering and VERY cheap for what it does. I like it a lot. I just didn't get the right size but no regrets :)",1
4,"Great communication from seller, package arrived quickly.  Only problem is it‚Äôs extremely tight.  I could barely get it clasped and it felt like it was cutting off my circulation.  Will not be able to wear this one.  The other four I bought are perfect size.",1
4,Very nice,1
5,Perfect gift for a lady trumpet player,1
5,"I had to buy a few T-shirts for my son. They look great on him. They are Machine washable ,and fancy",1
1,The watch band broke after just 3 days. Cheaply made. Would not buy again.,0
5,Great fit,1
5,"I do love these leggings. They feel comparable to high end workout brands. I also love the fact that it has no front seam. I'm 5'2, about 100 lbs. and I got an XS. I don't think anyone at all larger or taller than me would be comfy in these. (especially the length, it hits right above my ankles)",1
1,Cheap cotton not worth the money made out of bad T-shirt material very disappointing,0
1,they shrink easily,0
4,"Would be perfect if it had buttons, otherwise, as expected.",1
5,"The materials, leather and stitching, are high quality.  Other reviewers have reported that their stitching is coming apart (?)  Really?!  I'm not a particularly gentle guy and I can't imagine a scenario where this thing doesn't last 10 years.<br /><br />Very comfy in my front pocket of my pants or suit jacket.<br /><br />Cards stay accessible and don't disappear down in the wallet -  so you can grab them, even a fudge finger like me has no trouble.  Never going back to a traditional bifold.<br /><br />EDIT After a year, still going strong.",1
3,These are great shows shoes but they do not breathe well and After 3 wears already have an odor,0
1,Arrived broken.  The small ring attached to  the scarf tube was broken off.,0
4,I like the pattern and fabric.  Inseam fit me fine.  They were a bit on the snug side where the long pants fit perfectly.  A bit on the snug side even if plus size.  I would buy them again.,1
3,Gifts for my team and they liked them,0
5,These are cool,1
2,I ordered a XL and it was extremely big around the waist & the jacket was too big.. So you‚Äôll have to order a size down! I want purchase from the vendor again!,0
4,"Sizing was a bit too small for me, returned due to sizing and didn't really like the way it looked on me...just due to personal style preference. Otherwise it was well-made and nice material, I just recommend sizing up.",1
4,Weird cut!<br />And not enough lopps for the belt,1
2,didn't know they were like a silk material....threw them out...didn't fit right...ugh,0
3,Beautiful top.  Somewhat slim around the hips but very pretty.,0
5,I love the color and the cap. I am big New York Yankees Fan. I cannot wait to wear the cap for my Hawaii Trip to represent NYC.,1
5,These are so soft and cozy. There is a good amount of stretch. I would recommend these.,1
1,Not very flattering and very boxy‚Ä¶ returned!,0
2,"I returned this shirt. It was quite thin fabric and is a little more tan in color than yellow. It didn‚Äôt fit super well on me, and I was bothered by the ink smell on it probably from screen printing.",0
5,"Very high quality.  The tag inside had a MSRP of $45.  The wallet is a bit larger than my last one, which I prefer.  It has plenty of card slots plus the middle license window too.",1
1,Came folded and to forever to get straightened out. Wore it twice and it stated to fall apart. Waste of money.,0
5,"I'm a cat loved, so can't go wrong with this shirt. It fits to size, comfortable.",1
5,"I bought this dress to wear when I was in Mexico on a missions trip. Wanted something light yet dressy, this was perfect. Fit as described, super soft, has pockets!, and super cute.",1
1,The problem with this product is that mine didn't come with the small rod to connect it to the watch so it's useless,0
3,The watch looks really nice but it seems the leather strap quality isn't that great. The strap may tear if not used carefully.,0
5,"Love this sweater, fits great, soft and cozy!",1
5,Beautiful colors. Flows nicely over body. Soft and substantial material. Dress for many occasions.,1
1,"I bought two of these, the latches didn‚Äôt work on either, the finish rubbed off with my fingers just taking it out of the package. I wasn‚Äôt even able to try wearing either because of how badly they were made.",0
1,"I should have listen to the reviews, the battery dead fast",0
5,"This is the second of the two shirts that  I have ordered and it fits PERFECT!! I used the rule of ordering one size down when going with British surplus items and found out it was better to go two on this item. This order was for a large due to the fact that the XL that I ordered was a bit long in the sleeves and swallowed the rest of me hole. I am not a small guy by any means I am 5'11&#34; 250 lbs with a 19 inch neck, 52 inch chest  and 22 inches across the shoulders and a 40 inch waist the large is by far an excellent fit still loose in all the right places and the sleeves are the proper length for a normal human being. The Multi-cam is a perfect match to my Propper and  Tru-Spec pants and gear.  And now the quality Wow  is all I can say after shopping all the other will known and trusted brands and being very turned off by the price or the fit and finish of the seams, this Shirt Hits all the marks in the highest order great materials excellent stitching and a price I can truly live with. You cannot go wrong by choosing this Multi- cam battle shirt  the padding is a very nice touch as well in all the right places where your armor and contact points are.",1
5,exactly what i was looking for,1
3,"I loved the look of them and they would be very cozy, but they didn‚Äôt fit my foot correctly. I tried two sizes. The molded rubber base hit my toes in the wrong spot. Gave them to my mother who loves them because they fit her perfectly.",0
3,It was a really big and really long. I would recommend getting it tailored. Still the colors are beautiful and match the photo.,0
2,I ordered two of these necklaces to give as gifts and had to repair a broken link on one of them.,0
4,The fit pf the hat is a bit large. More suitable for a toddler. Same with the gloves. Good material and well made though!,1
5,Great value.  Capri looks awesome.,1
5,"Perfect fit, good quality",1
5,I love this jacket! So comfy.,1
5,Excelente cartera,1
1,"I probably should have returned it because it broke after a week of wear. It was a birthday gift for my husband though and he just loved the style and decor so much, so I just ordered a second one without making a big deal out of it. But be careful if you order one because they are not strong. My first one wound up in the trash.",0
4,"I like the bigger baggy fit I find in mens pants, and they are comfy, not too hot.",1
5,"This facemask is exactly what my husband wanted! It is lightweight and the fabric stretches so it can be adjusted exactly where you want it to be. Have ordered more for gifts and one for myself. Plus, with needing to wear masks, this doubles as a mask and a warm face covering!",1
1,"I bought three of these bags to use as Christmas ‚Äústockings‚Äù for my daughters and sister because I loved the slogan on them, but sadly they are super cheap and flimsy and look like something you‚Äôd pay .99 cents for at the grocery store. I was very disappointed, but elected to keep and use them because it was too close to Christmas to make adjustments.",0
1,The material was horrible felt awful couldn‚Äôt wear for sure,0
5,Great quality,1
1,"It is cute, fits well, and the girls say it is comfortable. But with only one week of light use, the soles started to come apart. Not worth the money.",0
1,"These boots look good, and I was excited initially. However, the toes deformed almost immediately (each now has one or more pronounced creases that cannot be fixed). Shortly after that (days), the rubber tread began to detach from the wooden soles. I had to re-glue them within the first month.<br /><br />Additionally, the boots are hard to put on (I thought they would break in, but even though the boots are slightly large for my feet, they require a Herculean effort to pull on, and I have fairly average sized calves). Once you do get them on, they are not comfortable - the wooden components look nice, but if you have to wear them for a few hours or a few hundred yards, you will regret it. All problems combined - pretty disappointing.",0
1,Yo soy m√©dium y me quedo como un large no me gusta como me quedan . Y lo triste es que no lo puedo devolver üò≠,0
2,In the picture the wings look big. But they are small. Not too comfortable for my 11 years old girl to wear. Bad quality. My girl wore it for 2 minutes and a feather came off.,0
5,Just needs steam on it I love it,1
2,"one of the bars on this item arrived broken, it needs to be repaired.  We will use super glue, that will be easier than sending it back.<br /><br />It will work for organization, but too bad it was not made better.",0
2,"Took forever to arrive. Bows fell off after first wear. Cheap, cheap, cheap.",0
1,"Without submerging in water the stone has lost its color, it‚Äôs a fake, I need my monies back<br />I didn‚Äôt review sooner due to pandemic",0
4,"I hated showing my cleavage so this is perfect. Fits well, high neck. The material is as expected and no it is not as thin as others says.",1
5,"Super cute and professional looking, I think I might be a little to short for it, but its super cute and worth buying",1
5,very nice hat,1
5,I LOVE this!  Have it in 3 colors!,1
5,Nice,1
5,"Got this for a set of twins.  They have problems not only keeping the mask on but losing them.  This helps and quick to have all in one when at doctor's, stores, and just out and about.  Their moms really love this.",1
4,"The fit of the body suit is great I purchased an XL no tightness not too lose, the skirt attcched has a belt that's adjustable. Only issue which I did read on prior reviews is that the boob area is cut small and the strap that ties around your neck hits right in the middle of your boobs. I basically will be wearing boob tape so things stay in place and nothing slips out lol.",1
3,Size up and it‚Äôs a cheap material but if your looking for cheap-ish they this is your dress,0
5,"IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!  I really love this hand chain it is so beautiful on my hand it fits me perfect I have small hands, wrist and fingers and its really hard to find bracelets and hand chains that fit me with out getting them sized if its even possible but not this time this is the perfect hand chain for me because it is adjustable so you can wear it snug or loose if you have a larger wrist. I am very happy with this purchase it also came just in time for when I wanted to wear it, I got a lot of compliments on it , I wore it with my watch and other jewelry its so elegant yet casual you can dress it up or down. Thank you!! Thank you!! LOVE IT!!!",1
5,"I was so eager to post a review! I have a small narrow face and had another pair of aviators that always slipped off my nose and did not look right for my face shape. I saw these and took a chance. First, they arrived a day earlier than expected, came with a nice protective case and cleansing cloth and carrying sack! To top it off they fit snug and look great! I would definitely recommend and purchase another color. Love, love them!!",1
3,Not quality merchandise,0
1,The arm stitching was awful on this - it looked awkward and I ended up just donating this to Goodwill,0
2,These are totally adorable but won‚Äôt stay tied so you trip. I didn‚Äôt get past my bedroom door with them on.,0
5,"Great quality , highly recommend going up 1 size . Super cute and comfortable",1
3,Much thinner than the originals. Probably won‚Äôt buy again.,0
2,It's a physics equation. Sigh...,0
3,Looks a lot cheaper than the picture. It was stingy on seam lines when I got it and it's see through. But still cute,0
3,"Very nice little shoe charm.  A little smaller than what I expected, but the person we gave it to liked it very much.",0
1,The band with fastening pin & band opening are on the same band. Irregular item. Returning it.,0
3,Sorry it is long for me.,0
5,Mis reuniones y la predicaci√≥n,1
5,I love it so much,1
5,This unique necklace is stunning in person. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It can make any outfit look more put together and chic. Absolutely love it!<br />Wish it came in more colors and/or with different color stones inside.,1
3,They were not as anti-glare as I expected.  Purchased another similar pair to compare but I received two of the same pair.  Disappointing especially since I contacted the merchant and never heard a response.  Oh well!,0
3,"It is OK for the price and I expected for it to take time to arrive however, the pendant was attached backwards!  Easy fix; then it looks nice.",0
5,"The Jogal products run small.<br />Shirt is the bomb, many compliments for crazy design.",1
2,Cute bag but broke after 3rd use,0
5,"A $20 band that is as good a quality as the Fitbit official $150 band. It comes with the tools to add/remove links, and the buttons feel responsive like the official bands.",1
5,I wear a size medium and it fits loosely.,1
1,Way too tight at waistband. Way too long.,0
3,Good quality but doesn‚Äôt work with my boae,0
2,"Another reviewer had it right, more silver than diamonds.  I was under the impression that it had a larger diamond center when in fact it is a chip in a sea of silver... they are pretty, just not what I was expecting.  They should show the item against something to indicate size.",0
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money. Wore it for 3 days and went from rose gold to tarnished. Didn‚Äôt get it wet or anything.,0
1,"These boots were pretty cheap (in price) I bought just 1 pair to check how it feels. initially you will find the boots are pretty comfortable and they looked pretty well I have to admit it. The problem is just after 2 months of use, the base started breaking, the internal got broke on the heel and suddenly, a couple of weeks later the sole started to be detached, it got broken on so many parts that I preffered to send them to trash before trying to fix it. Very cheap in price, but very cheap materials also, Not Recommended at all (unless you need a pair of boots that lasts 3 months at best) ZERO STARS!!!",0
5,"I just got these today and I pulled them out of the package and fell in love with the feel of the fabric!  It feels so soft and yet silky too, and cool to the touch. I ordered them because I have been told and read how bamboo is supposed to sleep cooler and wick away moisture and being 51 and dealing with night sweats/hot flashes I am hoping it makes sleeping more comfortable.<br /><br /> As  far as sizing, I wear a 8 or 10 in jeans but wanted to make sure they weren't tight so I ordered a Large.  I am glad I did since the waist band is snug enough that I think a medium may have been too tight. I am only 5'1&#34; so of course they are too long, but I am used to that, I just pull them up higher and/or roll the waist band. the shirt is a high/low style with the back longer than the front, not sure why, but it doesn't bother me.  The only negative is that the top is very sheer, I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them in front of anyone besides my husband.<br /><br />Again I just recieved them today, but so far I am very happy with them.<br /><br />***update....it's now been a few weeks and I wear them EVERY night!  They are my favorites!  I washed them (NO fabric softner!!) and hung to dry and they were fine.  I  LOVE these pajamas!",1
5,It is exactly as I expected!!! Love the material and the way it fits!!!,1
4,"Let me first off say the sizing chart is pretty correct. I bought a medium and I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 160 pounds,  and it fits perfectly.<br /><br /> It is very reflective, though not as reflective as the reflectoes vests.  It is a nice gray color during the day. It is a rain jacket primarily as it is a plastic/vinyl material and will not breathe.  There is no mesh liner material or anything like that inside .  It has a  zipper pocket in the lower back And a large vent in the upper back. The cuffs are elastic and also have Velcro adjustments.  It uses the women‚Äôs configuration for a front zipper--minus1 star!<br /><br />I think it is perfect for motorcycle or scooter riding to maintain visibility to all traffic, and doubles as a rain jacket.... that‚Äôs what I use it for.",1
3,"Looks neat. Not exactly high quality. My last one started corroding and rusting just from skin contact after a couple of months. This one is a replacement, but it arrived with a dead battery.",0
1,My daughter loved the belts but one broke the first day she wore it. Disappointed,0
5,Worked out great. I‚Äôm small an purchased a small an it some what stretches,1
3,"Run really small, more a kids size.",0
3,"Love these, but they're too small to be harem pants for me, more like sweatpants. I ordered these because I thought mens clothing were supposed to run bigger than womens but I must be wrong. I'm a womens size 14/16 so I ordered a 1x, and they're too tight around my legs and waist. Luckily I'm able to make due with them.",0
5,My sons favorite shirt of all time,1
4,ok,1
5,This is one of the best cases that I have found. It lives up to its description. It's a great product,1
3,I order this shirt based on the sizing chart. I typically wear a US medium and given the chart info I ordered a XXL. It's too big. I'm returning and getting the XL. I'm 5'11&#34; and 180lbs.,0
5,"I got the Red and it's cute, cheaply made, Very thin but that was to be expected because of the price for that I'm still giving 5 stars üòç",1
2,Cute skirt but made for tiny people; not normal sized American women.  I knew it would not fit as soon as I unpacked it - it looked to be child-sized.,0
2,cheap,0
4,ok,1
5,all good,1
3,"Dress is as shown with ruching on the sides, not cute imo. Material is the cheap costume like material.",0
3,"Some fit very nice, others did not. I don't particularly like boy cut style underwear, I got 4, they will work for my workouts though. One of the underwear did rip when I tested the stretchiness, no good.",0
1,Extremely disappointed & unsatisfied!! The initial earrings are MUCH SMALLER than what the picture shows.  Very DECEIVING pictures!!!  Will not by again.,0
1,[[VIDEOID:d22ef45de6a2c0aeb312f62b01480d73]] It was very wrinkly out of the bag and the material was paper mache like. Overall it has a very cheap look to it. I brought it to wear to a funeral but I don‚Äôt think it would be proper attire at all :(,0
5,This is a really cute tote. My 11 yr old was super excited to use this as a way to hold her beads for bracelet making and take them to school. I actually wanted it for myself because it‚Äôs really cute and durable and holds a nice amount of stuff. Perfect beach bag or even a purse.,1
4,Not exactly as pictured but still pretty and worked for the event I needed it for,1
5,This umbrella looks good and has held up well over the last year+. Love the change in angle as the sun moves across the sky.,1
1,"I purchased the earrings for my wife, she wore them for 2 weeks. She had them on in the morning and later in the day she realized one of the earrings was missing!! so much for twist back for a more security. i do not recommend these earnings, Amazon customer support wont help out with my issue! Had me contact manufacture and i am yet to hear back.",0
5,Very shiny good quality,1
2,Crap,0
5,I wear these at work. They are worn inside my Crocs and take a beating as I walk and stand in one place for almost 10 hours a day. This is my first week wearing them. Time will tell how long they hold up. So far so good.üòä,1
2,‚òπÔ∏è<br />Proportionally not a good fit!,0
5,"This is exactly as described.  I purchased the two pack.  fits me and my wife, lightweight, and fashionable (I guess) if a reflective belt can be fashionable, LOl....",1
4,"Used these a while back for a winter solstice get together ritual. They are way more fangy than i thought but hey, it worked üòâ",1
2,"It says US size XS. When I got them the tag says US XS 27. 27 is medium, xsmall is 23 or 24. I need 23 or 24.",0
2,"Product was smaller than expected, bracelet was very small and it was too thick. I actually gave it away to a younger coworker.",0
1,Broke immediately!,0
5,Cool shades üòé for my 3 year old. He loves them,1
2,"I wanted to love this shirt.  I bought the 2Xl because I wanted a thin, baggy shirt like the one in the picture.  Unfortunately, the mannequin in the image must be tiny.  When I received the shirt, it was thin, the neck was nicely scooped, but it was one of the smallest 2XL's I've ever purchased.  The 2XL fits like a generous Medium.  Definitely not ""flowy"".  It is constructed well and the fabric feels great, so I won't say it was a complete waste - just not the shirt that is described.",0
1,False advertising. This shirt is NOT 100% cotton. As soon as I took it out of the bag and felt the material I knew it wasn‚Äôt cotton. Feels like plastic. I didn‚Äôt even try it on.  The tag inside the shirt says 100% polyester.,0
2,Pattern weird.  I bought as a gift. Not sure if recipient will like or not.,0
4,Beautiful earring I gave them 4 stars because the post is very thin and bends easily. You have to be careful how you store them so the post doesn't bend.,1
3,"Dress is cute, but a little cheap. Also runs a bit small. I would size up.",0
2,At first I loved the look of it. It was supposed to be for my 6 year old for her birthday BUT it was extremely small like for a toddler. I contemplated just giving it to my 2 year old niece but it was so see through. I returned it and got my money back,0
1,"The chain  on these were so short like a kids chain, an before I even start to wear it was changin colour",0
2,The chain faded very quickly and turned like a dark brown.,0
1,The only reason it got one star is because I couldn't give it zero. It's a total piece of garbage. I had it for a week & the band broke where the pin connects to the watch. DO NOT BUY,0
2,Beautiful dress I ordered it for my brother graduation wasn't able to wear it because it is extremely small I am a 3X I ordered 4x for extra room I'm going to turn it into a maxi skirt dress is an amazing idea has pockets that's why it gets the two stars,0
3,All Chinese leather is inferior to European Indian and Mexican products,0
2,"Giving this a 2 star rating because it is very cute and the fabric is nice, the shipping was a lot faster than expected, but it is way to short in the torso and there is no support for the girls. As far as the shortness goes, I'm 5'1&#34; and I got the XL and it was still to short and because of the it also affected (what littlethere is) the support for the girls. So basically is your very tiny, short, and not so well endowed in the chest, it would probably fit you.",0
5,"The best USA jersey to come out in the last few years. The white design is comfortable and looks vintage. The crest is a little bit large, but sits above the chest muscle and does not get in the way. I wear this shirt casually and also when I play soccer. It is a versatile shirt that allows my body to not overheat and sweat too much. I love it, I love the quality, and I love the way it matches with any other outfit you might be wearing. Not too mention the this is the Centennial Shirt! Talk about celebrating in style.",1
3,I am normally a size 12 and found the large size option and raunched waist excentuated the waist line. I liked the dress Color/pattern and fabric weight but overall did not fit well so I returned.,0
5,Quite lovely and they didn‚Äôt shed or break like real feather wings,1
5,Great pullover great price,1
2,"The front is way too &#34;low rise.&#34; That is, the waist band and draw strings are like literally on your junk. Not up at your normal waist line like a regular speedo. Looks good in the photo, of course, but not very functional to actually wear.",0
5,"Came on time! Look as pictured! Thicker fabric, great quality! Would definitely buy again for a bachelorette party!",1
2,Material way to thin‚Ä¶ could see every bump or bulge‚Ä¶.,0
2,"They seems nice, they're just huge.",0
5,Totally in love with this dress. So sorry I didn't take pictures when I wore it. It is long (floor-length) which I love. The material is a jersey type-stretch material. Wish they had more colors.,1
3,"Comfortable, however the fabric started to pill after wearing them twice.",0
5,Love it fits perfectly,1
1,The picture on the hoodie was faded more than what the photo shows,0
2,ugly in person,0
5,Well made and good quality. Just to small for my use.,1
5,I love Birkenstock that is the only thing I can wear at work that releases my heel pain.,1
1,Instead of socks I got Draw string bags!,0
3,Not enough support any where.,0
1,Poorly made.<br />They fell apart bf I could even wear them.<br />The red bows fell off apparently they were glued on because there is glue residue where the bows should be.,0
1,Broke the first time I used it. Very cheaply made/,0
2,My daughter dropped this from less than 1ft above the ground and the big magenta rhinestones popped out. Broken:(,0
3,I love my romper! I didn't know the back was totally out.I wish there had been a picture showing the back of it . I had to improvise since I can't go without a bra,0
5,Very nice. Soft and comfy.,1
1,Actual Mask does not look like mask featured.  Mask is simplistic and not like the one pictured.,0
4,Perfect fit! Good colors!,1
5,Bras fit perfect.  High quality.,1
3,"It's a great mask, but after about a month the ear bands stretchy bands snapped and so it is starting to fit less and less",0
3,"Loved the bag when it first arrived, but after only 3 months of &#34;normal&#34; use (everyday to work bag, I carry a 15&#34; laptop computer and 2-3 thick files) the shoulder strap clips are broken.  The bag will not sit upright, no matter how I arrange the items. Otherwise, material is holding up well no &#34;wear marks&#34; and easily wipes clean with damp cloth.",0
3,Expected better from the reviews. The weight is decent but looked already somewhat worn right out of the package.,0
1,These shirts are NOT THE SAME AS THE FIRST ONE I ORDERED!  Used ‚ÄúBuy it Again‚Äù option. The shirts are all different styles and COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FABRICS AND MANUFACTURERS!!!  BAD SELLERS.,0
1,"I ordered this for my daughter‚Äôs dance costume.  The headband is cute with the little ears. The issue I have is with the tail. It came in a sealed bag but it appeared dirty and matted - as if someone had worn and returned it. Hopefully this will not be noticeable from the audience‚Äôs perspective. Recognizing that it is generally for a child‚Äôs dress-up toy, I don‚Äôt think it is worth the amount paid.",0
5,These are perfect!  Receive lots of compliments anytime I wear. What a fantastic deal. Great on trend purchase<br />Would recommend to anyone.,1
1,"I ordered the xlg I‚Äôm the black dress with white collar. It is literally like a small/medium. Very misrepresented otherwise it‚Äôs cute, but thin material. The entire dress fits into a sandwich size ziplock",0
1,"Poor quality and sizing. The stitching was coming apart within 24 hours, after only a few hours or wear. The size 4-6x isn't correct. The dress was snug on my 5t toddler. Pick another one",0
5,"Loved the colour, the fabric, so comfy. Would buy again.",1
1,"Horrible fit, thin material, wrinkled seams, terrible waistband. I do not recommend these.",0
5,This is so soft.  I look silly in it but I do not care.  Memory foam is great stuff.  Very comfortable pillow for travel!,1
4,They broke the first time I wore them.,1
5,It‚Äôs a bit large on me but I don‚Äôt mind I still love this shirt.,1
5,Spot on just as pictured,1
1,"I really tried to like these socks. I read that they mostly fit true to size and I did not find that to be true at all. I wear a size 7 women's shoe and the socks I got were way too big and slipped off my feet easily. I felt strange about returning socks, but I should have. They are way too big.",0
1,Product is what the price suggests. Husband could not use it.,0
1,"Not flattering, thin, and too big",0
1,It was cheap material and the sleeves were too short...,0
2,"I loved the print - love the length. However the underwire - on both the supposed d and dd sizes was small. I am not HUGE breasted but do wear a d cup - it was flattering and cute so my best friend also purchased one. We both wore them on vacation and discovered the underwire moved weird and hurt. She gave hers to me because of the underwire issue, thinking it was just maybe too small (since she had the bigger bust size) - but it isn't. It's the same fit with both sizes. And it HURTS.<br />In fact, I didn't like it so much that I left it on vacation. Four Thumbs down for hurting the boobs.",0
1,These were a waste of $. Suiser to be a nice color & were horrible. Dob‚Äôt Mother,0
5,Very good price,1
2,"This is meant for petite women.  I'm a new momma.  I have a momma bust and a momma waist.  Naturally, I am a size bigger than i was before I had my child, so I ordered an XL, reading the measurements.  The fabric is SUPER SOFT, for starters and made quite nicely. It just hugs the hips and the girls.  You could totally tell when you're &#34;cold&#34; and you can see the &#34;momma chub&#34; and the outline of the belly button when wearing it.  Cute shirt though, just not for my body type.",0
5,"love my sandals, feel good, leather works great, no problems with them, happy with the product",1
5,This is a HIGH-quality synthetic stone with lots of fire and sparkle. Stones appear to be absolutely genuine diamonds. Silver finished to a high polish makes ring look very lux. Perfect width for a statement piece. I love this ring!,1
2,They fit as expected but they feel gross. I workout and have lost of workout clothes these are for funky not good for working out whatsoever.,0
5,very pleased,1
1,Bought this bra to wear under a dirndl dress for an Oktoberfest party. I got a size up and it's a bit snug so I would suggest two sizes up and also a size or two bigger around. (Comes with extension) The bra will do what I need it to do but the reason I gave it one star is because the metal on the strap was rusted and stained the bra on both straps! I wonder how much moisture got to it before I got it. I'm so disappointed. I was looking forward to this bra after all the good reviews from busty women like myself.,0
3,Ok for that price..,0
3,Got some wrinkles I can‚Äôt iron out,0
5,This is a unique and sweet little jacket!,1
1,this band is nothing like the picture! its actually pink not tan or gray the bees and lions look like blobs! its definitely getting returned!!,0
5,"I‚Äôve not used this hat as of yet as it is early October. However, it is a knit hat with cloth lining, so it seems likely to be warm. The colors are absolutely beautiful. I look forward to using it this soon coming winter. I will update as to its warmth in a few weeks‚Äô time.",1
2,Fabric feels like a paint canvas,0
4,fits a little large. comes vacuum sealed so its a little matted upon arrival. one that did not come vacuum sealed looks better,1
1,The plastic is really sharp. Charm is really little. Was very disappointed..,0
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money This item is so cheap,0
1,I opened the bag and felt the material and didn't even take it out of the bag-it felt like it was going to come apart! it went back!,0
3,"This dress had so much potential!  The detail on the hem looked adorable online and this skater style always looks cute in my daughter. Well, this dress is the exception. The material is, well, weird. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but it feels weird. Not cottony, not exactly polyester either. On top of that the fit was off. Not super flattering; made a very thin girl look a little thick in the waist. Anyway, cute for the money but not the perfect dress.",0
4,"nice dress, nice material, beautiful colors",1
1,"You get what you pay for I guess.  Its so cheap and crappy, don't waste your money.  Seriously.",0
1,Cheap. Watch got caught on my pocket getting my keys out and the locking mechanism that attaches to the watch face snapped. Had it for less than a week when it broke.,0
5,This was a really great value/purchase,1
5,"very good, I like it.",1
1,This product was very cheaply made!,0
3,Overall Bracelet looks ok but string is coming apart after two days of wearing,0
5,made well,1
5,"Comfy and supportive with or without the pads. Easy to get on, you don't need to be a double jointed contortionist.",1
1,Broke during installation. Mounting pins are way too delicate.  They should be at least twice as durable.  Cannot believe manufacturing folks that test these actually did test them.  Total rip-off.,0
3,Very see through.,0
5,"So cute in person. Color has a slight lavender hue, which I love. Receive many compliments on this band.",1
3,"lenses came out on first wear popped right back in but, get a the job done",0
1,Super pretty but makes wars green,0
2,The zipper is kind of cheap on it. I don't think it will last very long,0
5,"This is a gorgeous top. I‚Äôm a 34B, 110 pounds and bought the 4/6 size. It fits great, but I need nipple covers under.",1
5,"I wish it was just a bit larger, but it works.",1
3,"I like that they are adjustable to your disired coverage. Would have gave 5 stars, but they run small. Coverage in booty is full and won‚Äôt creep.",0
2,"Size is great and comfy. But it isn't the item in the listing.  It says Anderson,  not Sanderson.",0
4,normal,1
1,"These are at least a FULL SIZE TOO SMALL.  In addition, there are several loose and broken threads in the stitching.",0
5,Gift,1
5,Nice. V too deep.,1
1,I loved the look when it came but 3 weeks later my arm got little blisters from allergies because the coating came off. It's not stainless steel!,0
5,Beautifil,1
1,Not same item in picture. Poor quality. Do not buy. Difficult communication when trying to return. Do not waste your time. Poorly stitched and uneven.,0
5,Well made and sized just right for my 5 and 6 year old boys. They are so very fussy about masks ‚Äî never like the way they fit and feel. But these they don‚Äôt complain about at all. Seemingly more comfortable and easy to use. An added plus in this year‚Äôs summer heat is that you can also wet them to help the kids stay cooler as well!,1
5,This material is soft and nice!!! Love Love the color!!!,1
5,Bought this for my father-in-law and he LOVES IT!  Has been wearing it all winter and getting tons of compliments on it.,1
5,"Wore in Iceland hiking in February with thin thermals, not only comfortable but amazing wind resistance. I was toasty warm in 30 degree weather. Thin and easy to move in.",1
5,"Very handsome, my exec boyfriend likes it.",1
5,Just the perfect product for me.,1
2,"The lenses are great in the glasses, but the frames are gas station cheap. Mine cracked early on when I bought them from nothing but putting them on and taking them off. Fast forward several months and they are now in 2 separate pieces despite careful handling. The frame just can‚Äôt hold up to daily use, and for the price they should be able to.<br /><br />I‚Äôve owned the same pair of eye glasses for 6-7 years now, it‚Äôs not an issue of me being hard on glasses, they are just very poorly made frames.<br />If their lifespan of daily use is less than a year, they should reflect that in the price.",0
1,"I did NOT order Sunflowers, ever.",0
3,"DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER. Follow washing directions - delicate or hand wash, line dry. Good news is, they dry fast.",0
5,Very nice.  Looks like it cost more than it did.,1
2,"I bought two packs of these to accommodate our family of four. Upon opening the first pack, one of the hats was stained as you can see in the picture. Also I don‚Äôt think I would use the term plush to describe these, as the red material is a very thin felt. The white trim and pom aren‚Äôt horrible but I would say you could probably find similar quality at the dollar store, for probably a cheaper price. The icing on the cake for me was the tag inside said not to wash these, but to dry clean lol!",0
5,My mom loved it!,1
1,"Poor Quality, look very very cheap. Hoping to return not easy to get out to return",0
1,For a 2x this runs pretty small and it very thin t-shirt material. It's cute tho,0
5,"love, love,love it, looks expensive",1
1,Size on this blouse was soooo small.  Looking to give to someone who it might fit.  Too much trouble to return.  Will never use this company again . Why did you even use them in the first place.  You knew sizing was questionable.  !,0
4,Great size for a trip to dance lessons,1
5,Great product!,1
3,Nice piece thanks,0
1,"Wouldn't recommend. Cheap material, not a good quality item... the size adjustment in the back is elastic and slips back no matter how many times you fit it to your head, the shape of the actual hat I received is also kind of odd, not really suited for use in a human head, tbh. I purchased it last minute for an amusement park trip, and I ended up not even using it because it was too annoying/ill-fitting",0
2,looked too cheap,0
1,Cheap. Sizing off.,0
5,"I purchased this key chain as a gift for our PTA president. It was perfect. The saying descried her and all of her efforts over her two year term. The size of the key chain was a bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is very nice. It came packaged in plastic, inside of a velvet drawstring bag - perfect for gift-giving.",1
1,"Horrible quality! Came with no belt/tie as pictured and promised in product description. Cannot wear and strongly recommend others don‚Äôt order, either!",0
1,These pants are like as thin as a plastic bag,0
3,"Loved the quality, but the size too small! Returned a d did not get larger size because you do not make larger size.",0
1,I‚Äôm  skinny and I order a medium couldn‚Äôt even get my foot through the leg hole DO NOT BUY!!! And they ripped!!!!!!  Those reviews are probably fake because these pants are trash !!  Do not buy do not buy do not buy do not buy !!!!!!! Very cheap material  !!!!,0
5,Love it! Very cool.,1
1,Small cut not American sizing,0
5,Love it worked great,1
2,"I do not like that this isn‚Äôt sold as a pair. It isn‚Äôt really very good looking and there is only 1. Overall hard pass. Craftsmanship is very good so if you like it, buy 2 and it‚Äôs fine.",0
2,very tight thought it was going to be a little stretchy but not at all,0
1,It was very flimsy...not worth the price and not the usual Nike standard,0
2,"Very weird cut to this.  Awkward seem placement causes it to bunch up at upper arm.  Roomy through body (as expected) but forarms very tight.  Just a really strange shape to the garment.  Also, from the picture I expected more of a knit sweater, but it's just made from a thin cotton fabric.  I contacted seller to return it, but they just gave me a refund and said to keep it, so customer service was great (which earned them the second star!)  I will probably keep and wear this when all my other clothes are dirty and I need to do laundry. :P",0
1,Smelled like spray paint and tough to breath while wearing,0
2,A little too big.,0
4,"Good looking dress for work but it's smaller,I normally wear a small but this one it's a little tight, maybe order a bigger size",1
5,I bought this top from Nordstrom Rack less than half the price here.  I love it and it is one of my favs from Free People.,1
5,"Does a fast, convenient job with little mess. Still using for any other job, cleaned a lot of my jewelry (very little it doesn't do). Leaves a high grade polished job behind.",1
5,"Perfect fit, classy and comfortable.  Nice business dress and it‚Äôs pretty",1
1,Crap all together,0
5,Great fit! True to size,1
1,"Way I could give a 0, I corer these it says 12 and I only got 6! Returning ASAP",0
3,They are not this hot/fushia pink in person they are more like a bubblegum pink a little disappointed abt tht.,0
4,Cool √≠tem thanks,1
4,Good.,1
3,It was a little too much for me. I snipped off the two shortest rows and it was much better.,0
5,Perfect size purse for my 4 year old. She loves it!,1
5,"These are great! I am an Emergency department RN and constantly on my feet. Typically I purchase new ""work"" shoes every 3 months due to the wear and tear I put on them. I have only worn them a few times so far, but I can tell a big difference in support from my previous pair of shoes. They are very comfortable and I love the design. I have gotten so many complements on them just in the few short days I have owned them!!",1
5,"Warm and comfy, long enough to cover my behind so I can wear with leggings.",1
5,Sooooo Love this ! I can't believe how light it is. Which is great because anyone who travels internationally knows they charge over a certain weight !! Great amount of space to! I am ecstatic and last but not least .... I specifically chose this color because after going to Ireland last year and struggling to find my luggage in a sea of black that all look alike this color will make my life so much easier when we go to Italy in September ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
3,The dress is more of a rose gold as others stated in their reviews. The fit was ok. The dress gives so it was ok. The split is pretty high in the front. It was an ok value for the price.,0
1,Way way small. Disappointing,0
4,"Skort is both comfortable and complimentary with a modern, youthful flair to it.",1
1,"So I thought this was super cute to give to my fianc√© for Christmas. Not only does he collect watches, but he‚Äôs a photographer. Win win situation right? Wrong. What I got in the mail was a pair of hi fi headphones. How are headphones anywhere CLOSE to this product. Now when I try to reorder, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcurrently unavailable‚Äù. Very disappointed.",0
3,Order up! Being busty I didn‚Äôt stand a chance in this ! And I recommend finding another belt for the ppl who are a little bigger,0
4,Had a darker mark on the part with the words because of the metal. Really cute though and a great price!,1
3,I can't use these because I think they are made for little kids shoes (way too small).,0
5,"Perfect fit and beautiful colors, I have been using for over 3 months without taking it off and it looks brand new, plus on the second day of wearing it I started to notice less pains, so not only it is beautiful jewelry but it works very well, I recommend it.",1
2,"* The ear loops are too short, and not adjustable at all. It's painful to wear for any length of time.<br />* The metal piece that's supposed to help fit the mask around the nose is loose inside the mask. I had to work it up into place and then add a few stitches to keep it there.",0
1,The heels are weak and will make your feet slide,0
4,"Sons doesnt mind it much, just too big for him yet",1
4,Gift for child. Cute,1
2,Cute outfit but socks keep rolling down and wings broke first time tried to put them on. Would not recommend.,0
1,No instructions but not hard to figure out some would have been nice. But either way they do not work for a 3 year old.,0
5,Fit as expected. Love the shirt,1
3,The item fits perfectly unfortunately I noticed there was dent in the surface where the arch area. This was due to packing issue. See attached picture.,0
5,Beautiful,1
5,A little bit bigger but I like my hoodies bigger. Could have probably gotten a size smaller but it's ok.,1
5,"Received my earrings a few days ago, and I LOVE THEM! So happy with this purchase.",1
5,"SO cute and comfortable! My new favorite winter shirt hands down. Made very nicely, great woman's cut, and pretty colors too.",1
5,"I'm 5'6, 105 lbs and this was super perfect and really pretty! It's very stretchy, but is also thick material so there is no see through what so ever. The pants are NOT full length. I really liked the bright blue color. It pulls out my tan well. The small fit perfectly! I will attach a photo as well.",1
1,"My earrings fell apart!!! Not just the silver pair, but the gold too!!! I‚Äôm livid!!",0
3,It fit a lot smaller than expected,0
1,Not durable.,0
5,"What a great idea! When I first saw &#34;silicone wedding rings,&#34; I didn't know what to think. Why would anyone want them? After reading the description, I got it. Being an avid outdoors-everything person for most of my life (landscaping/swimming/hiking) this would have been very nice to have. I never liked taking my rings off, so was at my jewelers a lot getting them repaired & cleaned up. I just couldn't stand the feeling of &#34;something missing.&#34; And something important!<br /><br />My husband is a contractor. He, also, doesn't like having his ring off, but with his work, where safety is involved, he has no choice. And, unlike me, he'd rather not wear it for a while than have to continuously take it in for tune-ups. So, he's a big fan!",1
5,Love this shirt.  It is very soft and fits great.  It is slimming to me.  I have ordered several more in different colors since this first one.,1
3,"Very cute ""T"". I ordered my normal size, a little too snug and on the thin side. I was not comfortable with the size and returned it.",0
2,These run small. They are shipped from China so if you go to return them they will offer only a certain percent of your money back to keep them. If I had known this I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered them. I‚Äôve run into this trap before.,0
3,"Just ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. Just an easy to wear dress that doesn‚Äôt look too cheap.",0
5,"Very good quality, good product, fit perfect.",1
3,"Brim width is good - wide enough to block the sun but not obstruct your vision. Size chart is accurate. The hat would work best in cool to moderate temperatures.  The top is not adequately vented and is uncomfortably hot at 90+ degrees.  Overall it will be a good 2 season hat, but I won't be able to use it during the summer.",0
2,"I received this dress today and was very impressed with the quality, however, when I unzipped to try the dress on, it had obviously either been worn or tried on and returned as it is covered with make-up and deodorant on the inside.... I have never had this happen when ordering.  Super disappointed as it was purchased to wear to an event this weekend and have no time to receive a replacement.",0
5,I love! Great buy!,1
5,Fit nice,1
1,Awkward is all I can say.,0
2,When I got it the beads were packed on to the string so there wasn‚Äôt ready comfortable to have,0
5,Fit great true to size.  Good quality!,1
4,The frame is not very well made and they are very narrow. They are defiantly made for a small head.,1
5,Love it,1
1,rubbish...turns black after 3 days when wet. thought it was a beach jewelry...dry weather beach I guess.,0
1,Flimsy cheap and too small,0
5,Love these. Wanted something to keep me warm under other clothes and they do that. I will order more after the holiday rush. They are very comfortable. The colors are nice too.,1
4,Love them!! They are super cute and soft. The button fell off of one of them when they were delivered but luckily I sewed it back on and you can't even tell! Overall really nice boot toppers.,1
1,Epic fail. See thru. Fits odd. Not for plus size women. Returned,0
5,These are the most beautiful hoops! I love the way they catch the light. They are beautiful and not too big.,1
5,Great little wallet. Extremely useful while travelling. Drivers Licence ID also well designed.. RFID blocking provides security. Slips easily into purse pocket,1
4,It‚Äôs pretty. It would be nice if the neck hole is bigger. It‚Äôs a struggle to put it in.,1
5,Perfect for plus size girls with big heads. Clear and sturdy,1
5,I gave this as a birthday gift and she loved it.,1
5,I use this for my son's diaper bag and it works perfect I love all the pockets it has and the different options to carry the bag,1
3,Same as their d-rings described as ‚Äúsilvery‚Äù but it‚Äôs nickel plated‚Ä¶. Pictures make it look much darker (like black chrome or gun metal)<br />It definitely is nickel plated,0
3,"The jeans were cute; however, after washing and drying, they were extremely wrinkled and needed to be ironed, unlike most jeans!",0
5,"I'm 5'5 and a half. 168lbs medium build. Size 12 for pants but,  very busty 38DD so I usually wear a 14/XL or XXL on top.  I like to be comfortable in my clothes and so took a chance and ordered the XXL with this dress. It fit perfect!!!  The buttons don't look like they are coming undone on top. The dress hangs perfectly when on. The fabric is stretchy on top. The dress looks fitted on top and not tight at all.  I have average arms and the sleeves are comfy. Not tight. The dress has the right amount of flare. I'm not bottom heavy. I got this dress to wear at a gala and it's perfect. Happy with my purchase.!!!",1
3,"I ended up getting green, blue, purple, pink, black and yellow - the picture even though it says there are 6 tongue rings, is misleading. Other reviews say they received the clear one and I was hoping for that one most of all, but never received it.<br />As that was a selling point, I can't say I was completely satisfied with this order.",0
3,"As everyone has said, the mask is INSANELY small but a size up and he would have been swimming in the rest of the suit. Kid was fine not wearing the mask but it was disappointing.",0
1,"Need photo corrected, currently shows a Bluetooth shower speaker",0
4,Love it. But did not fit the way I thought it would,1
5,So soft. Took a long time to get here,1
3,this doesn't last long.,0
4,I normally wear XL so based on other reviews I ordered XXXL and it fit my daughter who wears a womens medium. They are super cute so I gave it 4 stars.,1
3,"Very comfortable fabric, the waist is nice and high, especially on a short torso (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and weigh 135, ordered a small and they aren‚Äôt tight or snug in waist very comfortable) I‚Äôve worn them once and work in a fitness club, a lot of movement and bending  and no rolling of the waist. The fabric is thick enough, ‚Äúsquat proof‚Äù but not restrictive. The style is not compression,and not overly supportive but they don‚Äôt advertise it to be, so just a heads up, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. I may try the x-small just to see the difference.",0
1,Item arrived with a broken mirror. Needed to do a return.,0
5,Goes well with black dress.,1
3,It is a beautiful pendent it just was to small  I did returned it.,0
4,Soft & very comfortable,1
5,"I will wear it as a necklace or put it to hang on my review mirror. At this price I may get another for my car. The other colors besides purple are pretty too and I definitely want the blue one some time. Of note: the ribbon is pretty, it also has cording and a metal clasp to open and close it.",1
1,Ordered 9-10yo size for my son who is actually 9 years old. The shirts were too small for my son and instead fit my much smaller nephew who is 6 and normally wears a 6/7 in shirts.,0
4,nice hat.,1
4,I really lived these leggings! Good fit and stomach control! It is good for running and exercising just not entirely squat proof but I still love them!,1
5,I bought this hat for my 3 month-old daughter. It was a little bit big on her but that's okay because I really liked the quality of the hat. It's soft and warm and overall just great!!,1
5,"The gloves are an amazing value. I have thick hands and a 9-1/2"" wrist. The XL gloves fit very comfortably and are made better than gloves I have spent three times as much for.",1
5,Loved these...just what I needed to transport hot food...very sturdy!!,1
5,So pretty!,1
2,Product looks good but the magnet was weak. Hard to keep on during the day.,0
3,"The band isn't soft enough, it gave me a rash.",0
2,Picture look good but it not useful.,0
3,This coat was supposed to be a size XL 18-20 but I'm pretty sure it was a size 12-14.  Cute coat but I had to send it back since it was too small for my eleven-year-old son.,0
3,I gave 3 stars for softness and they seem to be holding up fine through the wash. The top is cute and fits great the bottoms are too long and very unflattering. You‚Äôre only sleeping in them right? Not for me. Only 3 stars because of sloppy bottoms. Purchased the medium,0
3,The stripes down the back seam aren't any where close to matching.,0
2,I bought these and the H:oter Sportline Head Band and much prefer the latter though they cost more.  These work but begin to loose their shape after a few washings.  They are lighter weight and may be cooler and are significantly less expensive and may be preferred by some.  It is a matter of taste.,0
2,"The style is cute, but there's no way these are real leather - they're pleather. In addition, while I realize the hardware isn't real silver (nor should they be), they have this finicky varnish that I know will wear off in no time.",0
5,"It was a gift for someone really special to me, from what she said it seemed it was to her liking.",1
2,I was hoping this would fit nicely to give me protection when in a Covid patient room. They don‚Äôt work well with an N 95 mask. There was a downward pressure/pull on my eyes. Maybe because I wear contacts this made it extremely uncomfortable. They fog up easily but that was remedied using anti-fog solution.<br />Luckily I wear these at most 1.5 hours. My hats off to emergency and ICU room staff who wear these all day!!,0
1,Terrible dress! Barely held together at the seams. Strings coming out of it everywhere. Would fall apart just by looking at it too hard. Material is paper thin and transparent. Returned.,0
5,Awesome slippers! My friend really enjoys them! Very comfortable!,1
4,"The material is slightly stretchy & surprisingly a little thicker than what I thought it would be.  Specially the cardigan, so get ready to sweat a little under your arms. All in all it looks great & fits well",1
1,"All pairs broke in 3 days. Super-cheap. Look ok, but very poor construction. Even the matte finish was rubbing off shortly before the frames all broke in the same place.....top right of the lens.",0
5,Perfecto,1
1,Don‚Äôt buy,0
4,It is cute but rather small for an XL,1
5,Nice color. Great fit. Comfortable,1
3,"Not true to color advertised.  Grey is very dark; not light, as pictured.",0
4,The pants are super comfortable and soft.  The fit is true to size.  I love the print.  I would give 5 stars except that they are slightly transparent in the butt when I bend over.,1
1,It looks as though it has been washed again and again.  Very poor quality.,0
5,"I like this because it came with so many styles, colors and different piercings. Some of the stuff is goofy looking but it's alot more good stuff than bad so it's well worth the money.",1
3,"These are just okay. The length is good, the color is pretty, although not same color as photo. They do not fit well. Very tight waist that doesn‚Äôt stretch much at all. I have found others that are way better fitting",0
3,its nice but the straps are falling off and i always have to stitch them up but its big enough to fit all my school stuff,0
3,"First when I received the mask it was the wrong color, I ordered the gray and black instead I got the gray and dark blue. Either way I ended up wearing, although its a lot easier to breath through VS your regular mask given out by the public, this mask tends to rub on your lips alot. If your like me and use chapstick frequently it dries it out fast. And also leaves the cloth on your lips a bit wet from saliva.<br /><br />Besides that its very easy to put on, can hang on the neck when your eating or drinking, and looks 100x better.",0
1,Quality of the sewing on the shirt is low. It is already coming undone in the left side,0
5,A great product at a great price!,1
4,"pretty dress, fits well, overall pleased",1
1,Size way off,0
3,"Way too small, I re-ordered a size larger, hope they fit.",0
5,Great gift for my husband. Material is soft and fit as expected.,1
1,"This is made of a cheap shiny material.  It also hangs loosely on my legs (I'm small, 90lbs).  The length barely fits me.  I'm 5'2, so it's not like I'm tall either!  So yeah, don't bother unless you are about my height and weigh 40lbs more.. oh and you don't mind thin shiny cheap material.  It feels like a halloween costume, the cheap kind you can buy at a drugstore.  I'd return it if I didn't have to ship it back to China.  Oh and it took a month to get here.",0
5,I love Laughing Giraffe brand! These are not a thin material like some others and the fit is perfect,1
4,"It's an adorable print with a semi-fair quality grade material. The bow in the front is flimsy but overall it's serves it's purpose for an average church day. If we were attending a wedding, I'd go with a better quality dress.",1
5,"This is a very flattering dress. The fabric is soft and comfortable. I intend to get it in other colors as well since it‚Äôs pretty affordable, too.",1
3,"I ordered a small because I'm a size 4-6. I got this for my bachelorette trip, but when it came in it was too short! I didn't find a model height regarding the dress, so I kinda just guessed it. I'm 5'7"" and and it hit right under my butt cheeks. It was too inappropriate for me, but if you're someone who's okay with that, then have at it! Other than the length, the fabric was of good quality considering the price and the top fit great!",0
2,good but poor quality,0
2,I need to return them. I ordered a size 10 which is true of every pair of shoes in my closet but these are very large. Need to return them for a full size smaller. Company sends a packing slip that says they do not do exchanges so I have to return and order new. Kind of a pain,0
5,Nice,1
5,Bought for my daughter.  She loves it.,1
2,Band broke second time I was worn. :(,0
5,Beautiful.  A Christmas gift for my Granddaughter and I am sure she will love them.,1
5,Love this belt. Wish I had ordered one long before now. Easy to use and looks great.,1
4,Minor flaws in the sewing,1
2,Arrived damaged. Cheap metal and much larger than expected. Does not fit well with other Major brand dangle charms.,0
5,"I love these glasses.  Compared to the standard sunglasses I was wearing while riding my bicycle, these are a dream!  They never slide down my nose and they help prevent sweat from getting in my eyes.  Plus, the ability to change the lenses has allowed me to ride more safely in different lighting conditions.",1
5,Great shirt ... !! I got so many compliments on it during the pre game tailgate !!,1
1,"First time i used it yesterday, zipper went down all the time!",0
4,"This is a very pretty dress. It is super adorable, is nice and stretchy, and is pretty comfortable too. The length is great; it hits right at my knees (I ordered a medium and I am 5'5""). It is form fitting, though. I ordered a medium because that's what I normally wear, but I didn't think about how form fitting this would be for it to hang correctly. It isn't uncomfortable in any way, but I feel like I have to constantly be sucking in my stomach while wearing it (I just recently had my second child and definitely have the so-called ""mommy belly""). From the front and back, the dress is beautiful and I feel lovely wearing it, but from the side since I still have the ""mommy belly"" it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. Even with that, though, I really love this dress and look forward to wearing it more when I have tightened my stomach muscles back up.",1
5,I received so many compliments on this hat! It comes with two flashing options and one solid light up option. It was great at Coachella for helping my friend locate me in the crowds. So much fun!,1
2,Too big and too long,0
5,"Great material, pretty, practical and comfortable.",1
4,"I do like this nightgown. Sizing is good and I think the price is right. It's a standard satiny fabric that feels good on your skin. What I like most about it is the length. It isn't something down to your ankles, providing more coverage than you need and trying to trip you. It also isn't so short that it rides up on you when you toss and turn at night. This seems to be just the right length for staying in place throughout the night. I've found it hard to find a nightshirt that finds that perfect balance between too long and too short, but this one is it. With that said, though, I think the style is lacking in some areas. The cut is, frankly, uninteresting. Aside from a rather strangely cut v-neck, it's really just a satin sack that you wear to bed. For this reason, I don't think it's the most attractive nightgown I've owned by far. However, with the perfect length and a soft material so light that you forget you're wearing it, it has quickly become one of my favorite night gowns.",1
1,Not true to size,0
2,"Since they changed the design to a rigid flap to insert in the wallet, the seam between the soft vinyl card pouches and the rigid vinyl tab tore within 1 week of the the insert being placed in service.  After a month, the only thing holding the card insert into the wallet is 1/4&#34; in the middle of the middle of the rigid tab.  While the flexible vinyl of the previous design eventually got folded and lost shapr in the tab area, it had lasted for several years before failure.  I was disappointed with the rapid failure of this design.",0
2,"These were just okay. They are nicely colored, but because they are white material that has been dyed, the white shows through where the laces are stretched (aka at every hole on the shoe where threaded, and where tied). The nylon also made for a slippery knot that came untied like crazy. I won't be using them for running shoes like I had hoped.",0
1,Very cheaply made. Came with two left side handles. Returned.,0
1,"After wearing these twice they look pretty bad. They‚Äôre peeling, and look ratty. I brought these on vacation for my daughter to wear, and was embarrassed to let her wear them.",0
5,"The butterfly shawl looked like the picture.  I initially purchased it for my son‚Äôs play. Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt able to use it because it arrived late due to my error.",1
1,Too small. Way too small.,0
5,Adorable and funny. Super comfortable and cute. I always get a big laugh and I love the cell phone pocket. Love them. Have several pair!,1
5,Absolutely Gorgeous and it looks quite stunning when hung.  Several people have complimented this after I hung it.  Very impressive!,1
5,"Love the watch.  Stylish, multi functional.  And Nancy was really helpful!!!!",1
5,Love it.,1
5,"I would recommend the cold shoulder vest to anyone trying to lose weight. I can't say that I have lost a lot of weight, but I think it helps and it is comfortable to wear.",1
2,"I bought a size 7/8 for my 6 year old. It seems to be about the right size, it's just the bottom part was poorly made so that  you'd need a larger size to prevent the issues multiple reviewers have cited(and then you'd be dealing with leg holes so large that you'd have other issues.)<br /><br />My daughter is in gymnastics 5 hours a week and spent all of class picking her leo because the cut is so high that if she actually does anything while wearing it she has it riding up in the front and back. I even put shorts on her for it because with the high cut it had way too little coverage.<br /><br />Overall she'll have to wear shorts with it and since she keeps having to mess with it in class I'll probably end up taking apart the bottom and altering it to somehow work since the return window has passed. Not something I want to do or should have to do.",0
5,I love this so much its so cute,1
5,"My hands stay cold, I've never had any gloves that warmed my hands while out in the cold until I purchased these gloves.",1
1,"Looks pretty, I put it on my case and had it around my wrist and fell apart and my phone fell on the floor. Very disappointed",0
5,"These gloves works very well, very reflective. They are well made. The owner is fantastic, she stands behind her product.",1
3,Great quality but wrong size. I ordered an XS and got an XL.,0
3,Guess I should have paid attention to the fact it only had 1 rating before I purchased it.  It‚Äôs so thin I can just about see right through it.  I‚Äôm trying it out on a 40-50 degree cloudy windy day and so far it worthless.  Seems it would only be good for warmer weather.,0
5,Authentic THD polo. Satisfied with the quality.,1
2,Heavy,0
2,They bend too easily,0
5,"These belts are fantastic!  The buckle is nice and flat so you dont have any bulkiness showing at the waist. I can wear slimmer fitting tops without worrying that my buckle will add a bulge to my tummy. I highly recommend these and just bought 4 for my sisters as Christmas presents. The company was great to work with, also.",1
5,I work in the back of a truck and we bang around a lot picking up product whatnot it might break that's okay because the what I paid for it is so cheap but the watch is top grade I am so pleased with it no I don't work for this company I know some of us wonder that when we read reviews this is a good honest review I couldn't have asked for a better buy it looks like an apple phone watch but it's not but you have an alarm on it it's just really awesome thank you to the Seller thanks again I probably will be buying from you again.... Thanks again for your great product,1
1,Very strange fit. The mid section between your legs is extremely baggy like a diaper. I sent it back.,0
5,Absolutely love this dress. It fits perfect!,1
5,So far daughter loves them better than the last ones we had that where made out of plastic. She wears a different color every day.,1
5,Perfect comfortable vivid design etc,1
1,Only had half the outfit delivered,0
5,Can't beat it.,1
5,"Held up well under cat ""attack""  My cats love them and so do grandchildren",1
4,"Overall, a great value!  I've gotten several compliments on it, but I wish the frame around the face wasn't so shiny.  The only real problem I have with it is that the date knob occasionally gets bumped and the date changes.",1
1,"I purchased diamond hoops from Dazzling Rock in the past and they were great; however, these ruby earrings were very disappointing.  The earrings were a different setting than shown and the rubies were so small I could bately see that they were red.  They were returned for a refund, but I will consider Dazzling Rock in the future.",0
1,Way too small.,0
1,This dress came with 5 little holes on the front of it.,0
5,Excellent socks. Keeps my feet warm. Love it,1
5,I love my dress! bought it for a cruise in January and got it today. Tried it on and fits perfectly! (I don't ever buy clothes online because I'm scared they won't fit) It is so soft and comfortable as well! Highly recommended!!,1
1,"This little purse is supposed to be PINK and the picture shows a lovely delicate pink color, which is what I ORDERED. A PINK PURSE. That is what I paid for. But what I received is not what anyone would call pink. It is a muddy clay color with a little mauve thrown in. Nothing at all like the picture. As for the purse itself, it is a fine bag for the price. Pattern is as pictured. It is large enough for a cell phone and thin wallet and some makeup. So I suppose if you ordered it in a color you can't get wrong, like black, you probably wouldn't have a problem. But I am very disappointed because I bought this to match my wardrobe. I wear a lot of pink. I do not wear a lot of clay and mud. One star for false advertising.",0
5,"These are fantastic. I compared them to a coworkers name brand Oakley Holbrook glasses and the differences are so small, no one would be able to tell without taking these off of your face.",1
3,Big shirt.  Collar is very wide too.  Would look elsewhere for a trendy banded collar.,0
2,Every pair I have gotten develops tears in the calf area within two months.,0
5,These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! They look great on my wife and she loves them.,1
1,Thin and cheaply made.  I do not recommend these gloves.  I can feel the stitching breaking after 2 uses. To much trouble to return during this period of self isolation.,0
5,Perfect let me breed I can use all day long,1
4,This is the most comfortable dress ever. It is very soft cotton and has adjustable straps which is nice. Very flowy and I love the pockets. It's definitely too long but I love it so much I'm just dealing with it. I'm 5'5&#34; and I have to hold it up a little while I'm walking so I don't step on it. it's also a TINY bit see through in the top but I only noticed once when I was wearing a patterned bra. Overall I like it a lot.,1
5,Amazing slippers bought a set for myself in men's and this set for my mother and we both love them very very comfortable for inside the house.,1
5,"Great quality, love this product.",1
2,"What I received is nothing like the picture. I ordered it for my daughter, but would be ashamed to give it to her. The one I got is all smashed together with tool marks all over it. I was very disappointed.",0
5,My daughter wanted a superman sweater like her daddy. Found this one that color changes and she went crazy about it,1
1,I was shocked when I took it out of the package. I am definitely returning this. The material is a cheap nylon like material. Definitely not worth the price and I would never wear it.,0
5,So comfy! I ended up buying a second pair!,1
1,Unexpectedly out of the size,0
5,"I got this metal-free belt for my dad, who discovered he has a nickel allergy. He's been wearing it since then with no problems, and he says it's very comfortable and durable. This was a great find, and we will definitely consider purchasing another belt from this seller in the future.",1
5,My mom enjoyed wearing this dress at our semi formal wedding on a hot day. She looked wonderful,1
5,"Absolutely stunning. It made my lumpy body look very sexy. The fabric is a perfect weight , heavy enough to smooth over underwear lines and has plenty of stretch. I received many comments from very stylish individuals who shop at some of the most exclusive shops. I wore it with with long pearls. Minor problem with getting the creases out. The fabric is quite sturdy and virtually waterproof. Used a steamer, then an iron with wet cloth. Worth every bit of effort.",1
5,"I absolutely love this dress. The fit is perfect and so flattering. I love the material. It is not clingy, yet so soft and comfortable. It‚Äôs a bit cold here, but the dress seems like it would work in cold and hot weather.<br />Just love this dress. Going to definitely be purchasing more.",1
5,I get compliments on these earrings all the time. The only two downsides: 1. the lapis lazuli doesn't seem like the highest of quality (but I don't complain at all for the price.) 2. Sometimes the little ball of lapis lazuli gets flipped outside the spiral and so I've grown the habit of checking them all the time.<br /><br />But all in all I love these earrings :),1
2,"Well, I was hoping this would help me. I have problems driving at night. The glare and the starbursts are really bad for me. I didn't notice much difference. Also, one of the lenses popped out.  However, I have been told this has helped some people.",0
3,I ordered this in dark Grey and loved how stretchy and slinky the dress was. Then I got it In the green color and the material is way different. Wayyy more cotton feeling,0
5,Very nice product for the price,1
5,"When ordering clothing online, you never really know if the item is going to fit true to size or not.  Even if it says it fits true to size, you can't always rely on it lol.  I'm here to tell you, this product really IS true to size haha!!  Not only do they fit as expected, but they're also as comfy as all get out!  The material has a nice soft feel to it.  It doesn't stick to my bedding or try to bunch up when rolling over (I'm a tosser 'n turner lol).  The print on it is super cute, and it's put together well!  No loose threads or anything. I highly recommend this pj set!!",1
4,I needed cheap sports bras and these were perfect. They come with padding but you can take them out. It was apt more comfortable without them. They come out just like they would in a bathing suit. I‚Äôm a 38C and ordered a large. Fit as expected.,1
1,Garbage,0
5,"I am now a Vera Bradley fan. Prior to finding this bag on Amazon, I had no idea about VB.  Well-made, distinctly different and so adorable!",1
5,"Very fast, the product is exactly the same as the pictures, really great service!",1
4,"These beads can be worn as a necklace or used for Buddhist (or I suppose other kinds) prayers. The beads are small, but can be counted when praying one by one provided one pays attention (they are pretty close together). The necklace is light-weight and, thus, comfortable to wear. It is also easy to put on or take off as the band stretches.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it five stars was that I thought the necklace and beads would be a bit larger.",1
1,"I bought it because it was a low price. But you get what you pay for. It was cheaply made, in my opinion. The beads on the necklace weren't the same size. And the bracelet where it is tied off looked  cheap.",0
5,Very pretty and sparkly! Lots of compliments:),1
5,I received this item just 3 days after I ordered it. My boyfriend loves it and gets many complaints. My two young boys will be getting one soon.,1
1,"first time that I've bought shirts for myself on Amazon. Size L, which I normally wear. First wash and now I've X-small. not to recommend, not at all",0
1,Product did not work. I do not recommend!!,0
1,They r so small on some of them u can hardly see them an the diamonds had fallen out of the studs. I guess u get what u pay for. Not worth the money!,0
5,"I love them<br />They are so much fun<br />I wear them to work, church EVERYWHERE",1
3,Es para proteger del sol,0
5,Looks great,1
5,Fits good,1
5,"These socks are so cute and fit me perfectly! Normally socks tend to fit a little big because my feet are small (US women's size 6), but these are perfect. Of course, that means that they will fit most people a little small. Just so you know. The colors are vibrant and they are adorable. They are relatively cheap, came in quick, get 6 different pairs, and fit perfect. Great deal!",1
1,I don't understand what the point of wearing shorts under anything is if you can see right through them to my butt crack. My actual butt crack can be seen through these and I'm a size 4.,0
5,Very comfortable for yoga and training,1
2,I was not happy with the quality of this dress --- it was returned,0
5,Bought for sons firefighter costume. Very easy to adjust. Super cute.,1
5,"Being an amateur jewelry-maker, this is one of those items I bought for parts. I love these types of modern lockets that allow you to wear actual little objects around your neck, and the fact that both halves screw together to create a tight seal makes it the most secure option available. The little gems were are definite throwaway for me, as is the short, unappealing chain. However, once I switch the chain out for a longer, nicer one, and add my own personal touches to the locket, it‚Äôll be a wonderful and unique addition to my jewelry collection!",1
3,"ok, not much insulation",0
1,Tried to contact this company about the missing sash... No response in months. Also the material is very thin... Id look more a more reputable company in the future.,0
5,Do not leak or fog!  Extremely nice,1

4,like,1
3,"I used this as a slip-in case for my eyeglasses, kept in an outside pocket of my purse. The quality is good but it's quite flat, so the glasses don't just slip in easily, you really need an extra hand to open it so you can slide your glasses in.",0
5,My daughter loved them,1
5,Very happy with product and the promptness of delivery.,1
1,I usually wear an 8-10 size dress comfortably. I ordered a Medium for this dress. When it came it was so small it was about 4 inches short of closing across my chest. Might have been mis sized. I would have called it an extra small! Went back!!,0
5,Beiatiful dress ‚ô° in love,1
5,So comfy!!! Great quality and great color! Could not be happier.,1
5,"I loved it! It was just a little snug and squished my boobs a bit, but I didn‚Äôt mind too much. Overall, I loved it.",1
5,Excellent seller communication and professionalism. Wallet is beautiful and I have already received compliments on it.,1
5,"I received my order today so I have not worn it at the gym yet so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs squat worthy BUT I love the fit!!!!! Not too small not too big, just right! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 140lbs and ordered a small. There were no holes or rips and is not see through. I highly recommend buying a pair!",1
5,TTS and works perfect as a school uniform top,1
3,Cheap hard material,0
2,"Returned immediately, frames were bent and didn‚Äôt fit.  Not sure if manufacturers issue or delivery issue but beware.",0
5,"My daughter wanted some Croc charms to decorate her new crocs. These were exactly what she was looking for. The 42 piece had the assortment and variety she wanted. They are well made and high quality. They are very easy to attach and remove. For the current price of $10, they are such a bargain! Highly recommend.",1
5,Can't live without these!,1
4,"Pros: light, breathable and comfortable<br /><br />Cons: bit pricey for the quality of fabric and something mass produced out of China. Color is not what was pictured in the photos but I expected that.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn‚Äôt purchase unless it was cheaper.",1
5,Great buy will purchase more,1
3,"The dress did not fit great but it is wearable.  The length was off.  It was XL as the previous dress, but did not fit as good.",0
3,Beautiful top. Too small for me. Worth the price but my &#34;muscles&#34; in my arms were just too big. üòâlol.,0
3,"The dress was perfect and fit well, I am 5'6 and normally wear a size small. Unfortunately the tights are extremely small, as i normally wear a size 2 in jeans and they didn't come up past halfway up my thighs. I did end up buying a new pair of tights. I agree with the other reviewers about the wig. I simply went without because id rather not be wearing a mesh cap with a little bit of yarn attached to it. Being that halloween costumes are expensive, I'd say the value (with the tights and wig issue) is more in the $30 price range.",0
4,"it is very beautifull,fashion,and legend.It is shiny in the sun. Is suitable in summer.I like it very much,so do my friends.",1
5,"These shorts were exactly as advertised. They were a true to size fit. The material stretches just enough for comfort, but not so stretchy that they become baggy while wearing. I think theses shorts are a good buy and I can recommend them.",1
2,Much smaller than expected. Wears more like a shirt than a dress.,0
4,This was too big. I thought that it was a regular shoulder bag.,1
1,"This is the second band replacement that I have bought from this vendor for the Fitbit Surge. The first one fit perfectly and lasted 15 months, the same as the original. The newest replacement will not even fit onto the clasp side. The injection molding seems defective. I will order from another vendor.",0
3,"Came in as described.<br /><br />Color is same as posted.<br />It folds as intended.<br /><br />But I had to return this as it feels it‚Äôs not that sturdy. Frame feels flimsy so I didn‚Äôt try wearing them around.<br /><br />Honestly I would have given this a shot and use it but I kinda felt weird with my vision when I tried it at home. Hence, the return.<br /><br />It could just be me and my eyes but I feel that for it‚Äôs price it‚Äôs worth the try.",0
5,"I love it, a little see through but not to the point where we can not wear it once a week for the practice",1
3,A little on the small side but still cute,0
5,Beautiful necklace,1
4,very nice blouse ...material is very soft.,1
3,Very cute but charms fall off easy,0
5,Excellent quality.  My wife loved it. I love the pink box - no need to wrap. The size was good for a medium wrist. I would recommend this as a great gift even if it is last minute.,1
5,Wonderful fit and material,1
3,"Dress pattern is beautiful and very stretchy, but very see through and pattern seems to turn white if it stretches to much, Buy 2 sizes bigger.",0
5,"They are weird when you are looking at your phone though, has a weird effect that hurts my eyes. They are fine to look at everything else and feel okay on the eyes on sunny days. We've had lots of sun and these sun glasses do shade nicely without making things depressing or overly dark like some grey lenses. I like the amber, bright driver style color, and appreciate the polarized effect for seeing into the water and being able to see through the glare and see the fish below the shiny surface. That's really fun. But, looking at the phone is crazy.  Good value for standard, dime store glasses. They come with a really nice case and they fit well. They are comfortable and stay on my face when I bend over. I like them. Big Hollywood style.",1
5,I LOVE these dresses!! Perfect for summer. They fit perfectly and a nice soft fabric too.,1
1,"Arrived wrinkled, poor quality, lightweight and a size 69 would not fit a size 46 person.<br />Delivery was quick",0
2,"It was cute, but the bust wasn't quite bug enough.",0
3,"I bought this robe to wear for my birthday. Since I couldn't go out, I hosted a virtual lingerie party, and it (the robe) was a hit!<br /><br /> What I loved... Even though its satin, it is pretty warm. It's double-layered, so it is suitable for cooler evenings. I took it off a few times because I got hot from dancing. I was worried it would be short on me. I'm 5'9'' and I planned to wear heels. I wore a 5-inch heel and as you can see it was still pretty long. And lastly, I felt so chic, royal, and glamourous, just like Suzzane Sugarbaker or Diana Ross :)<br /><br />What I didn't like... The fur trim is not fur. Unlike the picture, it's a few rows of slender feather boa. The belt is really long. and you'll have to wrap it around you several times. The gown didn't have a hook or inside ribbon like most robes. It also did not have belt loops. I had to make my own. Luckily I found a matching thread at Micheals.<br /><br />All in all, I like the gown and would recommend it. It is a good deal for the price, in spite of it not matching the pictures.",0
2,"It is a nice looking shoe, but not very durable.  The sole came apart within a month of daily wear.",0
3,it was comfortable and cute but a little frumpy,0
3,"This is for a very tiny wrist, however it is very pretty. I gave it 3 stars bc I dont know many women with such a tiny wrist.",0
5,Fits as expected and can‚Äôt beat the price,1
5,Did the job! Looks great,1
3,Shrinks in the first wash!,0
5,These are super cute and I haven't had any issues with my sensitive skin wearing these!,1
3,It is a very cute gymnastics outfit it fits well but is a little thin. Maybe because the color is light?,0
3,"The fabric is so thin you can almost see through them, poor material for making shorts.",0
4,Size fit exactly to size ordered. Nice and comfortable tunic,1
1,Looked like a silk bathrobe.,0
3,dress is great my daughter loves it and says its very comfortable the only problem was the elastic around the waist was plenty snug she isn't a chunky girl and it was a little too snug for her. You also get what you pay for there was a slight how in the pocket when it arrived:(,0
1,Online it looked to be a fitted dress but when I received it and try it on it was saggy and very lose fitting. I was not happy with the material at all I thought is a cotton/silk material but it was more a silky cheap looking dress. I want return it I'll just give it to somebody as gift.,0
5,The dress fit me perfect beautiful Just like the picture,1
2,"Read the reviews and got a size up, even I barely squeezed into them and they were too uncomfortable to actually wear for any extended period of time. Unfortunately will be returning.",0
5,Can‚Äôt stop the ideas for jewelry from bombarding my head!!  Sooo many great things to make!!  Thanks!,1
5,Nice and fast delivery,1
4,These are awesome for the price. I only gave 4 stars because after a little bit of time the coating on the front of the lense started to fray.,1
1,Runs very small. Also faded really bad on the pants and not the top.  Would definitely not recommend.,0
1,"I got the gray shirt and it's asymmetrical which wasn't stated in the info. It looks ridiculous. After the first gentle wash, the seams were coming apart, big time. HOW DISAPPOINTING.",0
5,"Fit perfect, feels great",1
5,Arrived on time and just what I needed. Works great and easy to use. Would order again and recommend to others,1
3,We‚Äôre correct size but didn‚Äôt fit son,0
5,It was great,1
5,I like everything,1
2,"They‚Äôre cute but they are NOT pink like listed, i bought these for my daughter to match my pink ray bans and they are more green and yellow than anything",0
5,"I have to admit that I was skeptical when I purchased this item.  I wondered if it was anything more than a swatch of fabric.  Well, I can say now that this thing is great, and serves a ,multitude of purposes.  So far, I have used it in these situations:<br />1.  I was fighting a cold, but had to walk the dog in a drizzly, cold Oregon evening.  I pulled this down over my nose and mouth to keep me warm.  This did an amazing job of keeping the chill out of me, especially since I was already fighting an illness.<br />2. I suffer from seasonal allergies.  It is so bad that I have worn surgical masks when I mow or garden.  Instead, I now use this over my nose and mouth.  Not only does it keep the grass and weeds from getting into my sinuses, but it helps draw away sweat.<br />3. I like to wear this on my head when I am in spin class.  Like a headband, it keeps my hair out of my eyes.  It also wicks away all of my sweat to keep it off my face.  Since it is open ended, It allows heat to escape my head.  Unlike a headband, I can pull this off, and wipe down my entire face, like a rag!  I can also soak it in water to give me the cooling effect of evaporation!<br />Overall, I can‚Äôt believe how many uses this has.  This item should be a staple in every gym bag!<br /><br />I did receive this product at a slight discount in exchange for my unbiased review.",1
4,Buy one size up!,1
2,Fastening loops rip off very easy.,0
4,"I bought these for my husband. He was having aching feet at a new job. When he wore them for about 3 days, he said they helped a little with achy feet but he really likes that they don't fall down when moving around and keeps his boots from digging in his ankles and legs.",1
4,It holds a lot of products.  I may need a bigger one in the future.  I tend to carry a lot with me when I travel.  I definitely like that it has many different pockets that are see through.,1
5,Really enjoy wearing this necklace. Might buy more later. Really enjoy Irish jewelry for men am thinking about a ring.,1
5,Great product,1
1,"my daughter loves gymnastics, she was getting really bad blisters and saw all these cool girls wearing gloves. We decided to surprise her with these gloves. My daughter used them for one dat then said ""it makes my blister worse it just makes me lose my grip on the bar, not keep it."" so don't buy these gloves unless that is what you want.",0
5,Exactly what I was hoping they would be. Heavy enough to be a quality product but not too heavy for my project.,1
1,Poor quality. Returned as soon as I opened package.,0
4,Beautiful,1
5,These worked great for my children to wear at the tractor pulls. I purchased two pair so my children's ears would be protected and they also wear them while out in the woods when chain saws are being used to cut fire wood. They work great for children who have sensitive ears and for parents who want there children's ears to be protected against loud noises. I highly recommend these earmuffs. They fit my child age 6 and 9.,1
4,"Not something that I would wear for a high impact workout, but they are very comfortable to wear. The back of the racerback comes up pretty high on the neck and shows on the items that I purchased these to wear under, though.",1
1,Returned. Small fit,0
4,Visca Catalunya!,1
5,As described,1
5,They are pretty well made.  I've had some others for about the same price and were very flimsy and broke easily.  These are much better made pair of glasses that fit over my regular glasses.,1
1,Not what I was expecting :(,0
5,"not the greatest material/quality for actually going out, I'm using it for a costume which should be fine.",1
5,I like them they are light for kids easy no falling from ears and soft material.,1
5,"These are super soft and super cute. The material is nice and lightweight. The fit is great and the length of the shorts is good and not too short, which I was afraid of. The set washes well, with no shrinkage and the color doesn't seem to fade and it never comes out of the dryer wrinkled. Fits true to size. It's a good quality product and it is so comfortable to wear.",1
5,Striking with the red roses and black background!,1
5,I first looked at getting the carbon fiber belt and then I saw the option to get a set of three belts and six buckles so I took the chance and I bought it. It gives you 18 combinations of buckles and belts.<br /><br />The buckles themselves are single molded pieces of aluminum or in the case of the carbon fiber it is weaved carbon fiber with a thick clear coat over it. The reviewer that said it wasn't real carbon fiber is wrong. The ones that say it's cheap because it's so light are also wrong. that's what carbon fiber is. It's very strong and very light. See my photo of the buckle next to my carbon fiber wallet and you will actually see the fibers interlinked in the sunlight. My carbon fiber wallet has more carbon fiber and was over $100. $90 is expensive but appropriate for what you're getting.<br /><br />They fit as advertised and are easy to adjust as advertised. I will mention that I am a more slender man and I understand people with larger bellies have issues with it. Hopefully you have a good experience like I did.<br /><br />Until I learned the proper way to take it off it was actually hard to take off first. Now it's pretty easy.<br /><br />I also took pictures of the belt hanger that is included in the box set. It appears to also be aluminum. It's two pieces put together. You can fit two buckles on each hook nicely but not 3. I tested that so that if I want to buy more buckles in the future I can put them on that hanger. It's good quality and extremely sturdy and it looks really good too.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with my purchase. These belts will last me a very long time.,1
5,This is a good quality shirt.  My husband has worn this numerous times and it is still it brand new condition.,1
3,Great pants just size way up like 2 sizes,0
1,demasiado malas es solo un pedazo de tela,0
5,"Awesome sports bras. I would say they're medium impact but if you have a big chest like me, you can layer two of them. I wear them daily to the gym for weightlifting and using the elliptical and the bras are comfortable and supportive. The green and blue ones are really cute too!",1
1,Very disappointed with this brand. None of them fit correctly. I was super bummed when I got them.,0
3,Turned my finger green after a week.,0
5,"Great belt, love it.",1
5,I love the color and weight of this rosary.  It feels more expensive than it is.  Great price!  I ordered a second one for my daughter!,1
3,It's bulky.,0
3,"Cute minimalist watch.  Keeps good time.  It is NOT waterproof which I discovered after wearing it in the shower.  However, a bag of rice got it working again, twice.",0
5,This bracelet is even prettier in person. Very pleased with its quality.,1
5,Looks even better on!,1
3,Cons: Sizing is not unaccepable. The main Issue is with sizing standards and them not being focused towards a specific demographic audience or even in U.S. standard sizes. Pros: Style,0
1,"The bra said push up and I thought it will push my breast even they are small but it's not.It makes chest looks flat.The panty fits real good and it is really sexy but after 4 hours of wearing it,I saw that it was tear off from the waist part.",0
4,"The material and fit were perfect. However, the seams are threading away. Yet I like them",1
5,SO beautiful! But too big in waist,1
5,Perfect will buy again,1
5,These socks were exactly as advertised and perfect for a California girl who likes to wear flip flops during the winter.  Shipping was really quick.,1
5,This costume was very well made and beautiful. I had lots of comments from my customers at the Bakery.,1
1,cheap made makes me mad spent so much money,0
1,"Really pretty earrings, but they broke as soon as i unpackaged them. really disappointed because i think they‚Äôre so cute and none of the gems are missing but the actual wire you put through your ear snapped off of the ‚Äúamour‚Äù plate. i still haven‚Äôt been able to successfully fix them :(((",0
2,I'm is pretty but the letter broke off putting it on,0
5,Fabulous and so cute. I wore them to work and I had people want to eat them!!,1
3,"Pros: Quality materials, great reflectiveness<br /><br />Cons: You have to be exactly the right measurements. There is no elastic in the cuffs nor the bottom of the coat. I am used to sleeves being too long but something to hold them in place would have been nice. The bottom of the coat was flowy and would allow for a breeze to get in easy. Not ideal for running in Wisconsin so I returned the item.",0
5,Very comfortable and cool. Very soft.,1
1,Stone fell out the first time I wore them,0
5,Beautiful and high wuality necklace......much more beautiful in person. The pictures doesnt do it justice.  Absolutely a stunning piece,1
5,"These hold tight onto my barbell, 5/5 would recommend, and order again if I had to.",1
2,"What's the point of Dog tags if you can't get them engraved , they have a poly face not metal , more of a kid's piece then an adults piece , was going to send them back but it would cost the same to return them &#34;CHINA &#34; as to  keep them , so in my junk jewelry they sit .if your looking to engrave your  DT's  look elsewhere",0
5,I love this dress definitely comfortable and yes it‚Äôs cotton üòç,1
5,"I'll be traveling quite a bit over the remaining summer weeks and wanted something comfortable, flattering, and quick and easy to wash and dry. This is very flattering, fits as expected, and will be perfect going from long walks to shopping to sporty-casual evening events!",1
5,I love this!! One hundred percent authentic and stainless steel!  Amazing quality and looks like high end! Will purchase more from this seller! I received my order right away! Thank you!,1
5,best keychain,1
1,"I rated everything five star because it WAS true however after I had worn them only 3 or 4 times, a tear occurred in the mid section of the sock.  The one star rating is because none of the other ratings matter if I can't wear the socks.  DEFECTIVE?  I would have expected to find a ""guaranteed"" statement of some sort to easily replace the sock however, there is NO guarantee.  I don't expect my compression socks to last forever but I do expect more than I received on this pair.",0
2,The jeans were made well.  They are just difficult to button and unbutton.,0
5,"Very well made, half the price of similar items made in foreign countries in sweat shops and supports the work of very special Carmelite sisters.  I believe you will be well pleased with it.",1
5,My daughter loved it as soon as she saw it ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you so much,1
5,"LOVE these! Can't beat the price & I like the fabric because it's a little stretchy but not too slick to stay in place. I didn't realize these are more of a strip of fabric than an infinity-scarf concept, so they're super easy to adjust, too!",1
2,"[[VIDEOID:2240070918cb4e9b6a195b6cbc9cfc46]] I have a perfectly normal size 12-12.5 foot. I always buy a size up, so I bought a size 13. It was STILL too small to fit my foot, and the plastic clip broke almost immediately. Even if it had held, there was a thoroughly insufficient amount of Velcro left to hold the shoe closed. The sole construction looks weak, but the straps didn‚Äôt last long enough to test that. If I had had a chance to try these on in a physical store, or even to take a good look at the, I would never have bought them. Cheap, shoddy shoes. 2 stars instead of one because delivery was prompt and they were well packaged. So, yay Amazon, Boo shoe manufacturer.",0
5,"Great Quality, quick delivery.",1
4,This band fit too loose however I have a tiny wrist,1
5,Muy peque√±o les kedo algo ajustado..<br />Pero esta hermoso,1
1,"Buy 2 sizes larger than you would normally wear if you intend to launder it @ any time. All of my laundry, except towels, is done on warm wash/cold water rinse & low/perm. press heat. I had it in the dryer for 20 mins., then hung it up to finish drying.  This thing shrank @ least 2 sizes. Garbage. I got one wear out of it!",0
5,Great fit and quality material.,1
1,Poor quality bag... not stylish at all...doesn‚Äôt look like leather..another crap made in China...,0
5,So cute... Little bigger then I thought but thats fine.. just went out and got a bigger purse.  fits all I wanted to get in there.,1
2,If you have a larger chest this item is not for your. You'll be exposed on the sides. Cute suit just didn't fit me right. Seller provided full refund.,0
2,Cute but extremely small!,0
5,Really cute well made<br />Little bit smug in chest but I'm a D<br />And got a medium good fit overall,1
1,Garbage,0
1,"Unlike the pics this bathing suit is very fitted, not flowy.  If you order, order AT LEAST 2 sizes up!!!",0

1,"It came kinda in a bad condition, it is very different compares to the one l bought the first time.",0
2,The polarization is awesome on these they are great lenses. However they dont fit as snug as they should in the frames. They are just a little small but as long as you don't touch the lenses they stay in pretty well.,0
5,Super cute!,1
5,"This is the best brand of prism specs, I have since bought more for my wife. I have a huge head and she has the tiniest head size possible - they fit perfectly for both of us so as long as you don't need to wear prescription glasses underneath, you can ignore any reviews that say otherwise. They aren't bulky or heavy - nice and light and super comfy even for hours and hours at a time (we had a LOTR marathon with these lol). They are super crisp, image wise. They're super nice on the neck and back and I can't imagine going back to watching things in the bedroom without them. Amazing product! Also, I've tried a few brands and this is the best - they will fit glasses underneath (my wife says it's perfect for this but I don't wear glasses so I can't personally say anything myself on this) and the way these are designed with the wrap around, it really helps with redirecting the peripheral vision so that you really only see the screen that you're watching (whether it's a tablet or a tv). Hope this helps somebody!",1
5,these were a huge hit with the person I bought them for!,1
5,Looks very sleek and sexy.  You need to get this one ! Perfect for  an evening out or a girls night .,1
5,"Very pretty design,  Like the red wood beads, with accent Blessed Mother charm, and crucifix.  A great gift for anyone.",1
5,really great tights...fit good,1
1,This women's XL was barely large enough for a small 8 year old child. Ridiculous. I would not purchase anything from this seller again.,0
3,Not a big fan of the skinny jeans but they fit good and cute,0
3,Good quality but will not fit over glasses.,0
1,high waisted. You have to pull it down constantly and it runs small. The good thing is that material is stretchy and u can make it usable.<br />Also the cut of polka dots at the waist line is terrible. It makes the dress look weird like is not even.,0
2,"The fabric was so stiff And cheaply made, so much shorter than I was expecting.. yes I knew it was a crop top but it literally could have fit my 5 year old. The design doesn't look like the picture but I still liked it",0
2,they don't have a handle on the bottom and the handle on the top has started to give away and coming  lose,0
5,Nice piece of jewelry......,1
4,Very nice,1
4,"First off, it's a great value. The fit is spot on and the length is just what I was looking for. 4 Stars for now just because the material/contruction does feel a little thin. Could be a good thing. It's lighter an less bulky under shorts etc. But I have to see how it holds up in the wash and usage.<br /><br />Will revise a bit later.<br /><br />For now, 4 Stars",1
3,"There was a small minuscule knick on the top of the setting.  Overall, a cute ring for a teenage girl.",0
5,Love the look but too small !,1
3,"This is a maxi jersey tank top.  I  really expected a dress of jersey material that got wider as it  got longer.  or a jersey dress shaped like a triangle (tapered at the top and bottom and wide in the center where the pockets are).  This dress basically straight up and down.  Not at  all the look I was looking for. It is not thin. But if the sun is bright, you will be able to see  your undies.  I am 5'7&#34; and it comes to the top of my ankles.  So it will become a knock around dress. Not something I will wear out.  I could not wear heels with  it. I know it says beach  dress, but the  picture  iludes that it maybe worn casually out.",0
5,Those masks are just fine.,1
3,They are not as binding as others I‚Äôve tried. Had they been long enough to reach the knees they would have worked better and probably have been less binding.,0
4,"Love them. Other than they smell incredibly strange and slightly unpleasant. I'm hoping this fades with time/exposure to open air. Otherwise, exactly as I hoped!",1
5,Soft and just right.,1
5,Soft and comfy,1
5,"Comfortable and good looking, stretch fit makes them very relaxed and comfortable!<br /><br />The colors look quite nice in person",1
3,"Clasp broke on first wear :( return was simple. They were a lovely design, but the clasp doesn‚Äôt reflect the quality of the rest of the earring.",0
2,"The fabric is way too heavy...I was expecting something lighter and more flowing.  Very disappointed. The design is great though, have been looking for a nice swing type robe/house dress but the weight of the fabric makes it very uncomfortable to wear.....unless you are looking for something to keep you warm...but it has short sleeves so why would you choose this style to stay warm. I",0
3,Too bIg looking on my wrist and I‚Äôm not small-boned.,0
2,"Doesn't do much for night driving. Doesn't seem to make things brighter or reduce glare at night. Works well on a cloudy day and they look nice, but if you want them for night driving, don't waste your money.",0
5,This was a gift...but was told so very pretty..goes with everything..,1
5,ok,1
5,Fits perfect light weight perfect for spring,1
4,There are a few snaggly strands but overall it's very nice!,1

1,"1. Did not receive the amount of rocks ordered, I think maybe half?<br />2. Some of the rocks were not as pictured, some being a piece of small round cement colored material. Would not be a huge deal if I did not have a plan for use where I needed them to be all same size/shape.",0
4,"Seems like good quality.  Of course, it hasn't been washed yet.  Fits as expected.",1
5,Stylish and reliable!,1
5,"Great colors, very durable, and easy to wipe clean. Toddlers love them because they‚Äôre comfortable and colorful. I‚Äôd buy these again in a heartbeat but haven‚Äôt had to because they‚Äôre so sturdy.",1
1,Very gaudy. More like Halloween jewelry than wedding or prom jewelry.,0
3,Looks better in the photo. Runs big too. Obviously not an official item. Shirt material was very heavy and uncomfortable.,0
3,"I am not impressed.  The mask does not fit well. It is smo large that it works it‚Äôs way up my face and covers my eyes in just a few seconds after adjusting it to fit as well as possible.  I ordered a similar men‚Äôs mask for my husband and his fits him just fine.  My mask fits him too.  Silly me, I expected the women‚Äôs  mask<br />to be smaller than the men‚Äôs.",0
5,Good socks,1
4,"Well made & soft silky material. It's a beautiful color blue also. Make sure & order a couple sizes up because it runs small. (I generally wear a s/m but ordered a large & it fits perfectly) Some people said it was too short but I like where the hemline hits, it makes for a more flattering look. My biggest issue with it is that it is hard to keep it up on the shoulders. It slips off unless you pin it to your bra straps. But it does look & feel kinda &#34;sexy&#34; & feminine (without being over the top revealing or trashy) with a pretty bralette. Other than having to pin it to keep it up, I was l pleasantly surprised by this purchase!",1
5,So I am one of the few to wear a pair of shorts like this until they literally fall apart aka the elastic  dies out in the waist band. After finally deciding to throw out my two faithful pairs of nike shorts I went with this brand and I am very pleased. The XS fits perfectly with my measurements being 5'8 115lbs 26in waist 33in hips. I love the vibrant color and they are not indecently short so I can wear them for working out running or just lounging around.,1
1,too small,0
2,I love the colour of this dress. But it is way too small.  I cannot wear it. Will have to give it away. not true to size. I gave two stars for the colour,0
1,I was so disappointed to receive this and see that it has two screen printed graphics on the green side of the cape.  It doesn‚Äôt show that in the image so I never would‚Äôve guessed it wasn‚Äôt plain green.  At least it‚Äôs made with good quality or I would definitely send it back.,0
1,I ordered a medium based on my measurements and what the size chart said and it's gigantic. It is too large to fit my size large husband. The sizing looks like an extra large. I waited forever for it to arrive and now it's days before Halloween and it won't work at all. I'm so disappointed. My Halloween costume is ruined. My son and I were supposed to be Naruto and Kakashi together...,0
2,"Working in a meat department I need good quality shoes. The sole of the shoe is great to prevent slips and falls. Unfortunately, the shoe started to rot.

Well for me it is lol.  I love how scrumptious they make my bums look they fit a little bit firm on the buttock but nothing uncomfortable. After these images I used them in my cardio session and they held up nicely! No rolling up and no chafing which is an issue for big thigh girls.  They also help provide tummy control and I am so happy I decided to go with this color it's beautiful and so vibrant these shorts  are not see through so you may go in cognito underneath, it's breathable for your girl down there :)",1

Ok fine I could deal with that as it was pretty and fairly inexpensive, but with in a week of wearing , the  stone fell out and I didn't notice until hours later, so stone was lost forever.",0
1,This product broke as soon as I placed it on the ring!! I looked up ring guards for men rings and this came up but it was flimsy and fell apart!!! I am very disappointed üòë,0
4,"Very pretty dress, it is exactly as pictured. The sizing is good.  The first time I tried it on the sequins rubbed against the area right below the armpit causing redness and discomfort. I was short on time so I kept the dress and was mindful while wearing it.  I don't know if others have experienced this or maybe my skin in that area is sensitive to the material, (never has happened before though). Other than that, it's a nice dress.",1
4,Very comfortable! If I have to say something will be that pants are really running big but is part of the comfortable thing. Very nice and soft fabric.,1
5,Great product nice container too,1
5,Ordered for my husband who loves it. Fit as expected and still soft after washing.,1
4,Nice for man,1
5,"Truly love this cap and so happy that now my ears will not hurt from wearing masks 24/7! It's 100% cotton, super comfortable, and easy to take on/off. Does not itch my head or fall off as headbands do. So glad I found this; very nice seller.",1
5,The dress was very beautiful and very comfortable to wear my baby loved it,1
1,"Barely use it but last time I did use it (I have other ones), one of the small tabs broke off.",0
5,It was thinner than I thought it would be but it is surprisingly warm. Ended up liking it way more than I thought I would.,1
1,This was a HORRIBLE EXTREMELY CHEAP coat ! The material is plastic like and has defects in the printing. The hems are crooked. The fit is horrible! I threw it directly in the garbage. Not even worth 5 bucks. I  found an amazing one on ASOS.com.,0
2,Not what I expected,0
5,Love them!,1
1,Not at all how it looked on line. Sticks to you.,0
2,"My wife wears straw hats and this one doesn't fit. She was so disappointed- it was too small. If not for that, the hat would have been terrific. Even the bucket part doesn't fit over the head entirely, just not deep enough. Inside of the hat is a sort of drawstring function to tighten the hat. That part fits just fine- the bucket is just not deep enough.",0
3,Probably not the most accurate when comparing to other trackers,0
1,Cheap material. Can‚Äôt use all of the card holders because they‚Äôre too tight.,0
1,"They are very cute but the end pieces (ear pieces) were not durable. They didn‚Äôt even fit, very loose.",0
3,The top seems to be a bit big then expected,0

5,"I have received so many compliments on this pocketbook. It's well made, plenty of room and affordable.",1
3,"Unremarkable purse. The bottom of it was as big as the whole purse (the purse is essentially a cube), so it was awkward as a shoulder bag. Nice bag, but it got sent back. Lots of others to choose from at that price.",0
2,Low quality.,0
5,The pearls are lovely and the sterling silver is high quality! Definitely recommend!,1
5,Love it!,1
5,"What a beautiful scarf! The galaxy print looks great and it feels nice and airy, perfect for a Fall day. I get so many compliments when I wear it.",1
5,"I love these earrings.  The order came with various sizes, great value for the money.",1
2,very frumpy.  Looks like a wrinkled sack.,0
5,I got this last minute before Valentines Day to finish off my gift to my love. And honestly I think she like this more then the other things I got her. Plus it matches her Team Herbivore hoodie.,1
4,perfect workout tops,1
5,even more beautiful than picture,1
2,"They were too small. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them.",0
1,Super small and totally not appropriate for any child older than 8 I would say. They look ridiculous on my 11 year old daughter.,0
5,"I wasn't sure how the quality of the silver would actually be, it is delicate and detailed, beautiful. My friend who I bought it for was so happy!!!",1
3,Beautiful but just ‚Äògreen‚Äô<br />Not jade...a very dark green...,0
5,Bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it! Perfect fit!,1
1,"HORRIBLE. I ordered the light pink in a size medium. It fits fine but the material is SO thin and SO see-through. I could literally see my belly button (and everything else) through the material with it on. The fabric is so thin and feels so so cheap, like it is going to unravel if one string comes loose. Also, the pictures are not a good representation of color.I will definitely be returning.",0
1,poor quality,0
4,it feels pretty comfortable and breathable<br />good for running on hot summer days,1
1,Came broken,0
1,"Extremely small, not even close to the right size when it comes to fit.",0
5,My granddaughter loved them!,1
3,I love the color and length. I ordered Ann large. It wears like a large. I prefer large but I order large to have some five when I wash it. I won‚Äôt place this dress in the dryer; I may send it back for the next size.,0
5,Great glasses for the price absolutely love them,1
2,"They aren't the designs I chose, but they took so long to arrive, I had forgotten all about them.  I didn't know when I ordered, but these things are too small for me, anyway.",0
3,Cute little piece of jewelry. Very small hoop though.,0
4,"Brilliant LED shoe although I ordered White and black arrived, sent back and tried 3 more times to receive BLACK every time, my daughter refused to wear &#34;Black Boy&#34; color so I gave up.  Basically if you want Black, fantastic they are amazing LED shoes and an amazing price.",1
5,Very stylish and easy to install and change.,1
5,"This is a good selection of multiple colors at a reasonable price. The half socks stay on and are perfect to wear with loafers and low-cut canvas/athletic shoes to help wick sweat and keep your toes dry and cozy. Material is on the thinner side, which makes it easier to wear with more shoe styles and won't add bulk to or stretch your shoes. They are easy to misplace and could get lost in the washing machine, so keep them in a zippered laundry mesh bag to prevent this.",1
2,"It is much baggier and bulkier than I was expecting, and it is quite thin",0
5,These are soft and stretchy exercise shorts. They fit good and allow for ease of movement with the great amount of stretch in them.  I like that they have a pocket to hold your personal items. They hold my phone well as well as my keys or even my water bottle securely.  they are mid to bottom of my thigh length and they do not roll. They are very comfortable and are not see through if you get the correct size and fit.,1
5,nice and comfortable. would buy again.,1
5,I love it! It‚Äôs one of my favorites now.,1
1,Returned .... It was just an odd fit,0
5,Lightweight copper makes this easy to adjust. It's quite small in the box but I adjusted it with no problem. The cutouts have raised copper edging. The background is pearly white. This bracelet is more comfortable on my wrist than many cuff bracelets due to limited area of maximum contact with top of wrist. It looks far more expensive than what I paid for it.,1
4,price is good.Quality o.k. I added stick on bifocal lenses .,1
3,Turned my finger green and tarnished within a week of wearing it.<br />Delivery was fast though!,0
5,Love Ove Love,1
5,"Fit my husband well, good quality and a great price.",1
2,Very thin material.  The zipped pockets aren‚Äôt big enough even for my small hands,0
1,Dress arrived smelling like smoke and it didn't appear to be brand new.,0
2,The fabric was see-through and felt cheap. It didn‚Äôt look right on me. I returned it.,0
2,"I like the idea of this shoe but I ordered based on the size chart, actually measuring the foot, and the shoe is too small. The toes are sticking out over the sole, pushing on the fabric. When I came back to exchange for a larger size, it was out of stock so I ordered a similar one elsewhere on Amazon in a larger size which has room for growth.",0
1,Not what I thought it would be durability is trash,0
2,Didn't really care for these.,0
2,Doesn‚Äôt look anything like the picture looks like a really long tee shirt minus what I thought was a bow at the bottoms but I guess that‚Äôs how she‚Äôs holding it up,0
1,"It‚Äôs a thin, shapeless tank dress with far thicker straps than shown in the item pics.",0
5,Nice,1
3,way bigger than anticipated.  returned.,0
1,The shirt was made very poorly- it's see through and isn't even on both sides from the neck to the shoulder so it pulls to one side/ lays crooked and can't be worn,0
1,Received one and not two in box. Returning.,0
3,"Super cute and nice quality, but way too small. So disappointing! You'll love these if you're a tiny girl.",0
1,Material is wierd and print is not good,0
5,I got this primarily for when I have to do errands. They‚Äôre great if you have glasses and have been having issues with other masks.,1
5,"I love PSD underwear. These are made a little different the usually PSD underwear. They are polyester)mesh and are just a bit tighter than the regular ones. I wear a small. But they fit great, just s little too tight for sleeping. No comparison to any other underwear. Non.",1
1,The jewels are not in proper order,0
4,Like all off the shoulders it always pops up off your arm and goes over your shoulders. Just gotta constantly pull it back down but it's soooooooo cute. Got tons of compliments,1
1,Top fit the pants were a size too small. Had to buy another pair of 3T pants for my grand baby to wear the top!!!,0
5,i love this kaftan - I will get plenty of use this summer.,1
3,"UPDATE: I reordered these for the third time Sept 2021. They are significantly larger than 1.5 millimeter that I have always gotten from this company, plus they seem to tarnish very quickly. I'm changing to stainless steel.<br /><br />These last forever! This is my second order. My first order was 8 years ago! They are the perfect diameter for me. Tiny & super sparkly. After I apply makeup, I dip a q-tip in alcohol and dab the stone. Makeup is all gone & I'm back to workout!",0
5,"Love this set! It is so comfortable and would be perfect for breastfeeding Mamas!<br />I ordered a large but probably could get away with a medium, but I prefer my pajamas to be a little oversized",1
1,"first time I tried to put them on my glasses they popped apart, after a while I was able to get them back together, tried a different approach, popped apart again and gave up",0
5,"Well made, highly recommended.",1
5,Nice fabric and quality. Has an oversized fit which is very comfortable.<br />I am very short (5'1&#34;) and it goes down to right below the knee.,1
3,Beautiful dress but to clingy had to returned,0
3,Ended up returning - for some reason it looks a lot better in the pictures than in real life.,0
1,I was really excited about this and thought it was so cute but the clip the connects the strap to the purse immediately fell apart when I took it out of the bag. Very disappointed I used string to try and fix it,0
5,I liked nice ..,1
3,"I ordered a medium which worked out to be a good choice, I'm 5'3/4&#34; and weigh 136lb. It's pretty, I like the material and it fits nicely on my body. However it's slightly poorly made. My chest line is uneven.  You'll see the crooked pattern is in the picture I'm posting. That's going to adjatae me.",0
2,The sweatshirt is made of strange material.  It's soft (sort of) on the inside but the outside is stiff and not soft at all.  Not really that comfortable to wear. Thinking it might be more useful as a layer to protect against light rain since the outside feels slick and plasticky.,0
3,"Update: one laundering and on my second wearing of the floral one I bought, and the material is pilling. ****Haven't tried to wash it yet -- will be sure to update if laundering the dress makes for a problem. It looks pretty much how I expected, and the material is very thin (and seems like it would snag easily) like others report. The stitching is poor around the pockets and one pocket in fact has a small hole. It fits as expected. I ordered large. I'm 5'5, 140 lbs, slightly pear shaped. Honestly, if I had seen this dress in store versus online, I would have thought the $24 price tag is just a little too high. I don't like it as much as I thought I would by the photo.",0
5,Came on time had to let two links out but watch so far it works perfectly very luminous and can be seen at night with the bedroom lights out. With white markings on black dial very easy to see during the day as well so far very pleased,1
4,"Great prayer shawl, this was a gift but I plan to purchase one for myself",1
2,product arrived damaged,0
2,The wallet looks great but isn't...its really hard to remove cards from outside pockets. also there's glue on the inside of,0
3,Underestimated the size of the charm. Pretty if you like a big charm,0
5,Fits well and looks good. What more could one ask for?,1
5,Good safety addition during the Cocid era.,1
2,did not like the material to harsh on my skin.,0
5,"Got these for my wife, and she loves them!  Plus, it makes her look sexier, accentuating the best parts of her gorgeous body!",1
1,I originally bought this belt to wear as I walked my dog at night. The LED light never worked even after charging for 4+ hours. Cheaply made defective product. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.,0
1,Lenses pop out,0
1,The dress was falling apart upon arrival.  Not sure that it was actually sewn in some places.,0
5,"They arrived in a reasonable time, given the state of things. Thay look nice and sturdy, they are the right size, and slipped right in to the bands.",1
4,The CZ is larger than I expected. Would have preferred it to be smaller to allow more focus on the dolphins Love the tight fitting backs to avoid losing an earning.,1
4,Like the shape and the quality of this glasses. Too bad it's small for my frame,1
4,It fits OK except for the fact that you cannot tell where the back or the front is and if you have a big but it tends to have a lot of gathering in the back not leveled out but it‚Äôs fine I got lots of compliments it‚Äôs it‚Äôs OK otherwise I would buy again in a different color,1
4,"Not bad but I wish the bracelet was bigger (not around the wrist but the actual bracelet). Also,  broke about a week after I bought it.",1
1,Disappointed that they were not a 16 gauge. More like an 18.,0
1,Chain changed colors on second day.,0
1,"the ears are stick with glue, eyes came out after week of use.",0
5,I love them so much that I am going to buy more!!!,1
5,"It is actually very cute . Got it for mom she likes sparsely stuff , she loves it . Def recommend",1
3,Too small! Thought It would be bigger. Can‚Äôt really fit much in it. However great material and style,0
3,Smelled of smoke.,0
1,"So terrible. I am 5‚Äô10 which may have partially contributed tto the problem- but this dress - in white- is a cheap, Lycra, see through, long t shirt. It was the most terrible quality and fit and looked absolutely nothing as depicted. Don‚Äôt make the mistake!",0
1,"Got this belly ring for surgery since you can‚Äôt have anything metal in... literally fell out right after surgery pointless, now it‚Äôs going to close. Super annoyed.",0
5,Works like a charm.,1
1,This is NOT childrens size... my husband who is 6 feet tall and wears a 3x can wear this and it still is somewhat loose,0
5,Good quality.  A little tight in the width.,1
1,"This was extremely small, without any compression whatsoever. Even ordering a larger size wouldn‚Äôt be good so nice the material is very thin and the white was completely transparent. Think of spandex stretchy tissue paper.",0
2,Most of the earring backs are very difficult to open. I could not open the ones I wanted to wear.,0
5,It is exactly what I wanted.  I am going to Europe where there is a 6 hour time difference.  My plan is to have the correct time on my watch and home time on the clip on watch.,1
2,"Band looks good, but the adapters do not fit squarely into the Apple watch. Too unstable. Decided to return it.",0
5,Perfect fit. Waist band not to tight,1
2,Material is very cheap and sticky,0
3,"VERY WARM. Not for Summer. But excellent quality, beautiful print and very comfy. I'm excited to wear it this Fall/Winter 2020.",0
4,Super soft and warm! I am 5 feet tall 110 pounds the size small is nice and loose and hits me at my lower shin. I only give it four stars because I think it is overpriced. It‚Äôs the name I guess.,1
3,I must say the style of these dresses are very pretty and they fit well. Unfortunately the dresses are made of thin material and see thru. I ordered a light color and a dark color and still the same issue. Sorry I had to return them.,0
4,The hat fits well,1
5,My grandson absolutely loves it,1
2,Good for party favor but very poor quality,0
4,nice set,1
4,This Charm is really beautiful.  As for the opener!  I DID NOT RECEIVE THE PANDORA OPENER.  IT WAS NOT IN MY SHIPMENT. THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I ORDERED THIS BUNDLE.,1
3,It is very nice.,0
1,Much larger than photos appear.,0
1,Way too small! Ordered a 2xl and it's very small. It's more like a junior size medium. There is nothing lose fitting about his top. Very disappointed! Will be returning this.,0
5,"I was gifted with this light and then purchased 3 for my friends.  I use the light on my night stand.  I find it handy for finding something when I don't want to wake up others by turning on a light.  Also, the soft glow is perfect for checking on a baby at night. I dropped it and the 'lid' came off but was able to secure it again and it continues to work perfectly without any damage.",1
5,"I think these bags are wonderful! Very roomy, durable, and easy to transport! The carrying case is very convenient!",1
5,"I absolutely love this shirt!! It fits PERFECT!! I bought it to wear on thanksgiving and got a lot of compliments. It‚Äôs great quality and the color is awesome! I got the dark green one with the ‚Äúthankful grateful blessed‚Äù and pumpkin in the middle. I ordered an XL (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 190lbs, usually a size 12/14)",1
2,not like the picture,0
2,"These used to fit perfectly but now the necklines are either too small or too large, and there is strings sticking out of the neck!!!",0
3,"I ready good things about these gloves, my son went skiing in 25 degree weather and his hands were cold in a matter of 2 hours.  We just bit the bullet and purchased some Hestra Heli's and he never had cold hands again.",0
5,Beautiful necklace. My son loved it.,1
1,"The apron is super thin, and light weight if you wanted that. The apron smelled horrible when taking it out of the package, to the point where others noticed it smelt. It smells like fake chemical leather, very strong.",0
3,Hole in bottom,0
5,Super cute dress for baby girls,1
5,I loved how the blouse fit me,1
5,Good buy,1
5,"IT IS VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL AND THE PERFECT SIZE! IT WAS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!",1
1,"Does nothing!  Doesn‚Äôt grip, doesn‚Äôt help turn the window crank.",0
2,"Disappointed!  While the jacketvwas soft and super cozy, there were two holes in the seam of the collar.  I am returning it for a refund, but out the $4.98 shipping.",0
2,They advertise that the neck is loose - floppy would be a better description and I have an 18' neck.  I very much like the materials and the rest of the shirt fit,0
3,Too narrow towards the knee.,0
2,"Necklace is great, but the earrings came with Jack broken from the posts.",0
4,Love the size and texture of the clutch.  Zipper works well and there's a lot of space inside for cards.  I just wish it was a bit larger - but that's probably not the product's fault.  Just glad my credit cards are now protected.,1
1,"They are very pretty. But you can't walk with them on, it gets twisted and doesn't stay in place well.",0
1,"I loved the color, but an XL is like a medium.  6 inches smaller around the waist then XL from Kohls.",0
3,"They are too small. You should order 1-2 sizes bigger than expected if you're a man. I am 240 lbs 5'10"" bodybuilder build and an XXL fits like a fitted shirt on me. It is roughly the same proportions as a large Nike golf polo. So significantly smaller than expected. Great shirt though!",0
5,It was a gift to my granddaughter and she love it.,1
4,Have not used them for actual travel but they look useful.,1
5,beautiful,1
3,"Nice jacket! I really like the warm fleece lining that no other rain coats (for adults at least) have in them.  It would make it great for fall/spring weather without having to worry about layering up.  Unfortunately, the jacket was sized too small and our auras didnt mesh, so I returned it.",0
1,Muy transparente,0
5,"This dress was BEAUTIFUL. Bought this for my sisters prom and it was amazing. True to size, and the quality is great!<br />UPdate my sister finally wore this dress to prom (i will post pictures) and everyone complimented her dress, they were just a s in love with it as I was. The material, the color, just everything was PERFECT.",1
5,"Love this dress! I ordered a M ( my measurements 38""x29""x42"") and it fit perfectly. I did wear a push up bra and wrapped the center tie of the dress around the middle part of my bra to hide it. Didn't realize it had a side zipper but I pulled it over my head due to the waist being stretchy. Iron on low setting. Fantastic date night dress!",1
5,For the price this coat is fantastic.  WSrm comfortable and looks great,1
3,These were so cute but the hats (which came preassembled) kept breaking. Either the string would pop or the fuzzy ball would just fall off.  The sign had to be threaded which was annoying considering other signs made by different manufactures coke threaded already. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again and it‚Äôs completed unusable now but it was cute while it lasted.,0
5,Pantalonngrande jacket peque√±o,1
2,"The cream colored set was actually yellow.  The knitting/crocheting of the overall product was very loose.  When you put the mitten on, the stitches stretch and you can clearly see your skin through the mittens.  Will not keep anyone warm, that's for sure.",0
4,pretty and very dainty,1
3,I just can't seem to find a pair that are comfortable for my very flat feet.,0
5,This shoe is perfect for my racquetball game. I bought this to try as this was the first time i am buying this brand and overwhelmed by the quality of the product. It has beat my expectation and wonderful job done by the makers of this shoe. Can't thank you more for such a perfect shoe for such a reasonable price.,1
3,"I ordered this thinking that it was &#34;real&#34; terrycloth and was disappointed that it is some kind of thin synthetic.  However, I kept it because I needed it for hospitalization and did not have tome to get another one.",0
5,"I have had my dark leather Lucio for about 5 months now. When I saw it, it reminded me of something that my dad used to carry and that I thought was so functional! It turns out that I needed something to keep my pockets empty yet carry my wallet, 2 cellphones, diary for notes, pen, and a few small papers. With those items I can work away from the office and I don't have to carry my laptop and briefcase: a huge load reduction.<br /><br />The Lucio has a swivel wrist strap that clips on the side. This is a great feature for keeping your hands free when necessary. Inside there are 4 sections: The first section is large and fits my diary and 1 cellphone, there is also a leather loop for a pen that is actually usable. Then there is a divider which is a pocket with a zipper on top. This is where important papers can go. The next section has a cellphone elastic holder, which I use, and enough room for my fairly big wallet. In front of the bag, where the closure clicks in place, there is another pocket with a business card holder sewn on the inside. The clip can lock with a key but I lost it and don't miss it.<br /><br />I really like the shape, the leather, and the stitching. I like it so much that I don't mind to be carrying a man purse. I like that the clutch stands on its own while I open it and get things in and out. It looks really high quality and professional and it keeps my pockets empty and my pants looking nice.<br /><br />Do not buy this if you are looking for something small that you can hide away or if you don't feel comfortable carrying a small bag.",1
4,"Nice sweater. Fit well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 140lbs and the medium was good. I usually wear a small or medium and I‚Äôm a size 6. The sleeves were actually long enough for my long arms. The slits do come up fairly high, so unless I‚Äôm wearing my high rise jeans or a tank top underneath, you do occasionally see some of my waist underneath. I have quite a long waist though, so If you are shorter this may not be an issue.",1
5,Very comfortable.  Easy to install.,1
4,"Lovely amount of nacre. Smaller than I expected, but meets lower millimeter. Could use larger back, as they turn while in ears, placing stone up or down while wearing",1
3,"Very thick for a sleeveless product, so not what I really wanted. But the quality is good however.",0
4,"Very nice slipper.  Washes well.  The price was so good, I bought 2 pair.",1
3,It was delivered almost a month late but it was great quality and the receiver of this gift absolutely loved it. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift but came the last week of January.. either way it was still really great quality if you don‚Äôt mind that it might be late,0
5,Love it..,1
4,FIT GOOD,1
2,This is a really pretty dress EXCEPT for the giant hole where you tie it. It‚Äôs a huge hole and not a flattering look. I‚Äôm tempted to try and hem it together because it‚Äôs cute otherwise,0
4,Love the socks!,1
4,"Looks exactly like the picture and because of prior reviews, I did get it two sizes bigger and it fits perfectly. It's long, just like I wanted. Very satisfied. I just wished it was a little bit thicker for the price.",1
5,wife said it is a good product even though it was larg,1
5,"Mi esposo mide 6'2"" y usa XL y le qued√≥ muy bien.",1
5,Got it as a wedding gift (something new) for my best friend and she loved it.,1
5,"Fully adjustable, great quality",1
3,Okay. For costume jewelry,0
1,It did not stick. It was a good idea but apparently there was not enough magnetic stuff to work with the lashes,0
3,Love the color! The purple is rich and dark. Appears to be well made but I would have liked to see more reinforcement around the back of the neck though. And is definitely NOT cashmere.,0
1,Product was delivered and the bow was detached from the back. I had to glue it back myself.,0
2,Inside zipper broke after a couple weeks.  If they put in quality zippers it would be well worth the money.,0
4,"I bought a size up, and it fits Ok. Comfy, and doesn‚Äôt make the rubbing noise other inexpensive hiking pants do (which I hate). Good for hiking in the heat. The waist is a bit too high. Not the most flattering, but does the job.",1
5,A beautiful  piece of jewelry at a great price !!! I ordered for a Christmas present & can not wait to give it to the girl it was bought for.,1
3,It's cute but one of the triangle earrings has a circle on it. It's dipped gold.,0
3,"This dress is very cute and made well, however, I am 5‚Äô7 and the lining was extremely too short. While I would have loved to keep this dress because the overall look and fit were as expected it was entirely too short.",0
4,"I ordered this for a costume party. The size medium dress came, very good quality but it definitely ran big. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and the hem was about 3 inches too long which that never occurs. And then I ordered a small for better fit and hoping it would be shorter.. nope! I returned both because I didn‚Äôt want to pay to have it hemmed. I see but I don‚Äôt have a sewing machine that will cut off the hem and stitch it which is needed related to the type of material. For this reason I gave it a 4 star..",1
2,La pulsera est√° exelente muy bonita pero no se puede abrochar no queda fuerte,0
4,completely shear.,1
3,"Material wise, the item was very good, soft and comfortable.  But using their size chart, the items was way too big and loose.  I probably could have gone 1-2 sizes smaller.",0
5,"De algod√≥n, son muy frescos y comodos",1
1,"I normally wear a 2x and based on the reviews saying they run small I ordered a 4x.  I received them today and we‚Äôll be lucky if they fit my mom who wears a size medium!!!!<br />They run very, very, very small!!!!",0
4,Great fit for a slim body,1
4,"runs big, love the pockets....",1
4,"Seemed a bit big for an XL, but not so big that it was a problem.",1
5,Qupid is my go-to brand! I love how their shoes fit and how supportive the heels are. I am 5' 6 1/2&#34; tall and 230lbs. and I can do my thing all day in these. I encourage all my divas to buy these!,1
4,"Initial fit was just right. After wash it was a bit snug but acceptable. Appears to be well made, durable and perfect as an outer or underwear garment . . .  bgs.",1
3,ok,0
2,"It's just ok, feels like it's plastic...<br />a bit of a struggle with the bucklels,everytime<br />you go to buckel them the straps move the opposite direction, i may return it..",0
1,Material is to cheap not worth it,0
3,Not a big fan of the seam that runs through the middle of the front. Otherwise it‚Äôs cute enough. Looks a bit cheap.,0
2,"The pattern on the back of the shirt is out of line with the front pattern, which is disappointing.  The yellow belt image and side images on the front are about 3 inches lower on the back, so the pattern isn't uniform.  It's not enough for me to return the shirt, but it is noticeable and annoying.",0
3,Nice fabric but a little to small,0
5,"Such great quality!! Highly suggest for a lightweight, cover. Not only was the fabric so flattering, but could be easily be dressed up or down. Definitely would purchase again.",1
5,Much needed medical identifier.  Some siezures are falling spells and some I cannot communicate.  This keychain says it all for me.,1
1,The button came off and there was a hole only one day after normal wear. Was super cute on but had to throw away. This dress will only last you for one use. Waste of money.,0
5,Good quality good value.,1
1,is not size large.  having major trouble getting refund. Had to place a complaint.,0
5,"Love these...simple, comfy and well priced.",1
1,The leg holes on some of the pairs are to large/don‚Äôt have enough elastic causing the underwear to ride up my sons butt and back and leave his private completely uncovered...it wasn‚Äôt all pairs but most.,0
1,"It's the worst case I've ever bought. It has a nice print but that's it. The cut outs don't accommodate for charger even. It's not a tight fit, and very thin. If it's dropped it won't protect anything. Not worth the $",0
1,"Have bought from this company before and loved them, this pair is horrible, ugly, misshapen, nasty looking, have grease on one knee, are garbage, the fit is awful, very disappointed, will make a great cleaning rag I guess",0
1,"Bad quality, srechy and somewhat too big :/ nothing like the picture",0
5,My daughter loves her pants,1
1,This was a waste of money. Do not purchase this dress because you will be disappointed. My dress is too small and it came way after the expected date,0
2,In the picture the hat looks like a formed hat. It actually has no shape to it.,0
1,I was in love til I tried on unless you have a petite neck its a no ! The scorpion pokes me in the  neck! More like a choker. Needs to be bigger width and length Will be returning.,0
3,It's really cute but kind of chintzy. It broke within 2 days but I was able put it back together fairly easily.,0
3,"I got a 3x, normally a 2x, and its pretty tight, enough so it's hard to layer. But the ""velcro"" or ""hook and loop"" are poor in quality with the fuzzy part becoming very worn out and soft and also the part that detached and hangs from the cuff thats used to adjust it, it made of some kind of semi-hard plastic/syntethic material with verylittle spiked posts, instead of it being a piece the main material with the opposite side of the velcro that's harder and sticks to the softer part of the velcro.",0
5,"I love how soft this dress is! At first I thought it wouldn't, but the top has elastic that not only holds up the dress without feeling tight, but it also holds in my chest so I don't need a bra. I love the pattern and the way it flows, making me feel sexy and carefree. It's perfect for a night out or a casual dinner with friends. I received this item for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
2,I liked the dress.,0
1,I bought these because of some good reviews. Regretting I even wasted my time looking at this item. I can't even put them on because of the curved pin - it hurts too much to try moving them around in my ear hole.  This item is literally trash,0
4,"I have been needing a new wristlet for a while, as the zipper on my last one completely failed me.  I hate using regular wallets, because they are rarely big enough for me to stuff all of my crap in, and I oftentimes like to just carry a wristlet around - no bag.  It is just more convenient that way.  Also, since I am a vegan...most of the ones labelled 'vegan-friendly' are pretty....bad.  Or expensive.  This wristlet is PU leather - not real leather, making it absolutely vegan friendly.  It comes in a variety of colors and at an affordable price as well.  It is not the most durable wristlet I have come across, but it hold everything I want it to and more and looks decent.  It pretty much checks all of the boxes for me.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
1,I ordered an xxl the pants too big and shirt too small,0
1,Does not have the correct connection for Gear watch band,0
3,"I not very happy with the item, it is a bit small; it is not like the picture",0
5,"this ring was perfect for my husband's collection .... i didn't expect it to arrive in time for christmas, but it did .... so happy",1
5,It fits perfectly!<br />My niece ‚ô• it!,1
3,"I love the keychain, but was not what I was expecting...the keychain that I received was darker and with less white on it as pictured.",0
1,Had to return,0
5,"perfect shoe, so so pretty. worth the purchase. May daughter loves it",1
5,"I purchased this locket to replace an Origami Owl locket my husband gave me that broke. So far, I'm definitely as pleased with this item as I was the higher priced Origami Owl locket! It has slightly larger stones, which I really like, but otherwise it's identical. Just at a better price! I will definitely be looking at other items by Maddie M Designs since I have been so pleased with this piece!",1
5,"So many conflicting reviews regarding size!!  I was very confused about what size to order!!<br />I ordered this dress in both the Purple color and Orange color in Size Large.  I am 64 years old, 5' 6&#34; and weigh 166.  I was pleasantly surprised both dresses fit perfectly.  I generally wear a size 12 (misses) in TJ Maxx-priced dresses.  I am &#34;pear&#34; shaped and this dress does NOT accent my larger waist and hips.  In fact, it is surprisingly flattering because it skims the problem areas.  The &#34;smocked elastic&#34; hits me right under the bust, as it should, and as shown on the model.  This is an empire waist but does not look like a maternity dress like many empire waisted dresses do.  I do not feel dumpy in this maxi like I do in most!<br />The &#34;Purple&#34; dress is a patchwork print with many, many different, lovely colors and patterns.  It has lots of blue shades, some lavender and corals.  The predominant color is not purple on my dress.  I really love the print.  The buttons and elastic button loops are a light peach color.<br />Buyer Beware:  The bodice of this dress is not going to fit if you are larger than a  36 B or small C cup because this dress will gap at the bust.  The fabric fits like silk and does not have any stretch.  It does have a  one inch placket of fabric behind the buttons and that camouflages any really tiny gaps.<br />The short sleeves fit with ample room on my rather large upper arms.<br />Some reviewers mentioned a &#34;puff&#34; on the sleeve which is true and very noticeable on the Orange dress but not on the Purple dress.  It just depends on how the gathers in the sleeves were sewn at the factory.  I do not like the &#34;puff&#34; so I'm returning the Orange dress.<br />This dress is 100% Rayon, very soft and, YES, it will be wrinkled when you get it.  It had a slight odor.  Just let it air out and press it.  I do not recommend washing or drying this dress regardless of the &#34;washing instructions&#34; because it is just too delicate and apparently will shrink (based on many reviews).  The elastic loops for the buttons seem delicate as well so don't pull too hard.  The cord tassel at the empire waist (not a drawstring) adds to the &#34;boho&#34; look and I liked it, contrary to other reviewers.  Yes, Lots of buttons but I can get the dress on and off over my head by just unbuttoning 7 buttons.<br />Length:  I am just under 5' 6&#34; and the length is just perfect!  The dress does not drag the floor on me and covers my legs.  The hem is slightly shorter in the front and a couple of inches longer in the back, shows a little ankle and buttons down to the knees.  No fear of a peep show and, although the fabric is lightweight,  it is not see through and you do not need a cami or a slip with the Purple dress.<br />It truly is a nice maxi length for a not so tall person, has a nice, fitted bodice for a not very busty person and a nice modest v-neck.  Great short sleeve for those of us who no longer wear sleeveless dresses or tops.  I bought this dress to wear to an outdoor, daytime, beachside (not in the sand!) wedding in Mexico over Labor Day and plan to wear a 2 or 3 inch casual wedge or chunky heeled sandals.",1
5,Comfy,1
2,I‚Äôm all about flowy dresses but this felt like a frumpy bag lady dress. Nothing about it feels as though it fits and therefore it adds pounds to your appearance and looks like a muumuu (even though I‚Äôm all about comfort.),0
1,"This brand, Janyasa, is a complete waste of time and i will not order from them again!  Of the 4 items i've ordered from them, all in the same size, using their specified sizing guide, i have had to return 3 items because they were SO SMALL, i couldn't get them over my head.  In all 4 instances, i ordered 3XL and had to return 3 of the outfits.  The 4th one was also tight but wearable, the other 3 were laughable as 3XL!  I urge the seller to do better quality control over the products they sell and do better with the accuracy of the sizing.  They have lost a customer for life.",0
1,It says true to size and it looks like it could fit my 8yr old son. I ordered medium n have medium sized boobs this not what I expected!!!,0
2,these are cute but doesn't stay on the face. keeps falling off :(,0
5,"Update 11/1/19<br />After a few weeks of wearing in I e changed my mind and first review of the belt. It‚Äôs sturdy and pretty near perfect in the stiffness dept. it hold my shield or kimber .45 and doesn‚Äôt give. Ratcheting belt buckle is strong and won‚Äôt accidentally come loose. I‚Äôm actually going to buy a brown leather belt to match more of my daily casual wear.<br />Try it. I did and I‚Äôm very happy I did. I know it‚Äôs not the cheapest or most expensive but it‚Äôs pretty darn close to perfect.<br />It‚Äôs the black leather with carbon fiber buckle.<br /><br />Ok so I bought this newly because the edc of weighted item made my other belts sag and I was constantly shifting my iwb  holster around. This belt is stiff, not as stiff as advertised or maybe as stiff as other reviewers say it is but definitely more sturdy than a good leather belt. At $62 I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again. I‚Äôve adjusted it and it fits well and looks nice, feels solid and secure, it is a nice quality belt but this is a review after only having it in a few hours on day one.... I‚Äôd recommend it as a beginner belt but if you carry a heavier piece I‚Äôd buy the higher up version.",1
3,"It is a little hard to slide on back of earring, but it works.",0
5,Arrived as promised.,1
5,I was going to use it for new year's. I hope I get the other one I ordered and my shoes.,1
1,Magnet for money clip is two week to hold more than two bills down and I would trust it to stay with a buck in it. Narrow card slots. Cheap material. Got a similar higher quality wallet at Wilson's leather for same price.,0
5,Great necklace with nice colors.,1
4,"Took a few tries the first time to get it adjusted perfectly, frustrating because I had to take it off all the way to pull it back through.<br />They worked great, I bought 4. Love that I only need one for each bag.",1
3,"Fits great, flowy and comfortable. Quality slightly poor.... Peices of threading coming apart.",0
2,"Bought these for a dance recital costume and was super disappointed. Despite the size running small and quality not the best if you actually wanted to wear them outside, I was mostly upset because the white gloves are actually cream.",0
5,Sweet!!!  Can't ask for much more in a Goretex shell pant.  If the straps fall off the shoulders just cross them in the front,1
5,I read it was sharp and painful to wear. It doesn't hurt at all. And it's lovely. The corners are a little bit sharp but it doesn't really hurt anything. I have very long hair so it pulled my hair when I wore it on my right hand. No biggie. I wear it on my left hand now. Lol problem solved. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç,1
5,I wish they had size 5T,1
1,Wrong size,0
2,"You get what you pay for, obviously a rip off from the more expensive one I saw online.<br />Runs very small, I wear a small in everything and this one makes me look like I‚Äôm pregnant. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 118lbs)",0
5,pretty unique  looking,1
1,"One pair had a missing screw when it arrived. One pair cracked a lens two days later. Cannibalized a screw from to fix the first broken pair, but the nose piece fell of later that day. Third pair still good after two weeks.",0
5,Bello y buena calidad. !!,1
5,This works great fur a Nepeta cosplay hat just tuck the ear flaps and paint the face,1
1,It looks great in pics but when it came in the mail it was huge,0
1,"The dark brown picture that is shown is NOT accurate. They will send you a light brown belt. When I asked to return the item, they refused and said that the description says &#34;brown&#34;. I am not satisfied with this purchase.",0
3,Love the watch but the volume is too low and the band is very weak,0
2,"This set is very brightly colored but the gold is too much, it cheapens the look because it comes across a bit gawdy.",0
1,"The hat was as expected in size and appearance BUT Nickerson's shipped it in a reusable plastic bag and the crown was crushed and the brim twisted on arrival.  Is it too much to expect that a broad brimmed, stiff hat be shipped in a box?",0
3,I bought the shirt for compression as my bicep fell.  The arms have very little compression.,0
2,"I wouldn't wear these out of the house.  So thin even though the cut on the leg is right.<br /> Medium is a bit big around the middle.  Just super cheap, sloppy feeling lounge pants is how I would describe them.  And they look maternity.",0
4,Bien bello,1
2,"The elastic is so tight that my toddlers heel can't even go all the way back in the shoe. It pushes her toes into the front of the shoes. However, even though its so tight, it's not tight enough to keep her from losing the shoe. Don't recommend.",0
4,"Item matches photo. Cute charm, but a little hard to read as the black was off center a little bit.",1
5,they are super cute,1
4,"A nice set of chains...Mainly got for the paperclip which is nice and on par with a necklace I paid a lot more for. The Gucci link one is nice but one side is curved so you have to wear it a certain direction out or it looks strange. The figaro is nice but my least favorite of the three. Overall, happy with these.",1
2,"I was over the moon to get this umbrella, it will save my sensitive skin from the sun! but alas, as i used it every day there are now holes in it where the joints of the umbrella are and i'm so disappointed! i really thought that i was getting a quality umbrella that would last for a long time and it's been less than 6 months and now i need another one. if you are using this as a once in a while umbrella then this is a good product but if you are going to use it daily as i do then it's not for you.",0
1,"Got a small. I'm 5'3&#34; 120lbs and the legs are too long and the torso is too short. Waist has a draw string but the hips are too wide so it's not form fitting as it appears in the picture. If you're pear shaped and you love your big thighs and don't have a muffin top, this will fit you",0
1,Does not work like the ad says. A complete fail,0
3,I hate when an underwear has too large and long of a &#34;V&#34; also the cut makes the band go square across the butt making the butt look squarish and not round. Also kinda a spandex material... not terrible but they could do better.,0
5,"This dress is very flattering and super comfortable.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 120lbs and got a medium.  It fits perfectly.",1
2,The screw ball wouldn‚Äôt stay in place,0
4,Need to lose some more weight so it looks more flattering but excited! Wish it was not cotton material. Afraid it may shrink.,1
1,Broken when they came.,0
3,"It's cute, however not true to size. I'm 5'4 and generally an xl. Ordered an xl and it fit, but was snug in the crotch area.<br />Also the ears are placed more like Yoda, not a bear.<br />Onesie you buy, fit it does not.",0
5,Nice shoes,1
3,Meh. Basic caveman outfit. Pants too large. Package DOES NOT include inflatable club despite product description specifically mentioning as included. Not worth the price but I will keep it to use a scraps and pieces for a more tailored caveman costume using other items already in my costuming collection.,0
5,This is a really pretty dress. I've gotten compliments when I've worn it. Perfect for work! (I'm a teacher). Definitely recommend!,1
2,Very thin material. Tore the cargo pocket when I tried to put my wallet in.,0
4,Quality is OK. Sizing is small. The Towel needs to thicker. These robes are used by kids at the pool.<br />The belt loop at the back is missing. Need 3 loops minimum for kids robes.<br />Color was nice. Cloth is soft. Hood is great.<br />Size 10 (10yr) is more of size 8 (for 8 yr olds.),1
2,Maybe in Asia this is an X-Large not in the USA!,0
5,"There's nothing to dislike about the item, I use this pants for work.",1
1,"Not worth the money, and not the item I thought I was buying",0
5,I am sooo satisfied! I'm a huge fan and have been wanting a cosplay costume for some time now and finally got one.  I've been waiting for the perfect one and this was It! It fits perfectly. Needless to say I'm in love. My 5 year old wants to be chibi usa for Halloween so I'll be purchasing hers from dazcos as well.,1
2,This is a cheaply made black one that is not leather as described. I ordered 2 and the brown one is much nicer and even came in different packaging.,0
2,"These 2XL slippers were supposed to fit a Man's size 14.  I couldn't;t even begin to put them on, they were so small.  Fortunately, my wife thought they were cute and fit  her OK - she's a Woman's size 9.  So Buyer Beware on the size quoted!",0
5,Love them! So cute! I ordered a half size bigger after reading comments but i wish I stuck to my original size. I am going to have to get pads so my foot does not fall out while I walk. But I love them and don't have time for an exchange!,1
4,Cute dress but it way to big I order a large and had to return I were 8,1
5,"The friendly little fellows were stocking stuffers for my son and son-in-law. Humor aside, these were bigger than I expected, very clean and had no odor - a much better choice than the tourist-trap versions...",1
4,"Love this heart shirt!  It does run small, so order a size up!",1
5,To place an order was extremely easy to use.  I item arrive in a timely fashion and Item works perfectly.,1
1,Way too big for my face which is small. Gave them away to teenagers down the street,0
5,it looks just like on the computer i am sure my granddaughter will love them,1
3,Would like a new one,0
5,need to loose weight,1
5,I ordered a medium bc all the reviews I read said it runs big. The coat is cute!,1
5,"It was very small for the size, especially in the arms, but got it returned and a bigger size ordered with no problem at all. Shipping was quick too!",1
1,Not at all like the photo. Dress is too large and way too long. Pockets are down by my lower thighs. Really poorly made.,0
3,The shirt runs a little small but I like more room in my t shirts,0
3,"Good fit, well packed and nice style.",0
5,My daughter loved this.,1
5,Made a great gift and she loves it.,1
1,Cheap item. It stained my skin.,0
1,"not well made, fit was poor and short!",0
1,I ordered a 40B but it fit as 38C terrible uncomfortable too. Don't waste your money,0
3,I liked how the picture showed lines 0f multiple colors of turquoise.  these are just one solid color,0
2,Too small for my head.  But nice,0
2,"Great looking out of the package. Really felt durable and heavy duty, but I put these in my daughter‚Äôs softball cleats and after 4 games, the left lace shredded. Disappointed, to say the least.",0
5,"This is a great buckle. The fit was excellent and it looks perfect with my gold case watch. But I had to stop wearing it and now I'm looking for another replacement gold buckle for my watch, which is hard considering the small vintage size. The problem? This buckle is not nickel free. I was hoping the coating would protect my wrist from any found in the metal, but that isn't the case. Still broke out in a bad rash. Nowhere does this say nickel free, but like I said, I was hoping the coating would act as a buffer. So no stars off.",1
3,It fit really large. wish there were size options,0
2,Way too big! Need an extra small for an option,0
5,These socks are so cute and my grandsons loved all the designs and i love the grippers on the bottom!!,1
2,The pendant is nice but I wanted something smaller. The big negative to this piece of jewelry is that the chain is way too thin to support the pendant.  My chain was in knots which I didn't want to try to get out.  I was afraid I would break the chain if I were to try to get those knots out.,0
5,"I love these socks! They are adorable! They go just above my daughters knees, slip a little under when she‚Äôs running or playing, but hold up pretty well. I love the variety of color for the price. She gets tons of compliments when we go out. Definitely do and would recommend to anyone.‚ò∫Ô∏è",1
2,"This hat is very pretty, however it is very small.",0
5,Love!! Many compliments,1
1,Should have sold for $10. Poor quality. Cheap materials.,0
2,I ordered a medium after reading the reviews and it‚Äôs still too big. I normally wear a 10-12 And this fits like an extra extra large. I wish I could make it work but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to return it. Not sure what to order now‚Ä¶,0
4,Great fit and comfort. They did start to fall apart a bit at the seam after a few watches but they are still in one peice and function well.  They also delivered quickly.,1
5,So fun! Open season on Jane Seymour.,1
2,Well made but not XL. Ordered an XL and received items that are more like a size M. I wear a size large/16-18 in tops.,0
3,Need to keep them wiped off to keep shine,0
5,"This isn't my first Russell Athletic sweatshirt nor will it be my last, for obvious reasons it fits well wears great and hasn't pilled yet. Its warm and comfortable when wearing a short or long sleeve tee shirt.",1
3,Fantastic gifts for party bags,0
5,I was pleasantly surprised with the durability and sturdiness of this item. Looks better in person as well.,1
5,Love the design but the fabric layer inside clings to my nose when I breathe and it's a bit big,1
5,I purchased this item for my daughter to elevate her tube dress to the next level. I must say this sweater was exactly as I visualized. Minor con; some of the strings shredded. Other than that she was the rave of the masquerade birthday event.,1
5,"This gown is unbelievably gorgeous for the money! Only problem is it's made for a giant...way way too long and I am 5'11""! Prepare to have it hemmed if you order. I was sad to return it's so beautiful.",1
4,Loved the sweater. Went perfect with my dress. The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because when I took it out of the bag there was already a snag in the fabric :( but still loved it :),1
3,"Very cute, but the colors I got weren't what are pictured.  I received a dark brown, black and taupe pair.  I really wanted the cream color they are showing but I guess they decided I wanted chocolate brown instead.  Anywho, they are very cute but as the other reviewers have said, they tear easily and within 1 wear had to throw one set away.",0
3,You get what you pay for. More of a novelty item than for serious wear.,0
4,Ordered a s a gift.  Very nice!,1
1,"I loved the look and fit.  Unfortunately, after wearing one time it started falling apart.  I am so disappointed.  I can not believe how quickly it fell apart I only had it on for two hours and had to take it off.  DO NOT BUY!",0
1,Absolutely nothing like the picture. Terrible. So disappointed.,0
2,"It is comfortable but leaky on rainy days!!!  I have two Olive shoes, one in brown and one is back.  I like the design and fits well.  But it should have done good job with wafer proof.  Not wearing on rainy days.",0
5,Best jumper I ever got. Dresss up or dress down,1
4,"Band too big for my wrist. I expected to have to stretch it to get it on, and then it would stay in place.  But instead, I can slip it on easily, and it flops around on my wrist.",1
1,Washed under the sink with a sponge and all the reflective shield peeled off. Wouldn‚Äôt buy these,0
5,"I let my grand daughter wear my hat outside. My husband saw her from the window and said that he thought perhaps sunglasses would be useful. But, that is part of the reason why I love my hat, as I walk in the woods a lot and am comforted in knowing I will not be mistaken as an animal by a hunter. And it is easy to identify my granddaughter at the park. I wear a small cap underneath in case it gets too hot.",1
2,Too small doesn‚Äôt fit according to size chart. It‚Äôs off about 2 sizes. I wear a small 4/6 everywhere and I would of needed a large for this to fit.,0
5,"Great BDU shorts, probably the best I have owned.",1
3,It Shrunk when I washed it‚Ä¶,0
5,Love the dress.,1
1,The bracelets are not even rainbow.  Half of them were pastel and the others either didn't include all the colors a rainbow should have or were missing a color or two.  SO disappointed.  These should not be listed as &#34;Gay Pride Bracelets&#34; if they aren't even rainbow.,0
5,Product came exactly as advertised and is so soft. So much cheaper than buying from the barstool sports site.,1
5,Very comfortable and light weight.  Fits perectly.,1
5,Love these socks. They are very comfortable and well made. Just the right thickness for me.,1
5,"I loved this dress. It was super comfy and not too long, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3. It was very soft and cute.",1
3,It wears out as the day passes and bags out a bit. The letters do start to come off as its washed. The one pictured isnt what came but it was still pink and said the same thing.,0
3,I normally wear a 3x or 4x but had to get a 5x to get it to fit. I‚Äôm  5‚Äò8‚Äú And will have to hem to wear it so I don‚Äôt trip (I sew so it‚Äôs not a big deal but if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd be returning it). I got the navy blue and while it‚Äôs a pretty blue it‚Äôs most definitely not dark or navy blue. All that said it‚Äôs an ok dress for $25.,0
5,Beautiful bracelet' I just love it. It looks so expensive' very sturdy' beautiful purple color' I am just in' Awe!!!,1
1,Does not fit nicely on the top. The slit was in an odd spot at the bottom of my leg,0

1,"Purchased item, looks nice! Pin and spring clip came apart within 1 week of use. Seems like a problem most people experiencing. I would welcome a refund if possible?",0
2,I thought this was an earring cuff for the middle of the ear...good quality and fast delivery.,0
1,"This will not fit a 17"" laptop as they claim. It would work for a 15"" but a 17"" will not fit and for the price you pay it should be a for go that they check these things.<br />Well 3 months in and the pos has fallen apart. Zippers fell off, all the threads are coming undone. Do not believe the 5 star reviews as they have not had theirs long enough to see it disintegrate.",0
4,"This chain is pretty and delicate in appearance and the exact size I needed for a charm.  The closure is a little difficult to open & close, but just because it is small.",1
1,"Have ordered the white version twice, and have been sent a black shirt twice...<br /><br />So I would NOT recommend the short if you want it in white, but WOULD recommend it if you want it in black no matter what color you choose.",0
1,Sent it back. Fit was horrible and terribly difficult to put on.,0
5,I've been wearing this constantly since I purchased it. It is just the right size and looks perfect on.,1
4,These earrings are good. The pearls are bigger in person than it looked in the pictures. I expected it to be a little smaller. Other wise the earrings are pretty.,1
1,Lasted less than a week of gentle use.,0
5,My daughter surprised me with this bracelet and we both wear one. Love it.,1
4,It was a present Mom liked it.,1
5,"I bought these bracelets for a friend of mine. I decided to buy this particular product because I saw that it came with two bracelets, black and white beads. And these colors are regularly used colors so they go very well with most of her outfits. I also love that the beads are on a stretchy string. Although she is not heavy, it is nice to have that flexibility in case she wants to share the bracelet with someone. The beads look like they are good quality and sturdy. You can wear them separately or together. I also love that they came with a nice black mesh bag. So when I am not using them I have a nice little bag to store them in.<br /><br />I am rating this product five stars out of five stars.<br /><br />Please make sure to look at my attached photos to see the packaging and the bracelets. I have included a ruler so you can see the size.<br /><br />Comment below if I forgot anything so I can try to answer any of your questions based on my experience. Have a nice day.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my review. This discount did not affect my thoughts, evaluation of this item or the review I have posted.

1,Cheaply made and really expensive for what you get. Better options for camo hats than this.,0
1,"This garment is sooooooo badly sized I can't believe it!  In fact, I must say that I repeatedly run into this problem with clothes bought on Amazon.  I contend that this dress, in any shop in America would be labeled &#34;medium&#34; and a rather scant medium at that.<br />I just keep wondering why it is so hard to create a standard size chart so that the clothes we buy on line, and can't try on.  It is CRAZY!",0
3,"I saw this coming across my Vine feed and have always been curious about these gaiters with ear holes. I don't care to cover my ears with a regular gaiter unless it's cold, which isn't often here. So I decided to give it a try.<br />The color is nice, it looks a bit lighter in pictures, but it's actually a charcoal gray color. The length is good. There's enough to rest around the neck but not too much that it strangles you. The ear holes are just under the top hem, as high as they can be.<br />Putting on the gaiter, though, it feels like the top rim is sitting too high. It naturally falls right across the bottom of my eye and rubs along my eyelid. If I pull it down below that it pulls down on the top of my ear. Add to that, it's already very snug for a gaiter. A little snugness is good but this smashes my nose toward my face.<br />My wife tried it on and it fit her a little better but still sat fairly high on her face in the front.<br />Maybe this would be good for a person in their teens, or a petite lady, but I doubt I'll be wearing this for any length of time.",0
5,"We had these bands for about 6 weeks, when the wires began to stick out of the band!!! I notified the company & asked for a refund.  THEY REFUNDED MY MONEY WITHIN 24 HOURS!!!  GREAT RESPONSE!",1
5,This is a beautiful necklace. Very well made and lots of bling. Not to mention the case it comes in makes it feel extra special. I highly reccomend this.,1
2,Flakes. Does not work well. Lashes did not stick all day.,0
5,Super cute for any outfit and fit great. Stretchy,1
5,Appreciate how quickly this arrived. Also very sturdy,1
5,Comfort and very flexible,1
2,"Very cute, but had a sad little girl cause they sent the wrong size. I double checked I put the right size and they sent a different size than what I ordered. Tried to contact someone about it but never heard back. Very disappointing",0
1,"Is much shorter than I expected, and fit is not what I was expecting.",0
4,The size I ordered was a little big for me. I normally order a size up in dresses due to my butt being so big but I recommend buying your normal size because it‚Äôs actually pretty long. I definitely would recommend this dress for any event great for the price. It is a little see through but some underwear and bra will do the trick. Also the zipper would get a little stuck but if you order the right size I think this dress is a great deal! And looks very nice!,1
1,This is not the quality it appears to be in the photo on Amazon. The blue color is lighter and the O and the L are smaller than the other letters and the polish finish is not nearly as nice. The metal is actually kind of rough on the surface.,0
2,Received many compliments on the look of this watch. Only problem is the watch band rips to easily. Only had it for a couple months and just ended up replacing it with a new watch.,0
5,Given as a gift. Loved it.,1
1, ,0
5,"Very nice quality , could even dress up.  The color ‚Äúroyal blue‚Äù is actually navy blue but I knew that from picture and ordered them on purpose.  Just want to be sure no one expects royal blue,  Wish they came in more colors: red, aqua,  taupe would all be nice.and real royal blue",1
1,Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture,0
3,Runs very small,0
5,Ordered the coral color. Flattering but still loose enough to not be skin tight. Get lots of compliments on it.,1
5,Very content with the product,1
5,Love it!,1
3,"I really love the print and fit but I am a little disappointed because right in the front about 4 inches below waistline, it has the letters HC ? I'm not sure why? It's kind of an eye sore.",0
5,Great bathing suit for a Disney princess fan.,1
5,great shirt. fits well,1
2,Not as pictured. Wide and long and ill fitted.,0
5,Stunning,1
5,After the time changed we found ourselves walking in the dark more than we wanted to cars came too close. I put a key ring loop on a string and clipped one of these on and our dog thought this was great! He loves trotting to make them swing and when he stops he smells where the light is. I think he thinks this light beam smells like fresh grass!,1
4,"I ordered the blue & love them.  Fit is true to size.  Not any arch support, but can be added.  Fringe hangs a bit long.  Shipping was a little slow‚Ä¶took 3+ weeks.  Rubber soles & flat.  Pictures are deceiving‚Ä¶.sort of looks like a wedge bootie..not so.  Price is good except shipping charges are too high.",1
5,"Seems about average quality for the price I paid. There is a liner on the inside so it doesn't feel scratchy, but there was a little gap at the bottom. My niece has not expressed any discomfort with it however, and it holds her dresses up well.",1
3,It‚Äôs not a wine red. It‚Äôs red and very light weight. Like a T-shirt,0
5,Used this dress for my civil marriage. I absolutely loved it!! It fit perfectly! Ordered a size 4. Great quality for reasonable price.  Most likely ordering it in a different color in the future.,1
5,Fits my husband well. Very durable and true to size.,1
1,This is probably the worst item that I purchased from Amazon.  It does not look like the dress pictured. The sticthing is horrible with threads hanging from the armholes and hem. Don't waste your money on this item!,0
3,Nice tank but loses its shape a little after washing,0
5,Cool.,1
1,"Bummed!<br />Just got these today and they would have been perfect, except they don't match .....",0
5,"Very nice leather case, I used it through all my travel through Europe.",1
1,"waste of money , very thin inside and out . Tried them out on a cruise after a night of dancing , my feet where sore for several days !!!",0
2,"The material is great. It's stretchy and comfortable. But, the straps are loose. I wore it and while putting it on my wrist the strap snapped off and the watch fell. My Movado watch face only got a scratch but it could have broke.",0
5,Just right...arrived on time.,1
5,Muy bonito,1
3,The color is very different than as it appears on the website.  Also the style  and the make are not as nice as other Stella McCartney's sports tops that I bought from Luisaviaroma site. Not sure if the makers are different,0
3,thank you,0
5,"Love the fact my son can put his shoes on, on his own without a battle or assistance! Tying shoe laces has been a challenge...",1
1,The band wouldn't snap into my gear fit 2.,0
4,Good thank u,1
3,The pants is way too long,0
5,"I love these!  They are small, but the size is listed in the title, and they are perfect for my second holes.  I didn't find the wire to be too short, although I can see how people would find it an issue if they were planning to wear it in their lobes.  I also didn't have the issue some other people listed, about the earrings catching on fabric, and I haven't taken these off since I got them (about a week).<br /><br />I particularly like these for my second holes because they match so well with any other earring style I'd want to wear.  These earrings are great to just leave in and add a bit of shine, even when you're not trying to be too fancy.",1
1,"great functional use but I'm worried it will fall apart quickly as the material looks cheap and reminds me of the foam sheets kids use in elementary school art projects<br /><br />update: it's been a few months and it is falling apart, which is really dumb because I keep it in my backpack all the time and only use it to store my drivers license and ID card for school",0
3,Very little stretch. Had to send back.,0
5,I ordered these in a small and literally was afraid they would be too little however I exercise ALOT so I figured eventually I would get into them. They were extremely tight and after my workout they are soaked which means they are definitely working in my favor. Its been 1 month and I really need a XS Ihave lost many inches in my inner thighs. Wish they came in XS....,1
4,item was a bit smaller than expected but still so cute!,1
5,"When my sister saw me wearing mine, she asked for one. Now we have matching rings. Very cute.",1
1,Crappy material. Crappy fit. Straight to the trash. Very disappointed and honestly really annoyed I spent money on this.,0
5,I love them!!,1
5,They fit perfectly and keep my hands warm and dry,1
1,Had to return-didn't work. The battery is probably dead but I am not paying for a new battery in a watch I've never worn. Disappointing/angry.,0
5,Fit perfect and is just what I beeded,1
4,"Sturdy bag, attached well and good quality.",1
4,These shoes are so cute,1
3,gave it three stars because it is cute.  I bought it for a 3 year old who is small for her age and it was still small.  Order up!!,0
3,Runs very small.,0
5,Love love this anklet it is beautiful,1
3,I was disappointed that they were way too small. But the refund was done with no issues,0
3,"I ordered this and returned it. 5 stars to the seller, they replaced it due to the elastic being broken on the top of tube top. But the item replaced had areas of threading undone. Just kept it even though it's slightly defective. I also ordered it in black that fits perfect! The white one is a little smaller in fit.",0
1,The product I received was not at all what was pictured. The material was not a lightweight cotton but rather a stiff and cheap material. Arms were 3/4 length and the overall length of the sweater was short. Definitely not off the shoulder/slouchy as pictured. I returned the item.,0
5,I got the wrong size .. but it fit my co workers watch . Do I have it to her,1
3,I'm like a size 5/6 and I ordered a medium. Sizing wasnperfect but the picture makes it look like the tie sits further down the torso. Mine was right under my bust so it gave me maternity vibes and wasnt the look I was going for cuz honey I am not pregnant,0
4,Pleased,1
5,"It's a much bolder pink than in the photo, but it's a beautiful bag.",1
5,My daughter and her boyfriend dressed up as Lola and Bugs for Halloween. They were adorable! They wore the jerseys multiple times and there were no problems. They do fit a little large but we tied them in the back so it was an easy fix.,1
5,"This men's thermal shirt is a pretty nice quality shirt.  I bought it for my boyfriend, and even though it's fairly light weight, it fits him nicely and feels great.  It's made from 100% cotton, but I ordered his usual size Med, and it fits great.  There aren't loose strings hanging off it or anything, it's a very nice quality and he highly recommends it.  It's not the warmest thermal shirt, but it's a great option for layering.  I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
5,Product is really cute and loved the freebie it came with!,1
5,"They fit me. they seem well made. I couldn't find bedroom slippers that I liked, fit me, and seemed well made at Costco, Walmart, and Burlington. So, I spent a bit more. We'll see how they are in six months.",1
1,they lasted 2 weeks and my feet came though the bottom.more junk,0
1,Followed the instructions and still was misshaped metal is way to soft.,0
5,This cloth works miracles! I just finished cleaning my vintage trumpet and the results were just amazing! I will definitely purchase another one. Highly recommended for all silver musical instruments!,1
1,Colors do not match picture<br /> Material is different than described and see through,0
2,Cheap feel and look and too big,0
5,i love this so much perfect for the beach to dress it up,1
5,"A gorgeous, flowy dress that I am so glad to have purchased.",1
3,I‚Äôm sorry to say they don‚Äôt glow in the dark. I‚Äôm very disappointed in them!,0
5,Love them,1
4,Items ran a bit small,1
3,They are so bright and sparkling.  The stone fell out the first day I tried to wear them. I was able to put it back in due to the wires being so flexible. I don't expect them to last long so I will enjoy the sparkle while it lasts.,0
5,Love it- bought it in two colors and would buy in more if they had different colors to choose from.,1
3,Dress tie dyed but had a obvious black dye stain in upper front of it.,0
4,"Very pretty. Glad I read the reviews where people said it was made for a slender wrist. I have a slender wrist and rarely am able to wear bracelets for that reason. This one fits well. It's lovely. Only downsides: It  sometimes turns inside-out on my wrist, so the back side is displayed. It also can catch on fine fabrics, so take care if wearing with a dress that could be snagged.",1
1,"product didn't even last 6 months, what a shame disappointing",0
5,Perfect size,1
5,"It's not that big, fit my 10 year old perfectly. He wore it the second day after receiving it!! Looks cool on him!",1
3,Nice and comfortable,0
3,"Like the lift and that it‚Äôs comfortable; however, started ripping near the shoulder/clasp band within 2 weeks.",0
1,Very cheap material.,0
5,Love these shoes. I bought them for my mother and she absolutely loved them.,1
3,So cute the colors are amazing. my only concern is that they shed ALOT... I have a lot of leg warmers especially furry ones and these are the only ones  that shed. but love the colors!!,0
5,"This is a sweatshirt - yay - thin, but enough for warmth.  The picture is so creative and beautiful!  Aslan forever!!!",1
2,"The skirt fit as expected but it was too short. The pictured length is a bit misleading. I know it said mini but if you have any sort of hips or behind, you should definitely be prepared to pair it with some tights.",0
3,I loved this dress. But one time on low heat in dryer and the tule puckered and ripped. Don‚Äôt put it in the dryer!!!,0
5,"This jumpsuit is absolutely perfect for a date night/ girls night out/ event outfit! I went with the small (5‚Äô4 131 lbs) and it fits PERFECT. It‚Äôs not too snug around the belly area (I was nervous for this) and the material is thick and well made! I tried it on really quick, and I pulled it on (didn‚Äôt notice a zipper) so if you are hippy, I‚Äôd go up a size. The top fits perfect/ don‚Äôt need to wear a bra if you don‚Äôt want to, the material is that thick. I‚Äôll probably go with a sticky strapless, though! Perfect length- can wear flats, wedges, or heels (I usually have the problem of having jumpsuits way too long) the ONLY ‚Äúnegative‚Äù and really, I‚Äôm not too upset bc it‚Äôs a perfect jumpsuit, is that the color is a turquoise, not the green in the picture. But, I love it!! A must buy!!!",1
2,"This would have been very lovely, had it fit. The fabric is a little stiff and polyester like but it is very cute for the price. Just Way way way too small.",0
3,I would give this a full 5 stars but the pockets started to come undone before the second wash! Cute and comfy but a little cheaply make unfortunately,0
5,The add says it ran a little small...so i went up a size and am very please with the fit as well as the style,1
5,They are so pretty. Love them. They feel like cotton and nothing else.,1
2,The fabric is just weird.  Not at all like I expected.,0
1,"Ordered a 9 but way to large and was very loose on foot when tied tight, wasn‚Äôt happy with quality they were bent up pretty bad. Super thin material when they said fur inside but wasn‚Äôt.",0
1,Smaller than described. I returned them.,0
5,I'm a marathon runner and this is my second pair of Adrenaline GTS 15s! I was so happy with them that I searched long and hard to find the 15s and not the 16s. So happy to have found a pair!,1
5,"Get lots of compliments, love it, quick delivery.",1
5,They are awesome great product,1
1,"Way too small, and I ordered a large",0
3,These are adorable. Although I will say they feel a bit cheap. They run a little large as well. My daughter is rather petite so I got her a size smaller and it was still a little big. Still cute though.,0
5,Love everything about this item. Super cute!,1
4,Adorable and my daughter loves them.,1
5,Was for my husband.  He loves the way it fits on his ears and keeps the wind off.,1
1,Says it want fog your glasses thats a lie also if you have a small face it will slide.,0
2,"I am now wondering if this is a knock off The North Face.  When I received it, I of course wanted to try it on.<br /> My usual size is a small/medium but wanting an oversized this time I went with a large.  I am not joking when I said it took all my effort to get it over my head, and I am not big at all, and neither is my head.  I seriously about had a panic attack after it was on because it was that tight around my neck!  I do buy The North Face products often and have never had one of their items fit like this so maybe it is a knockoff.  Otherwise, it is very pretty, soft and well made.  Since I tried it on and make up got on it, I kept it and thought maybe I would try cutting it under the chin so I can try not turning blue while wearing it.",0
4,Love the hat.  Price is steep for what you get though.  Used as a gift for summer interns who ground fish in a laboratory for their summer break.,1
1,Nothing like the photo in terms of how it fits. So disappointed,0
5,Love these! Fit my heels nicely and really helped from sinking into the grass.,1
1,Awkward crop length and baggy.,0
1,Not at all safe to put through your ear. Sharp and rough.,0
3,"OK, I have been using these sunglasses for a while now, it is time to review.<br />These are good for being in the sun and are 400 UV. It is advertised as polarized, but it is not polarized, so you will get glare, I did the polarize test and also took them to Oppenheimer's for them to check.  Don't get me wrong, I really like them a lot and use them for general use when I am out side. I have used them for driving and they do not stop glare bouncing off other cars or glare on the water so I use the driving glasses I purchased at the other place that is polarized and anti glare.",0
5,"They are soft, they are really comfy my daughter likes her slippers.",1
4,My husband enjoyed it!,1
5,Fits great and very comfortable. I just ordered it again in pink and black. Ordered a large (size 12-14) - fits great and loose enough.,1
2,"The material was very thin, and felt like costume-type material.",0
5,Pretty and well made. Used for earrings.,1
5,This arrived a couple days ago tried it onPerfect fit and definitely warm,1
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS BAND. I'VE RECEIVED 2 WITH NO WAY TO ATTACH IT TO MY WATCH. THE PEICE IS MISSING AGAIN.,0
5,I‚Äôve lost about 3 so far because they fell off but for the money it‚Äôs worth it. I love bb and the fact that they glow in the dark is amazing!,1
3,Pants were an inch and a half longer than identical pants of exact same size... Either mislabeled or incorrectly cut. Had to return.,0
5,Good quality so far!,1
1,"This bag is cheaply made. Worst of all the handles are too short, so short that my small hands cannot fit around them and this is without filling the bag with clothes!  The only remedy I can think of is to see if I can find long shoulder straps and sew them onto this bag. Waste of money.",0
4,Runs small. Great to wear under tunic or the like or by itself. The dolphin gray is a beautiful color.,1
1,"Price inexpensive quality cheap, bill of hat is dirty. Worst purchase ever made. Thankfully Amazon will refund.",0
2,Looks great but not true to size....need to order next size up,0
5,"The material feels so good, it‚Äôs thick material that will hold everything in place while<br />You work out.<br /><br />I love that it‚Äôs a matching set that comes together!<br /><br />I don‚Äôt think it really emphasizes my hips or butt in anyway, but that‚Äôs okay. The material is great in a sense that I am not suffocating becajse it‚Äôs too tight or there‚Äôs not enough give in the stretch .<br /><br />I love it, I would definitely order more colors!!!",1
2,"I decided to purchase a larger size after reading the reviews. I went for this since several others said it was very long and lightweight.  I am 5'9 and about 200lbs, thick in the thigh and booty area. This 2x barely fit over my booty and was tight around that area and very big on the top. I was going to return it, but am going to give it to my sister to see if it fits her since we have different shapes but are both tall.",0
5,Great shirt - fits perfect but wish it was a little less expensive.,1
1,"This did not fit my Apple Watch at all. One side was much too loose, the other side was too tight. I got the one for my specific watch but I think it was just poorly made. Would not recommend",0
1,This product feel apart after the first wash. Save your money. Don‚Äôt buy. I was very disappointed.,0
1,I don‚Äôt even want to give these 1 star it‚Äôs says the are surgical steel which I had in my lip and did fine. The moment I put these in I woke up with a huge lump under the ball part I figured maybe I just irritated it but the bumps just kept coming. Put my original one back in and is fine!,0
5,Luv it,1
1,"gloves gave me a rash all over my hands, attempted to return them, to much trouble and cost more to return them than to just throw them away.",0
3,"It overall looked great, but it runs pretty small. I would size up if I were to buy again. The zipper is also very cheaply made. And the fabric tears easily, causing many holes throughout the dress.",0
5,A beautiful color and a perfect fit!,1
3,Quality was just ok but it is cute,0
5,I couldn't believe how my body rocked this! I was scared because I'm a little thick. But day-um!!!! This is on point!,1
4,These are cute. They run a little small though.,1
2,"Really cute. However I like wearing the strap and it holds onto the suit with a metal piece. For the love of God, it digs into your skin. Looked into having it sewn on permanently. Told that swim material is tricky to sew and it may look uneven due to the size of the straps.",0
3,When this sweatshirt comes out of the drier there‚Äôs a hair brush worth of hair and lint stuck to it. It‚Äôs so gross. And it won‚Äôt all come off.  This was my first Northface purchase and I am really disappointed in the quality for the price.<br /><br />I am 5‚Äô 168 and I purchased a large. It‚Äôs only slightly baggy. I could‚Äôve sized down for a more fitted look.,0
5,loved then they look so cool and fit well definitely recommend,1
3,Way too large and I bought the small. Cute concept.,0
2,"[[VIDEOID:b97fa78f95632f956bb331852a461d33]] I purchased the wallet in October 2017. By December the wallet began fraying at the CARs slots from insertion and removal of my credit cards.<br /><br />I contacted them through Amazon and they did an outstanding job resolving my issue. Quick responses to the emails and they quickly replaced the wallet.<br /><br />As far as the quality, I guess that you receive what you pay for. Love the size and fit but t doesn‚Äôt appear that it‚Äôs made for any reasonable longevity.<br /><br />Update July 2018. After just a few months with the replacement wallet and the credit card pockets seams are all ripping out again.<br /><br />You would think that at any price that you could get a year out of it.<br /><br />Try other options.",0
1,Beautiful piece but was delivered broken. Sadly have to return this. Not sure if I would reorder considering it‚Äôs so fragile,0
1,Horrible cheap quality. The pants are ridiculously small and look nothing like the picture,0
5,I Love Love Love this dress,1
1,Super flimsy.,0
3,Cleary not designed with large people in mind.,0
1,Very small snoods a waste of my money would not recommend them.,0
3,It vomesbin parts & is held together with double sided tape. Its super flimsy. Not what we expected. My daughter was disappointed it comes apart so easily.,0
1,Soft material but it's not grey it's a teal blue and the ends aren't hemmed they are just cut off,0
5,Very comfy. Good material. Not too thin.,1
1,Hard to keep on the ear,0
5,Very nice! Thank you!,1
5,"These socks are awesome!! Recently finished chemo treatments and doctor recommended getting compression socks because I'm on my feet all day. I have yet to find socks that fit as well as these, go on as easily, and support as long. Will be buying additional pairs in the near future.",1
1,"Trying these leggings on was not a pleasant experience. I wear a size 2 petite so I am not a heavy set woman but I do have curves. All major brand capri leggings in a size small fit me fine (rebock, nike, under armour) but these were easily 2 inches longer than they should have been while on me. I took them off and measured the inseam at 23.5. That extra inch and a half in a streatch fabric equates to a lot of extra length on the body. I really dont even think these would be capri length unless you were 5'10"". The fabric doesnt breath either. Like. At. All. In my bedroom with the fan on in the dead of winter, I was already overheating and I typically run cold (I sleep with a heated blanket and wool socks, I mean come on!). It also came with either a stain or a mark in the fabric on the thigh already. This product was a joke.",0
4,They work. I purchased these to put in my ball bag while umpiring as we can wear watches or have phones on the field. With the material it may stand up to some light shots from foul balls behind the plate.,1
1,Stitching is already coming apart after just one week of use. Don‚Äôt recommend.,0
1,Not a good fit and not comfortable.<br />Took way to long to get.,0
4,Love this handbag EXCEPT the strap is so distracting.  It is very cheap looking plastic. Sure wish the vendors would give full disclousure when describing there items.  Decided to keep it and I will add a black leather strap.,1
5,"I purchased these 925 Sterling Silver Swarovski Crystal Flower Vine Design Cuff Earrings for my daughter as a gift. I must point out the positive aspects of these earrings. I love how absolutely beautiful the Swarovski Crystal Flower Vince earrings are, as well as how absolutely stunning they look in your ears. My daughter has not yet got them as they are a gift for her, however, I inspected the quality of the earrings, which they are not cheaply made and are high-quality material. The Swarovski Crystals shine and glimmer so beautifully and make this pair of earring stand out. I personally tried these earrings on to see how they would look in my daughter's ear and the way they are made are super cute. Actually, I have been contemplating on purchasing a pair of these earrings for myself. I definitely plan on purchasing and doing much more business with this seller and become a continued buyer from this seller. I must say that I absolutely love that I was able to purchase these earrings at such a discounted price.",1
3,"Good price, but look very cheap, very thin and wick!",0
5,Great tech - very satisfied with support and thickness of material,1
2,"Good watch, easy to set and read but band is very cheap and way too short.",0
5,Love them all.,1
5,"I got back online to see if I could find more dresses from this brand! So soft! And cute!! I ordered a 2xl because I read other reviews, I normally wear an xl. I think the xl would have been fine as well but this 2xl fits like a dream! So comfy!! And stretchy!! I love where the waist falls!! I‚Äôm so excited to wear this dress!",1
5,"Me encanto color tal como se muestra en la imagen, la tela es fresca y se ve de buena calidad la talla es la adecuada pero viene amplia y larga mido 1.65 m y peso 73 kilos.",1
1,Completely see through.,0
2,Order a size up from your normal. They run small. This is weird because i have the same ones in medium and they fit fine.,0
4,"A bit more snug than I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11, 190ish pounds and I had to get the XXL for it to fit the way I want, which was a bit looser like a true jogger. If you want a snug/yoga pant type fit, I‚Äôd recommend getting your normal size. If you want them to be loose, size up! Material is super soft, feels like yoga pants, not swishy at all. I got the drawstring version of the dark camo and the pictures are spot on. Length is just above the ankle, so not too short but may not be want some folks are looking for.<br /><br />Overall, I will probably get more pairs in the future, now that I know the right size. Let‚Äôs up they are consistent. üò¨",1
1,Waste of money,0
3,Order a size up. These fit small and are very short. Quality is good and design is cute.,0
2,"Im not crazy about them, at all. They are a nasty yellow and the glue shows, so it looks tacky.",0
5,I am ordering more.  LOVE THEM!,1
1,Breaks easily.,0
5,"My son loved this sweatshirt. This was a replacement for the one he lived in. Sadly he is too big for yourh sizes, we returned it.",1
3,They were not comfortable for my granddaughter<br />they hurt her feet‚Äôs,0

5,Fits perfect and made well. worth every penny,1
3,"I bought this set because I really liked the burgundy scarf. I didn‚Äôt actually like the other one but I was more expensive to buy it by itself. When I received them I was disappointed because the colors look very different from the picture. The burgundy looking one looks just like rust and the multi-colored one doesn‚Äôt have orange it‚Äôs that same weird rust color. I kept them just because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle of returning them. Also it‚Äôs a really nice warm, large, infinity scarf which is what I like. I just wish it was burgundy like it is displayed.",0
5,My eye did not get hurt.,1
1,Order 2 sizes too large and it was still way too small. It was also a lot shorter than advertised. It was also cut differently than the photo showed. The skirt was more of a straight cut than flair out.,0
1,This wand was poorly made and fell apart on the 1st day my daughter had it,0
5,Awesome!!look exactly like shown and are gorgeous.appear far from expensive than they are. Came on time and are definitely worth recommending.,1
5,"Very nice necklace, great quality, unbelievable price!",1
3,"The lenses are a little smaller that I had wanted, but they will do as a spare.",0
5,"Very nice bag. Has a zipper and adjustable strap. Sturdy bag that can hold iPads, wallets, phone.",1
4,"Pretty simple pajama pant. 100% cotton so it's comfortable, blue-color is cute for my daughter. Size was true. It runs a little long (she's 5'2), so someone taller would be okay. Price seems high on amazon though ($18).",1
4,"This cardigan is lightweight and soft. It‚Äôs great for cool fall mornings and nights. It looks nice but the button holes are not stitched and if you are not careful when you button or unbutton the sweater, there are threads that will come loose.",1
5,Got them for my husband. He loves them. I want to try a pair for myself! Would buy them again,1
3,Too short,0
1,"I read all the rave reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. And since it had such great reviews, I decided to buy 2 so I could alternate. When I opened the packages, I saw there were some odd stains on one of the wraps. The other one was not stained, so I'm not sure if I was sent a used one. I tried several times to put on the wrap, but each time, it immediately rolled up on itself and dug into my back. I am going to have to send them back. Super disappointed in this product.",0
2,"Way big says one size fits but the sleeves are too long,  i'm 5'2 and it goes before my knees.  Wraps around me almost twice and in average build.",0
1,"These have no lining and the material is see thru. They would be great if you could wear them out of the house without getting arrested for indecent exposure. I will be returning them, ugh.",0
1,"I wish I could return these. They are ridiculously hard to close around an Olympic weight bar. Don‚Äôt buy them, look for an alternative and save your money",0
3,"I buy PJs too large on purpose, for comfort.  I take them in as needed.  And then I cut off  some length and hem them shorter.  .<br /><br />These have frustrated me.  The fabric is very difficult to work with.  It slips and slides.  Even with a new and very fine needle in the machine, the thread bunches up, so the pajamas do not look good.  I have worn myself out trying to fix them and will just have to make the most of a bad job, even though I hate giving up!.<br />.",0
1,"While these fit fine, the seams split on two pairs after one washing. They are poor quality.",0
5,"I ordered these for my son , as we are not quick at tying our shoes yet. We have not had any issue with this pair, and they are still in his shoes a month later. I love that he can slip his shoes on and off, and run in them, and they are not too loose.",1
3,"I know there is variation between screen display color, but the green just isn‚Äôt even close to the color as it appeared my screens. There‚Äôs some stretch to the fabric, so it did a reasonable job of accommodating my small waist and bigger bust & hips. The lace is nice. I‚Äôm just bummed about the color.",0
1,Too big for my face,0
5,"LOVE the top of this suit. Super fashion forward and good quality. Comes with ties so you have extra support if needed. The bottoms however were a bit skimpy for my taste. I wish you could order top and bottom separately because if I exchange for the bigger size, the top would be too small :( The bottoms do have ties on the side so they are adjustable, just not enough fabric for my liking. I will be keeping it and wearing on my vacation in Mexico but probably not after that.",1
5,No shedding inside onto my clothes! That was my biggest issue with puffy coates.,1
4,Mother's day gift,1
2,I work at UPS so depending what u want these for they only last a week,0
4,"It is very beautiful bag, but it is not a large as I aspected...",1
3,They are ok...the material on the bands are not very wide so the pattern on them doesn‚Äôt show enough for me.  I might return these.<br /><br />They fit nicely and the patterns are nice but they barely show once placed on the head.,0
1,"Alright - I ordered a 1X thinking it would fit but it only fits my size M 18 year old! Also, it showed up with one of the arms un-stitched. This is a total POS, RUN!",0
5,Very pretty. I love this top. Wish there were more colors,1
1,Double flared ones wouldn‚Äôt go in. Wrong sizing. Found out today when I tried putting some in. First time putting them in since I purchased them.,0
3,"I love the pants but I was about to send them back since I was looking for a fit like that for golf.  There are no pockets, gotta have pockets when you play golf, keeping the pants anyway. Are there some golf pants that fit my description?",0
3,"Great dress for a picnic or something to put on for a day in the park.  Thank God, I bought it a size to big because it was poorly made.",0
5,Perfect,1
3,"This Ekouaer Women's Sweatsuits Set is good to wear lounging around indoors on a chilly day. The fabric is soft and comfortable. As described, this two-piece outfit has side pockets and elastic on the bottom of the pants. What I don't particularly like is the color of the outfit I chose which is not flattering on me and the grey band that emphasizes the chest area.",0
5,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4-148lbs and i purchase a size small.<br />It fit fine, once i got help zipping it up. Good quality! I love it!",1
1,"Very cheap material and finish on the piping is poor. Waste of my money, I can use it to add to my pjs at night",0
4,Missing size stamp or logo inside shirt .,1
5,I love the bowed fabric so I don't suck the mask as I speak.  It fits more snugly than other masks for a feeling of extra protection.,1
1,Did not have the fuller cut women sizes usually have,0
5,these socks are great.  They are comfortable and look good on.  I would buy them again.,1
5,"These are great, real jean, thick, made well. They DO NOT run small, I‚Äôm not sure why so many people have said they do, maybe they changed them after the reviews? But they run true to size or a little bigger than true.",1
5,These sunglasses are super cute! Good quality! Great for the summer,1
5,They are working great so far.,1
5,Very good product just got the wrong size,1
5,Nice,1
5,They‚Äôre so cute & comfortable!!! Ordering moreüòé,1
5,Great suit for fun summer beach wear.,1
4,Good set for the price. They are sturdy enough for the price. I wear ties daily in the business world and these work well! I will order them again when I start to lose the clips...I have already lost one üòï,1
5,"Great Christmas gift! Every time I talk with her, she raves about how beautiful this brilliant bracelet is.",1
3,Great case but hard to charge phone w/ case on,0
5,Very beautiful purse! Worth the money.,1
3,Very nice just a little big.,0
1,"WHAT IS GOING ON!?! THIS DRESS MADE ME FEEL SO UGLY. I WILL NEVER WEAR IT BECAUSE IT FITS HORRIBLY AND I HAVE A GOOD FIGURE. HONESTLY, I NEEDED THIS DRESS FOR A WEDDING AND IT IS NOW IN THE TRASH!!! I WOULD NEVER WEAR IT ANYWHERE. WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY!!!",0
4,Same as above.  Too big for my wrists and no way to adjust.,1
3,Not happy to fight on the arms,0
1,"Ordered size 3X it was so small my 16 year old wears a small could not even get it on, and now I cant send back because they wont take it back.  Made really cheap on label worst buy ever.",0
5,Super cute! I wore this to the maroon 5 concert in NYC! I am 5‚Äô11 and it was a great cropped fit!,1
5,Great item,1
1,didn't like them,0
2,I ordered a medium for my daughter and a 2xl for myself. They were the exact same size! The size on the pants say the correct size but they are the same size across when you hold them up together. She can perfectly wear both pair! The sizing on the larger sizes runs very same while the smaller sizes seem to run true to size.,0
5,Seems to be great quality. I had a Liz Clairborne one similar to this one but the buckle broke. I am hoping this buckle is stronger. I am please with it so far but it has only been a week.,1
4,Don't like the trim but wearable. Will make it work,1
5,Love the stress and that the sweater can come off. Runs pretty big but she'll grow so that's ok. Fabric is pretty soft,1
1,"Awful, hideous, horrendous, laughable",0
2,This hurt my ear. Couldn't sleep in it,0
5,I love this weekend bag. I had enough room for 4 pair of clothes and personal items. The shoe pocket wasn't big enough for sneakers but for a pair of slides or flip flops. I just used it for something else.,1
5,Fits good. good quality. I have bought this hat twice now. The color fades but no more than any other hat that I have worn,1
3,"so many loose rope not sure how to use them all,  I do like the color and top bottom was totally not to size chart",0
3,"When I tried this sweater on, both my boyfriend and my friend said it looked like a grandma sweater. I think its a good, cozy sweater, but it is just not very attractive. It fits me right, but it is a little long to be considered cropped. Super soft though!",0
5,"This dress is stunning. The quality is beautiful and so expensive looking.  Unfortunately, I had to return it because the small was too big on me :( very disappointing.",1
1,I ordered a large; it must have been for a child,0
1,Start to rust in just three weeks. The back of the watch started to get rust stains and leaving marks on by wrist. It says stainless steel - but I doubt they used good quality stainless steel.<br />Stay away!,0
4,The bracelets are too large,1
5,THEY TURN COLORS......SAD!,1
3,"My God they are only Plastic inserts, how bad can you screw it up?",0
2,"Terrible material, would bot recommend",0
2,"Meh. Dress is okay, you should probably order a size up, it is body con for sure. If you order the light pink it is see through. I put it on and you could see my nipples (i am super fair skinned, my nipples are not dark).",0
5,My 12 year old wore this as part of his disco costume for halloween. He already had the fro and needed a costume to match. This shirt was perfect and fit correctly.,1
1,poor quality.,0
1,"i did not like it ,very loor quality and doesnt worth to pay that amount it is cheap product ,$1",0
5,Was exactly what I needed :),1
5,Eventually I will buy every pair! I love this style of pants and people love them on me!,1
1,I ordered this product in a larger size then I wear just in case.  Way too small.  Not worth it to return.  Very unhappy.,0
5,"I bought the red one.  I love the embroidery done with the eagle.  I coach flag football.  We were the Eagles last season when we won the championship.  I'm a patriot at heart (and a Patriots fan).  We will probably be the Eagles this season again so I figured this cap will serve two purposes - show my national pride and the team's identity.  I would have liked it to fit a little ""lower"" around the head than it does - like a quarter inch or so all the way around but it does fit well, looks great.  You know you've bought something cool when your wife can't stand to go out with you wearing it. :-)  Would buy again.",1
5,"The leather quality is fantastic, soft and seems durable. The extra slots for cards and cash are convenient. This can probably temporarily replace my wallet while I'm traveling since it can hold a few cards and a few bills when I'm out and about.",1
5,"I just bought 2 pairs of the 90 degree yoga pants. They are great!  I'm 5'4&#34; and currently 160 lb.  I am 2 months postpartum and wanted a few pairs of yoga pants to get me through the transition period while losing my baby weight.  The large fits me perfectly, though maybe just a bit long. I got the deep teal space dye and the emerald green. The teal is a silkier, slightly thinner material while the green is more cottony and thicker feeling. They are both nice and thick, just one more than the other.  They will be really nice for fall and winter running. I am very pleased with them, especially for the great price. I think they will fit even after I lose my 15 lb of baby weight. I will definitely be buying a few more pairs!",1
2,The size was not true. I should have asked for the next size up.,0
4,Shorter than it says.  But beautiful quality.  Very happy,1
5,Fits perfectly and the description is very accurate! Love the colors and the shipping was fast! Will definitely be buying more colors.,1
1,"Well a few things were not right with this item. First the top of the shoulders only had one elastic,  second the bottom did have any design or swoop, thirdly no belt, and lastly too big. I ordered a small and it fit like a toga costume. This was nothing like the picture. Sad because I was hoping to wear this weekend. A definitely RETURN.",0
5,Love it,1
5,my girl friend loves it,1
3,Looks way different on,0
2,Softness I liked,0
1,Difficult to change the lenses.,0
1,Belt stretches all the time need to keep adjusting would not buy junk I'm returning for refund,0
2,very pretty and soft but NOT FOR LARGE PEOPLE!!,0
4,"I had a similar set and forgot it was in the window.  I rolled down the window to thank a driver for letting me merge into traffic and one antler blew away.  I had to buy these to replace it. This set seems pretty identical and the first set did have a seem tear that I sewed together, so they aren't going to last forever in the elements but should hang on for a few seasons since it is only a month or so of exposure.  The bells will rust and the ribbons might fly off but it is fun and festive to have on your car for the holidays.  I got this set on sale so the value was great but not sure I would purchase at full price since the wind and weather wear the material down.",1
5,"Loved this for what it is...a simple cheap underbust corset... Not a high-end one but a corset on a budget that is nicely put together. The boning is not steel and probably is a sturdy large zip tie, the ties remind me of boot lacing but cinched nice and tight. The pattern quality is awesome and the color is deep and rich plus the stitching is clean. I loved it and I got so many compliments which  made it even better! I got a 5x and wear an 18, perfect and no gap in back. Hubby even made a comment after he cinched me in that I lose any more weight this will not get any tighter.",1
5,"Review for the Black version, Works great and does what you'd expect it to do, had a slight smell out of the pack but disappeared once it was in the open air. I have a standard adult sized head, so take that as you will for fitting purposes.",1
2,"Nice looking gloves, they just don't keep my hands much warmer than the $1 gloves from target. How is that possible?<br />Update: after a few months, all the tech padding on the fingertips fell off, so now I can't use my phone. Just don't buy these. Better than nothing though.",0
2,There was supposed to be 5 masks and I only got 4,0
3,It broke the second I tried to put it on my son.,0
5,I used it for the first time on my locs last night. It stayed in all night. This is the first one I‚Äôve purchased that stayed on. I love it.,1
5,"Love the waist beads, the string is solid and holds well. The colors are really cute too",1
5,"These are terrific.  Great fit, comfy",1
2,"The necklace is lovely, but for smaller necks.",0
4,Gave it to my teacher for Christmas/ end of semester and she loved it,1
5,Its a Very Good Shoe!<br />It just gets a bit hot during hot Summer days!<br />But it fits great and VERY COMFORTABLE.<br />I Got a lot of compliments at work!<br /> I love them!,1
3,"I am short and not thick and these things were way too short! I bought two of these, one for me and a friend for a costume and we both had to cut the feet so we could wear it. Otherwise they were comfortable and fun to wear, but of course we could only wear them once.",0
5,Great product for the $,1
5,It's what I was looking for,1
5,Love it Good quality true size<br />Soft material,1
3,Not for women with large chest.,0
1,It broke after 1 day,0

5,It was given as a gift. My daughter loves them.,1
5,Perfect gift!,1

5,Awesome,1
4,The socks did not work for me. They keep slipping off the heels. Seller was willing to refund.,1
5,Mask,1
2,"The arms are a good length, but the torso is shorter than it looks in the pictures and the material is so thin you can see through it.",0
1,Not the same as pictured.  What a rip off!!!!!,0
1,"This &#34;watch&#34; (it doesn't deserve that title) gains time so fast you can't rely on it for even an hour following setting it.  It looks good but it's totally useless.  And don't think you can return it for a refund, since your cost to ship it back to China will exceed your purchase price.  A raw deal and Amazon should not carry it any longer.  Buyer beware.",0
3,Don't believe it's real leather.  Handles broke within 2 months.,0
5,So comfy and warm. I absolutely love to wear them.,1
1,"First of all, I love the earrings because they are different, but the wire that holds the earrings keep falling off! I‚Äôm afraid to wear them outside because I might loose the earring off of the wire!",0
5,"I have been looking for brown pull-on jeans and found them!  They are very very comfortable and I love them!  I needed to shorten them as I did not buy petite.  (Wasn't sure they would be long enough, but  Next time I will!",1
2,The top part isn‚Äôt stretchy and it‚Äôs uncomfortable.,0
5,"This Turtleneck appears to be well made, looks good, and will keep me warm.  It fits me really well and I hope it lasts a long time.",1
1,I gave this as a birthday gift and it arrived not working.  how very disappointing.,0
5,"This is the second order I make of this socks. I love them! My little one has sweaty feet so these are perfect, they are super thin and they stay on.",1
5,"This is surprisingly a one piece suit, which to me saves me so much time in getting ready. It's beautiful and elegant. Very professional looking. I purchased the biggest size and it fits perfect for a 1x.",1
3,It‚Äôs good material but much longer than I expected for someone short. More like a dress. I‚Äôm sure it fits well on someone 5‚Äô5 or taller.,0
5,Fantastic tee-shirt! Love it!,1
1,The hoops were not included with the studs as advertised when purchased. Big letdown since that was the main reason for buying.,0
5,I'm 5'0 a true big booty Judy and these fit perfectly! They arrived in three days. I will definitely buy again.,1
5,Found them for my husband.  He uses them for work.,1
5,"These leggings are great for my Saturday morning volleyball game and errands around town.  I am between a Large and XL and decided to order an XL and glad I did order up.  I'm only 5'6"" and these leggings were a bit long for my liking but nothing that I could fix with a simple roll at the bottom.  The side pockets for my phone is a must!  Overall good leggings for the price!",1
5,"It is still feeling like summer in Arkansas so I haven't had the chance to bring these out in full force yet, but they will be one of my most worn pairs this season for sure. They're so comfortable and true to size. I wear a 9, sometimes order a 10 for good measure, but these 9's fit perfectly. I love the height of the little heel and how far they go up and the suede is nice. My favorite part is the toe; it's not too pointy or square. They look and feel great. The ring on the back of the black looked a little silver in the picture, but it looks a little more gold to me. I love these though and want to get in more colors. 10/10 recommend!",1
1,"It shocks me that places like this are able to stay in business.  Further proof that all it takes to run a business in the U.S. is a pulse and a bad idea.<br /><br />We ordered wedding bands via their website on October 17th.  We didn't receive any sort of email confirmation, so being the proactive folks that we are, we sent an email the very next day asking if they had, in fact, received our order.  This is the response that we got:  ""yes i did see the order come through.  chris""  The lack of professional communication skills (and capitalization) did cause a fair amount of eye-rolling and some discussion about cancelling the order, but we decided (stupidly) to just roll with it.<br /><br />We selected the next day shipping option for an additional fee, and by our calculation, the rings should have been in our hands by Saturday Oct. 30th.  Well Saturday came and went with no rings.  On Sunday my husband sent an email inquiring about the status of our order and ""Chris"" assured us that he would check on it when he went into the office on Monday.  Monday came and went with no email from Chris.<br /><br />Finally, on Thursday morning, with no rings and no communication in sight, our patience was worn out, so my husband sent an email to both ""Chris"" as well as their ""customer support"" asking them to just cancel the order.  Customer support responded and informed us that THEY HAD NO SUCH ORDER.  That's right.  Our initial follow up email the day after we ordered, and two email exchanges after that, and ""Chris"" didn't even bother to actually CHECK and make sure they had actually gotten our order.  It probably goes without saying that this ""Chris"" character didn't even bother to respond to our cancellation request.<br /><br />So basically, for almost three weeks we stupidly sat around waiting for rings that were never actually ordered because of some glitch with their system. We did our part by trying to confirm with them that they had received it, but they totally dropped the ball on their end and failed to check, and then failed to communicate and THEN failed to apologize.  So, let's walk through this- fail, fail, fail.  That's a whole lot of failing folks.<br /><br />Come on.  Honestly.  Are we really at the point in the US where we have a bunch of drunk and retarded 3rd graders running businesses?  You know what?  Never mind.  Don't answer that....",0
2,"I bought these size 10/11 laces for my son's size 10 new balance sneakers. They were a tad too small, and too tight, they wouldn't stretch enough for him to get them on easily. So, I skipped a hole in the middle while lacing and now they fit ok. However, after only wearing them for exactly one week, one of the red metal tabs on the end has fallen off. I have tied a knot with it instead so my son can still wear his shoes for now. Not sure if I'll try these again, or just put the laces back in. I'm bummed, because we liked the color and they seemed to be ok, until yesterday.",0
5,Nice scarf. Fit was good. Got some compliments on it.,1
1,It's tiny. Way to small.,0
3,it is very pretty.  It is super super long.  I have to either find somebody to hem it or wear it all the way up to my chest to keep from tripping on it.  Not meant for short people.  I am 5'3&#34; tall.,0
4,runs abit small . but i really like the totally me,1
5,"This is a small earring with a very sparkly statement on the ear and in the hand. I really love the color of the crystal, which does remind me of champagne or sparkling cider. I really enjoy wearing it. It really perks up the ear and adds glow. I bought it to go with casual flowery cotton dresses and blouses. I‚Äôve worn it all day 3 times since receiving it just a couple of weeks ago without any reaction to my ear. It‚Äôs light and comfortable, and it hangs well. I love that it doesn‚Äôt tug the ear lobe. I can‚Äôt stand heavy earrings, and personally, I prefer small earrings. Nice designs from this maker.  I‚Äôve bought several different kinds of earrings from this maker, because they are very charming and you can tell whoever made them put a lot of care and thought into it. Box is nice too for gift giving. Very prompt delivery by Amazon.",1
2,"The first time I washed it - in a lingerie bag, in cold water, on delicate, then hang dried - the mesh started coming apart and fraying.",0
5,Nice smooth material.  Fits well.  Dressy.  Thinking of ordering other colors.,1
5,"Such a cute dress! Perfect for work, and it has pockets! Great material and price. Will buy more!",1
1,No the buckle broke already . Not a very good product,0
2,I would recommend ordering a size up if you want a loose/comfy fit. Material soft but heavier weight. Definitely winter loungers.,0
5,"I use these bags for grocery shopping and I love them! I've already gotten so many compliments from friends and family about how cute they are. I think they're pretty easy to fold back up and stick in the pouch because you just fold them wherever the crease lines are. They're not the easiest to get on and off the carabiner and I also wouldn't recommend using it to carry more than 2 bags, but it's really nice to be able to clip them all together. It's easy to carry them in on the carabiner and throw them in your cart while you do your shopping.",1
5,Fit 2 and 3 year old great!,1
2,They are too small and too short and too thin. Not a good hiking sock,0
5,Fits well for a 36C cup person. I generally wear smalls in tops and medium if the maker is China.,1
5,"Love my lazy girl belt. Takes a bit longer to initially put on, but easy in/off for the remainder of the day.",1
4,Sleeves did not lay to the full length of my arm/wrist.,1
5,"Love this amazing design , and comfort/modern man style",1
1,"Cheap material, wrinkles after wash, feels low quality",0
2,"I stepped out of the room to grab tea. When I came back, two of these were useless due to my little ball of chaos. I'd hate to see what my beast could achieve. Yeah, it was my fault for leaving out so I didn't request a return or file a formal complaint. Maybe I should have because the strong wasn't long enough but whatever.",0
5,Color and quality are so good I ordered a second one for me.  So we bought 2 and mine has the closing tab.  Love them both.,1
5,Good and durable,1
5,I really love this dress. Very comfortable and washes well.,1
3,Looked great for the occasion. Wish it had a better tie. Cheap ribbon. An elastic would have been better.,0
5,Super cute. Good quality,1
5,"Light, not too heavy. Nice case, good buy.",1
5,Great quality and so cute!,1
4,"Beautiful product, arrived before delivery date.",1
1,"Nice hat but it is not foldable or packable as in the description. It was shipped in a box with other items which bent the brim out of shape. If it was foldable, the brim should have gone back into shape after being on a stand for a couple of days but it didn't.",0
5,Good quality,1
1,Wouldn't buy again only a few are even half suitable,0
5,Beautiful necklace. My Daughter loves it.,1
2,Cute dress however poorly made. My pockets are uneven one is longer than the other.,0
3,I like the set and color. Very cute however you should probably order a size up if you are 1x-3x . The threads are not strong and will come apart through the day. I have a xxl and it fit like a xl with minimal stretch.,0
1,"These watches are complete garbage.  I bought one, had to have it replaced when moisture got into it the first time I took it in the pool (keep in mind they are waterproof), the replacement I was provided with lasted all of 6 months before the second hand literally just fell off one random day.  I fought with customer service to get that one replaced and that replacement lasted a little over a year and before, wait for it, the whole thing stopped working after going in the ocean for 20 minutes.  Don't buy these Hong Kong made pieces of junk.",0
2,"For one, it was supposed to have a hood and it did not. Second, it is almost too small and I bought a large, when I normally wear a medium. Tight across the shoulders. If I would have known this, I would have bought an extra large.",0
5,Very nice graduation gift.,1
5,"PERFECT!  Gorgeous, stylish, great quality,desirable and soooo many compliments!",1
1,The Shirt looks stupid,0
1,Incredibly cute and dainty. Would have been the perfect ring if the 'diamond' didn't fall out the second day I owned/wore it.,0
2,Made for a 6' woman.  I'm 5'2 115 lbs and swimming in the size small that fits more like an XL.  Wayyyy to long and the sleeves are awkwardly big,0
3,It is much smaller than we thought it would be.,0
5,"First of all, i'd like to say this necklace is beast.<br /><br />I love the adjustable strap and the pendent is very attractive.The design just fits the biohazard symbol.<br />I love it :D",1

3,This mask is well made but the top of it kept sliding off my daughter's nose.,0
5,I love this. It‚Äôs so warm and comfortable,1
5,Great purchase ! Well worth the money. Quality of this hat is a ten out of ten. üòÑ,1
1,Product was not very good quality. Disappointed in purchase.,0
5,"Super cute, I'm exchanging mine for a different color.  I feel it was too light and I looked washed out.",1
3,Lasted for like three months. The lace then began to unravel and develop holes. Cute for a while but not a long while,0
1,"They don't fit, and it's too expensive to send them back.",0
5,this worked perfect!  My daughter and her friends had a dress like your favorite character from Heathers day at school (they are doing the musical).  She is wearing this jacket (on the far right).  (P.S. Gotta love theatre kids!),1
5,"Very small, but very cute! My girlfriend loves it. She loves the necklace so much she is afraid to wear itüòÇ",1
1,these are pretty but they do not fit well..... I got a xxlg and could not get it over my chest to even wear as a bra,0
5,The back heel pads rub off after a couple times of feet insertions. The rest work perfectly fine.,1
4,Too tight. Nice fabric.,1
5,"My granddaughter loves pink, princesses, and fun. This is all three. She plays dress up and loves to pretend.",1
5,Quality is better than you expect for the price.,1
3,"Fabric is not the softest tencel, a bit scratchy on the inside.<br />Pants are so long.<br />I usually wear medium but because it was recommended to size up, I bought a large. The legs are too roomy but the elastic waist was too tight. Will have to return.",0
1,The clasp broke literally the first time I used it. I never even got to put it on my ankle.,0
3,Not all the same size and while washing even in delicate bag the seams pull out and make unusable. But designs are fun w/ great colors. Too bad only a few actually fit and the seams around the elastic ripped out.,0
1,"Opened it up and was let down. The fabric is NOT good, very see through even though it says royal blue. I know its a cheap dress but still the fabric could pass for swim suit fabric.",0
5,I‚Äôm sure my son is going to love it for a Christmas gift.,1
2,Thicker than wanted,0
1,while the band looks great using it is not very functional. it‚Äôs difficult to get the metal nub into the hole to fasten band onto wrist.,0
5,Great fit and light weight,1
5,"Great earrings for the price! Beautiful shine and shimmer!<br />I do agree with some of the other reviews that the stud length may be a little long but I guess it depends on the thickness of your ear. I am using them for my cartilage piercings and they are too long.<br />Regardless, these earrings are nice 20 gauge studs.<br />All 4 sizes shown in picture",1
1,Cheap looking cheap quality nothing like on site,0
2,"Quality isn‚Äôt the best, zipper doesn‚Äôt work well.",0
4,"I've used a couple of the sizes here, does the job well, however the bigger the taper is, the longer it gets, which gets pretty uncomfortable. But loved the colors!",1
1,I would give a zero star if I could. Wore the first pair once and ended up with a huge hole. Returned the entire package.,0
5,So very beautiful and super classy! Not flashy just perfect!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
5,Just a tiny bit too large in the fingertips and upper palm... no padding though.  Returned and bought gel palms instead. Well constructed and good looking.,1
1,Runs very small order a size up 3x and did it get passed my thighs,0
3,"I love the idea of these. I like the material but they run small. The compression is amazing. They lack pockets which sucks imo. But I returned mine because they rolled down as soon as I put them on. I've had two kids, I have a pouch but I'm mostly blocky so I was surprised that they rolled so easily. I will probably repurchase after I slim down.",0
4,"Very nice, well made skirt.  The material is substantial.  However, it is not a true red.  It is orange.",1
3,I like the feel of the material. It looks good w/ jeans or slacks.,0
3,Not wide enough,0
4,"My only complaint is that they don‚Äôt stay in place when working out. When doing HIIT or running, they fall down and gave me a diaper butt lol. They are squat proof, super soft, no camel toes, etc. just didn‚Äôt stay up. I‚Äôm a size 4-6 in jeans, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 155lbs And I ordered a medium",1
4,The fit was nice just a bit short but it is nice and soft.,1
2,Was yellow,0
2,"Like the dress - the material and color, but it is noticeably poorly made. It will be returned.",0
5,Cute product and fit my five year old.,1
3,Smaller than I thought it would be<br />But seemed well made.<br />It was a gift and they liked it and thought it would be very useful,0
1,I got it not even a week later it tarnished very disappointed never buying again don‚Äôt waste ur more,0
5,"I got this as a gift for someone else and it was too snug on him. So depending on your size, you may have to order a size or two sizes up. I wear a medium in rash guards, 170lbs and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù.<br />My friend usually wears a large, he fights at 170lbs and is 6‚Äô3‚Äù. Lol<br />But it‚Äôs great and the image is so beautifully printed and I was very happy to see it. And the seller was very kind and responded quickly to changes I had to make to my order.",1
1,too big,0
5,love these beads will order again.,1
5,Follow the sizing chart and you'll get exactly what you pick. This shirt is very comfy and flowy!,1
3,"I bought this as a gift for my sister, and she said they are very cute and look of good quality but that they seemed to run a little bigger than the size you ordered.",0
2,"Cute necklace, but it arrived not completely assembled. There was some wire clearly sticking out which scratched me as I put it in. But alas, yo get what you pay for I guess!",0
1,Blouse ran small,0
1,Very cheaply  made.,0
5,"As expected, priced right!",1
5, ,1
1,Very Bad quality,0
5,When you purchase DIFF part of proceeds go to dedignated charities! I like that! The eyeware is beautiful!!!‚Äô,1
5,Love the color and the fact that it's so compact!,1
5,"Love this brand of workout socks.  They are so comfortable, colorful and affordable.  This particular pair is a bit thicker than their usual.  That's not a problem per se, just unexpected and I'm temperature sensitive, so with the warming weather, they made me a bit hotter than I usually get doing my barre workout, but that's okay.  It is a workout after all!  They'll be even better in winter and great for those who go to studios which are ice cold.",1
5,Todo como esperaba,1
5,"These are nice glasses, I like the style and they are comfortable. It's hard to get a sports strap over the ends though they seem to stay put",1
2,Showed it was longer on the model so was disappointment that its only just past the knees. I should have known with the other picture. Not going to hassle with  shipping it back. I will use it.,0
3,These were a little smaller fit then the same 36-38 regular boxer shorts I wear,0
5,I have ordered several pairs of Rocket Dog shoes. I normally wear an 8 1/2 but with these shoes I am more comfortable with an 8.,1
3,"I love the color, fit, stretch. It's just not a robe like sweater dress like I expected. More of a long sleeve hooded dress. You expect robes and sweaters to be snuggly and warm. This is lightweight and convenient.",0
1,clasps locked shut. poor quality.,0
5,"Back a LONG time ago when I first got into the trades, I worked with a guy who had been in the army.  It was my first winter working full time outdoors and I was wearing only my work boots with double wool socks but they were far from doing the job.  Anway, I was talking about my feet and this guy tells me about MM boots- at first I thought he was joking  but he assured me that he was not and so I took a trip to my local army/navy surplus.  I bought a pair of used boots for $10 or something and the only reason I replaced them was because my feet grew.<br />Here's how I used them:  I would wear my regular boots to work(bringing an x-tra pair of socks to change into) and once I got into the shanty I would put my MM boots on that had been sitting close(but not too close) to our stove, on their side so the heat could get into the boot and make sure they were dried from the day before.  When I was actually working and moving, the boots were light enough so as not to be an obstacle.  Often, I would have to flag for concrete trucks which is a lot of not working even though it does entail some walking.  Even if I had been working all morning and my feet were already sweaty, and then at noon got sent to flag- didn't matter.  Feet still warm.<br />Worked part time for UPS at the airport- no days off for the cold and once again these boots were fantastic.<br />Eventually I became a carpenter and then an iron worker and as an iron worker, the heel on MM boots don't go so well with the work although I have seen one guy use them in the winter anyway.<br />I learned a lot about keeping feet warm from these boots:  Like air is a great insulator and that cold really mostly seeps up from the ground so it doesn't matter as much how much insulation you have OVER your feet if it's not under your feet as well.<br />That is the end of my 'ode' to MM boots but will add this too:  Because I realized the importance of a good sole, I eventually learned that cork is a fantastic insulator too(which you will find on Haflinger woolen clogs).",1
4,Color isn‚Äôt as nice as pictured.,1
4,"I was a little confused on how to wear this when i got it. But its pretty neat. There are several ways you could wear it and you could add those larger pendants to this and it would look amazing. With just itself, it can be worn wrapped a few times or in a bow or just hanging. Its very toughly made. Its not real suede but it is very close look to it. You could wear this as a bracelet or a anklet, so many ideas. Did come in a little box so great gift for someone who you aren't sure what they wear and since its not metal, less likely for allergies.<br /><br />i received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.",1
1,This product is terrible,0
4,Nice looking wallet and appears to be well made. I gave it a 4 star rating because inserting credit cards into the pockets is very difficult.,1
1,"The shoes fit well , and material is comfortable. When connecting the cables to charge, they don‚Äôt always connect correctly. I had to connect and reconnect several times. A complete charge only lasts a few hours. The kids get upset. Then a recharge takes hours. They‚Äôre too impatient to wait. I thought being LED lights, they would last much longer.",0
5,Very nice cotton shirt. It's very good material and will wear well. Highly recommended.,1
5, ,1
1,Got XL and fits like a M,0
2,Bad material,0
3,They were great it‚Äôs just that they break easily mine broke the day I got it and hey weren‚Äôt really sturdy,0
3,"You get what you pay for. These are okay; however, they don't really stay on my glasses and they are shorter than they should be. Not my favorite products.",0
5,Good fit. Nice material,1
5,Amazing craftsmenship. I love these earrings. They are real and don't make my ears hurt. Plus no discoloration. I get compliments on them all the time. Thanks for my .40's.,1
2,"I ordered 3 pairs of 59 inch length laces. Each pair was a different length, and all were under 40 inches. While I've ordered products from China that were as advertised, these laces are not as advertised.",0
3,"I ordered these socks because I liked the style and especially liked the price point.  While the socks fit as expected and are comfortable, they are a thinner sock and I expect they will not wear as long as others I have purchased.",0
5,"Very comfortable, and easy to move in",1
5,I bought this gorgeous gloves for my son.  He love it.  So soft and touch sensitive works.,1
2,"Super cute!!!!! If only it actually fit.<br /><br />The large did not even come close! I have a fairly large &#34;dome&#34; (hat size 7 3/8&#34;) and this sun hat was barely 6&#34;. For anticipating a large and reading other decent reviews, I am now very disappointed.<br /><br />I also noticed the buttons of the smaller inner hat did not have enough to match up with the button holes of the larger brim attachment. I will be contacting the company to see if this was what caused the super teeny tiny sizing issue.",0
1,Don‚Äôt even waste your money order a 2XL and it‚Äôs fits like a small. Cheap material as well. Sizing off bad vendor,0
5,The color was beautiful and the length was great for heels or flats.,1
3,"The moment I took this out of the bag I knew it wasn't going to fit.  It was shaped like a ruler:  Straight through the waist, hips and thighs.  If you are truly curvy (coke bottle), don't buy or go up a size or two.  If you have a couple of curves (I am talking no more than a 3-4 inch difference between your waist and hips), go right on ahead.  I am a size 12, with a 9 inch difference between my waist and hips and this poor dress was begging for mercy.  I really wanted to like this, but it just isn't designed for women like me.",0
2,Pjs are attractive and lightweight for summer. I washed them before wearing and they shrunk almost a full size. I can‚Äôt imagine what they‚Äôll do after a second washing.<br />Still shrinking- I would Not recommend these pjs - can‚Äôt return after washing.,0
3,Little bit big but nice though.,0
5,Runs small so order a size up to avoid it being too snug in the mid section. Overall great tunic style dress that is more A line than billowing. The sleeves are a perfect length for taller women. Thicker jersey knit fabric is a nice weight and not see through.,1
5,My grandson lives his new robe!,1
5,I LOVE THIS COSPLAY. it's way better quality than I thought and is super flattering. I'm happy I'll get to wear it to more than one convention and I'll definitely buy another one. Zelda is one of my favorite games and this kimono is perfect,1
5,"Me encanto! La tela buena calidad y queda hermoso! Me queda de largo perfecto! Ya q soy peque√±a me queda en la mitad de la pierna ya q mido 5"" y no me gusta mas arriba de la rodilla. Lo recomiendo 100%",1
5,Comfy and get fit leggings!,1
4,"Love the look and clean lines, but a little boxier with shorter arm length than my other grace Karin pieces. Just not a good fit for my body",1
4,bill was slightly distorted but not too bad to notice,1
1,Not at all what I was expecting.,0
5,Loved the product!,1
3,Ok tank but not for an every day kind of tank so I returned.Was true to size and color though.,0
5,"These shirts are great!  I have very thin skin on my arms, and so they bruise easily.  I was looking for something to wear under a tshirt, etc.  I am short (5'1&#34;), with short arms, so I got these 3/4 length sleeves and they go clear to my wrists, which is exactly what I wanted.  Very light weight, with a silky feel.  I ordered several more, in other colors.",1
5,I bought this for my daughter to wear at her homecoming dance. It is her favorite dress yet. It has a stretchy material and the rhinestones are beautiful. She got a lot of compliments on this dress. We bought her the navy blue dress and it was gorgeous.,1
5,"todo bien, llego a tiempo y la ropita de muy buena calidad a muy buen precio, los recomiendo en un 100%.",1
2,"the top part is really loose, the string the holds it up is really long .",0
3,Disappointed with band. Extremely brittle for Ceramic. Be extremely careful when sizing as lugs in links break off easy. I will need to replace it with something more substantial.,0
5,This item was perfect for the graduation and matched the occasion exactly as I expected.,1
1,"It looked cheap, not good quality materials",0
3,"The problem is that they lights come in a big plastic bag, some are ALREADY ON when the package arrives consequently the battery life is low or the light no longer works.  Luckily I only needed 25 for my goody bags.  A word of CAUTION the little top did fall off of some so I wouldn't recommend the item for small children.  Would I buy again? Yes, the price is not bad.",0
2,"My husband sweetly bought this for me hoping I could do the 1 shoulder look. I can barely get my head through the neck hole much less try to even get it to my shoulder. The person who models this must've only been a foot wide from shoulder to shoulder! It also doesn't even come past my waist. The xl said it would fit me with room to spare and I did all my measurements before he bought it for me. The only thing I liked about it was the feel of the soft material.<br />My advice, order at least 3 sizes up from what you actually wear...unless you have boobs bigger than a B and a natural sized waist. Then all bets are off and you should look elsewhere for a sweater.",0
5,good product,1
5,"I usually buy Vibram toe shoes üëü, but they have a hefty price tag. So I opted for these to compare, because of the toe shaping. Really love them and they have a bit of a cushion so they are more supporting then the toe shoes.",1
2,Fabric was clingy,0
1,I only got one pack with 10 mask nothing else . I would never order this product again,0
1,"This product does not match the description. Instead of wool it is more like a cheap craft store felt, including childlike buttons. I don't think this is even worth $5. It is a complete waste of money",0
5,"This is just the right size to pack for a hospital stay, was able to pack all my toiletries, ID, tablet, extra ele. cords I just love this bag.",1
1,"The dress has a horrible smell, its see through , and the material is very cheap and shiny like a dress from that cheap store Rainbow",0
1,Quality is poor fit is worse,0
5,I am very happy with the product is very good quality.,1
5,Dainty watch. Beautiful with sparkles that dazzled. Bangle style with links and a clasp that is easy to buckle and unbuckled. It is a rectangle shaped watch with bezzled face. Wore it out to dinner and got many stares. I had to take it to a watch repair person to take out two links since i have a tiny wrist.  Even the watch repair person said such a pretty watch on my wrist and was surprised at how much it cost.  I will be careful to mot get it wet since it is such a pretty rose gold color. Watch arrives inside a black faux croc box with a display pillow. For the price and how quickly it arrives.  I have no regret eith purchase.,1
3,Has a horrible odor,0
5,Fits perfectly!,1
3,The shirt was nice but I ordered a medium and received a large. So I had to return it. But the quality seemed good.,0
1,This shirt is like a joke. I got the largest size and it was entirely too small. The material also does NOT feel like 95% cotton.,0
5,fit good and works as advertised.,1
1,Hilos jalados y ojal de cinta arrancado.,0
3,These pants look like old man golf pants in person. They sure are loose and floppy.,0
5,"I was a little concerned about sizing. There was conflicting information on size 12 us, but I ordered the European 47 and it fit perfectly. Very comfortable.",1
5,Got lots of compliments!,1
5,"Love this shirt , fix just right ! Very pleased!",1
5,"I've been really tired of having my glasses fall off because the lariat broke or the little rubber holder snapped, so I'm trying out these straps.<br />So far, so good and the company offers a lifetime warranty so who could go wrong? The pricing is more than fair for what I think is a quality product.",1
4,Seemed to be good quality. My son-in-law seemed to like it.,1
5,Love love love these shorts!!!,1
2,Shirt material feels good but the XL is not an XL. More like a Large. Returning it.,0
1,Not strong,0
5,Cap fits great . Covers his neck and top of back.Exactly what was needed.,1

3,Not the best beer opener but it works,0
5,Love this top got sooo many compliments at work!,1
3,It did leave my platinum chain like new but only downfall is for me idk about anybody else is that when i was finished cleaning it i put it on for a few minutes and the next day i got a bad rash on my back of my neck idk it was the components in the cloth or what what left my skin on my next very irradiated,0
3,"These are thin like the dress socks you‚Äôd wear when grandma‚Äôd pick out your clothes for you before Sunday service. They fit fine, but prepare to lace up your shoes again before heading out with these socks under them.",0
3,The fit and style of the shirt is good. It just seems like the iron on image was not carefully done and will likely come off. I will not put in the dryer. I am a new poodle owner and will keep the shirt.,0
3,"Very cute, fit nicely. Only 3 stars because it got a hole in the crotch in one wear. Thankfully I have sewing skills and was able to easily fix it.",0
3,"The left shoe while on the large size feels fine the right shoe feels like they over stuffed the instep. I also had chaffing from the elastic where the ends were cut maybe with a hot knife, after trimming this edge that is fine. I do like the ease of slipping them on and off, I also like the look of them.In all fairness, I have not contacted the company to complain about the fit of the right shoe I just have been wearing them a few hours every other day to break them in.",0
5,Comfortable,1
5,ran 22 miles in it and it was breeze. phone pocket is awesome I could fit pro max in it.,1
2,faded after 1 wash,0
5,"we loved the bonnets. They are well made and were perfect for a ""little house on the prairie"" party we went to. We will also be using them for frontier days and when ever else we can. My daughters loved them and they make for many great photo opportunities. they would also be great for a Holly Hobby party!",1
4,"I liked how warm but light it is.<br />Little short wish it was just a touch longer, but over all really like it.",1
5,"Need these everywhere! Great product, packaging and cases!",1
5,Smaller than I expected but still think they're adorable and like,1
1,Got two dresses at the same time and one was perfect the other too small.,0
3,It fit my daughter better than myself but nice quality.,0
4,Its comfy but I bought a medium size and it was bigger than I thought,1
3,Very cute~!!,0
1,Cute design but material way too thin for the price!!!,0
5,"nice thick chain, but not ridiculously thick.  Its not one of those chains that can stand alone, it needs a nice &#34;manly&#34; pendant to go with it.  I like the stainless steel chains, they are stylish, yet inexpensive for the working class.",1
5,new design...better peripheral vision/comfort,1
5,"I have had a key finder hanging on my purse for years and can't imagine life without one. They keys are always easy ro get to, no digging around in your purse.",1

5,"Looks good, clear picture, plastic but screws on well, they stay on during sleep and activities.",1
5,It‚Äôs a little longer than expected but I love the fabric and the color.,1
5,"I have a large head and I measured it before ordering this hat. It fits perfectly, I love this hat to keep the Sun off my face and neck while hiking and taking photographs. Keep in mind this hat is not crushable, and if you're traveling be careful when you're backing it in your suitcase. Otherwise it's very nice hat and not hot to wear. I highly recommend it.",1
5,Returned the glasses as I did not like the design.,1
5,"Muy buen producto, mejor de lo que me esperaba",1
1,Placement of ear loops make it impossible to wear without covering eyes. Not made to actually fit proper human anatomy!!  Cats love playing with it though,0
1,Poorly constructed with a big ugly logo and no room at all inside.,0

5,"Super cute band,  great quality!",1
2,"These shorts have an elastic band inside the top waist band that is smaller than the waist band itself. This creates a point that cinches in so that the shorts aren't smooth around your waist. The elastic band also isn't tacked down, so it rolls and twists freely inside the waist band.<br /><br />If these didn't have the elastic band in them, they would be very comfortable. The elastic band makes me want to set them on fire, perhaps while wearing them.",0
2,"The advertisement or add set black silver and gold, I got Rosico not what I wanted",0
3,tarnished in two days......sad,0
2,"It‚Äôs a cute mask, but it‚Äôs just super thin! Not worth $10 for ONE super thin mask. Mask is a little too big for my face as well, leaving open gaps on the sides. So on top of the mask being thin, the open spaces on the side of the mask makes me more paranoid with wearing this. If you buy, be prepared to double up in order to feel more secure.",0
5,I love the purse just the right size to go with my outfit,1
3,Runs small. I went by their chart and I should of went up a size.,0
3,okay,0
1,Earrings are not real silver. They are silver plated or coated and have started peeling. Such a travesty! Amazon should block this vendor or atleast revise their advertisement practices.,0
5,the material is nice and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. the dress is shaping especially at the waist,1

5,I got them for secret Santa gift. They look fantastic.,1
2,"The chin strap fit very awkwardly, and it was pretty tight. That would have bothered me so much but I just don't think it looked very good on me. Maybe without the chin strap, but I just returned it instead.",0
5,Very pretty and elegant looking. Nice gift for a 40th.,1

After reading the reviews, I purchased the size 48 (XL) hoping it would fit my body type.  This suit is made for someone with a longer torso and smaller breasts. Unfortunately, I have to return it.",0
3,Was great at first. Then with continued use the earrings started to fade and get really not nice looking. Disappointed.,0
4,"So cute! I got it as a gift for someone and she loved it. My only complaint is that the coloring is very off; it looms beige/tan in the image, but it is very pink in person. Other than Th t, works perfectly fine.",1
1,"This dress was so incredibly small my 10 year old couldn‚Äôt wear it. How disappointing when there‚Äôs a size chart to reference. The fabric looks and feels like a table cloth. Even had the dress fit, I wouldn‚Äôt have worn it.",0

5,Such cute and well made pajamas! My daughter loves them and I can't wait until she can wear them during the winter!,1
2,"I really like the look and feel of this shirt. Seems to be of better than expected quality for the price. However, the sizing is inaccurate. I ordered a 2xl and the fit would have been small for an XL. I really wish sizing was accurate.",0
3,Cute but and fit ok but started to fall apart in less than 24 hours. Lost a whole ear.,0
5,this is my third pair chep price and great,1
5,great sparkly earrings !!!,1
3,Loved the color the material was great but does is not true to size!!!! Got my size and didn't even go up my hips,0
5,Great purse. Just what I wanted!,1
1,Buckle came off9,0
3,This looked much cuter online than it did in person.  It was a bit smaller than expected and didn't fit my body well.,0
4,Pretty good. I have a fuller chest and this gave support workout creating a uniboob under my clothes. Can definitely use on most exercise machines like stepper and elliptical without fear. Haven't  really run in it myself but think it could hold up fairly well. Hard to find something that is as supportive for a full chest that is under $40. This is a good find.<br /><br />Please let amazon know if this review was helpful.,1

4,These fit great except the thigh area that is really tight when putting on. I have to pull them on but they don‚Äôt ride up once they are on. That are comfortable except getting them on with the tight thigh area,1
5,Fits nice and also is very comfy!,1
5,These socks are so comfortable and fit my feet perfectly!,1
5,"Ordered a Large.  I'm 5'8"" 140 lbs., 36D-36DD. This is how it fits.  Love it. Use it as undershirt for sweaters/sweatshirts and it doesn't bunch like cotton t-shirts. Slick material",1

2,Did not lay like in the picture - what a bummer.  Was loving this suit from the pics!,0
1,"The dress was way too small. When I requested a refund, I was offered 30% of what I paid and a suggestion that I give it to someone else who it might fit instead.",0
2,As soon as I put the first one on. The stitching was coming undone . Not a good sign,0
5,"This is a great sling bag. I love the color of mine. It fits everything I need for a busy mom on the run. The only bummer is that my iphone 7 plus does not fit in the pocket on the strap. I wish it did, but that's ok cause I can put other little things in it like gum and chapstick. I plan on using this for when I travel this summer and just for everyday use.",1
5,High quality,1
1,Bought for Christmas straps are breaking in march,0
5,Well made and as pictured,1
5,"These are so great! The designs are cute, the tights are durable. Love them. Will repurchase from this seller in the future.",1
5,"I ordered these cufflinks in late Jan 2015 and they arrived about a week later. Incredible, especially considering they place an expectation that they can be upwards of a couple months for delivery. My expectations were exceeded! The cufflinks arrived exactly as marketed. They have the look of much more expensive cufflinks as well. Considering the latter, I highly recommend INBLUE Jewelry.",1
4,Did not realize these were so small and dainty.  Perfect for a children.  They are beautiful.,1
4,Very flimsy see through material,1
2,This headband needs to be wider. It doesn‚Äôt do much to keep sweat from dripping off my forehead when I workout.,0
4,Could have a bit more compression.,1
4,Great Value...........fit as expected.  Nice quality,1
1,I ordered the multi colored heart glasses and they are pictured with silver frames and the ones that came are rose gold frames with multi colored lens,0
5,"I lost my first pair on the Metra, and, of course, they were never turned in (Ha).",1
5,These worked great for a long flight (Japan) I was very pleased with fit and comfort and would recommend these for travel.,1
5,That they actually run true to size. Comfortable material soft & not heavy.  Only regret is that you don't make them in 27'' inseam which I really needed.  All in all they are the best jeans I have been able to locate and wear.,1
5,The fit and quality of the rubber are very good. I'm going to recommend to my friends. I may order more for gifts.<br />Thanks HURETEK!,1
3,Cute shirt but it ran pretty small.  I like my shirts to be a little loose and flowy‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt5,0
2,"Although in theory these are a great idea, I had 2 major issues with them. First, the seams of some of these came apart in the first wash. Second, and more importantly, I have a reaction to the rubber on the inside of the socks. They make my skin break out in an itchy rash. Sensitive skin beware.",0
3,"The wallet is good however the zipper wasn't opening easily . So everytime we open it or close it, it gets stuck and hardly we can close/open it .",0
1,I bought these because they were a less expensive alternative to Crocs. Not worth the savings. I have three kids in different sizes. One still had Crocs that fit from last year. She has worn them all summer this year too and they are still holding up. My two kids who I bough these for didn't even make it half way through the summer. Not even worth it. I would rather spend the extra and get Crocs that I know will last.,0
4,"I owned a pair of Phoenix Short Lace boots three years ago and loved them so much I bought another pair. The newer pair doesn't have a side zip which I miss since I now have to lace them each time. I've had numerous compliments on them - the style, texture, and neutral quarry color that goes with almost everything. Thanks, Sorel for your consistent quality.",1
5,Nice quality fabric and fit is true to size 14.,1
2,Love everything about this coat but the zipper. It‚Äôs warm and fits great. The zipper on the other hand is garbage. I‚Äôve had this coat for 4 days and it keeps popping open from the bottom and then unzips from the bottom up. If they would have just used a fully metal zipper this problem could be completely avoided. Very disappointed.,0
3,"Holy snags! This sweater arrived with some huge snags already in the fabric. I pulled them through to the inside so they don‚Äôt show. The blue color is pretty and since it‚Äôs 100% polyester it has a nice sheen, but it‚Äôs not nearly as oversized and slouchy as I would have liked. Not bad, but not great either, fairly mediocre.",0
5,Great product,1
2,Cheap. Will break easily.... Probably before it arrives to your mailbox,0
2,They are beautiful but poorly constructed. The post immediately bent.,0
5,Bought as gift,1
5,Affordable and easily worn,1
5,I love it because very soft and fabric id real cotton. It likes muslin for baby you know. I wear XL generally. I bought XL but this is little bit big size for me. I don't want to change because it is pyjamas. You need iron before wearing.,1
3,This was good though the rope for the cross was much bigger than the other ropes so it didn't sit right on my wrist.,0
1,Cheaply made. Looked nothing like the photo.,0
3,"Beautiful print, didn't expect the material to be so shiny. Fit larger than expected.",0
3,"I‚Äôm usually a size 16 dress and ordered and XL. I felt like I was wearing a giant sack. Also, the pockets were 2 different sizes. I could easily slip 1 hand in, while the other was a little difficult.",0
5,it's awsome...,1
5,I love it make you look so pretty I like that way the pockets are discrete and I can have my phone without a bag the color is very pretty I got a bunch of complements,1
4,"Love love loves this dress, good quality material and well made. I recommend.",1
5,Love it,1
5,"I really like this puffy, but not too puffy!, men's duck down/feather coat by puredown, and so does my husband, for whom I ordered it. He has plenty of coats, but this one looked so thin yet warm I could not resist. Imagine my surprise when the coat arrived packed up in a nylon drawstring pouch about a foot long by about four inches in diameter!<br /><br />It really is amazing. I ordered him an extra large, one size larger than usual because often items ordered online run small and so the product page stated, thanks to the convenient size chart, and it fits perfectly. When removed from the pouch it quickly ‚Äúpoofs‚Äù back up for a nice fit and is very soft smooth/silky to the touch (both the pouch and the jacket). The outer shell is a nice nylon, the lining polyester, so this jacket will wash great, but only in cold water perhaps with a dark towel or two to help fluff it up in the dryer, but only on air or medium heat.<br /><br />It has not gotten really cold where I live yet, in the south, but I have no doubt this will prove to be very warm on nippy mornings and evenings. My husband plans to keep the jacket in his vehicle for emergency use. Oftentimes we go out in the daylight when it is warm or warmish, but the temperature drops after dusk. This jacket is perfect for just such times.<br /><br />Overall I can see no reason at this point to not give this jacket five stars. I think it is super cool that something like this can fit in a pouch not much bigger than a large thermos. Well done puredown!<br /><br />This item is a discounted sample provided by the vendor for review consideration.",1
5,This is a cleaner for gym shoes and has no fit involved???,1
2,"These run extremely small. It's to bad I have to return them because they are really cute and from what I seen, made pretty well.<br /><br />I was offered this item for a reduced price to leave the seller my HONEST review, in which I have done.<br />I will not leave a good review for a bad product regardless of discount. It in no way influences my judgement or opinion.",0
1,Item arrived broken and although an exchange is allegedly guaranteed within 5 days I need this tomorrow. No option for refund or to contact anyone directly.,0
1,"It arrived as a wrinkled mess. The fabric is awful, like the material you'd use for a flag or something. Not light & airy as in the picture, but thick heavy, non breathable stuff. I ordered the biggest size they have (I'm 5'4"", usually a XL, average to small chest) and I couldn't even get it over my shoulders/chest. Needless to say, it went back immediately. The best part about this was that they offered free returns.",0
5,Tal y como lo describen ..!!! Excelente !!,1
5,"This was a very good surprise!! I bought it based on reviews, put it on with bike shorts underneath, my husband got home to see me wearing it, and he said, &#34;Wow!&#34;. (Always happy to &#34;wow&#34; my incredible hubby!!)  It's a beautiful color (I got royal blue), the arm holes are cut high and fit as would be expected, it doesn't require a camisole unerneath, the dress has invisible pockets at the hips (They don't add any bulk to the hips at all), and the swing of the skirt is lovely! Totally positive purchase, and I would recommend this product to anyone. The price was very good, too! FAST shipping.",1
3,The place where the tie comes out of the seam looks awkward no matter what the size is.,0
4,Loved the print!,1
1,Sizing is way off. order at least one size up. My daughter is a 12.5 and couldn't even get her foot in the 13.,0
5,"Made out of  high quality cloth, very comfortable  fit.",1
4,It's very cute!,1
5,Love this sweater! Nice  colors and good quality.  Not thin at all,1
5,This was a beautiful skirt but it just did not fit how I wanted it to fit.,1
1,"I would never bug this product again . The shoe cleaner has stained my 2 month old triple white NMD's. I am extremely disappointed and i would make surei let  other people know not to use this on a white sneaker ever again. By far the worst product for a white sneaker . There goes $130 out the door ..... and nooo the shoe is not dirty i had cleaned it like 3 times and the &#34;cloth&#34; its what i think causing the problem, regardless the worst product in the market thank you crap protect",0
2,"These look very little like the photo. The pockets are tiny and the cut isn‚Äôt slim at all. They look like straight leg pajama pants. There is way too much room in the front and back around the hips. Also, there‚Äôs not enough fabric for them to bunch at the bottom. They are way too short and my son is short for his age. I have a feeling that this photo is from a designer but the clothes are being made elsewhere. The design is really nothing like the photo. The good news is that they are very soft and comfortable.",0
2,Didn't receive this tie - I received a different Maple Leaf tie but since it was a gift I didn't have time to return it. I wanted this one but got an ugly white one.,0
3,"Nice, thick, absorbent sweatband. However, definitely not as big as advertised. Must be for a very small head.",0
2,"I purchased this tank because I liked the way the sports bra underneath peeked out above the tank at the neckline. But it doesn't actually look that way when you put it on. The sports bra sits well below the tank and only shows a little at the sides (see photo). Also, they should just sell the tank and sports bra as a set and not actually sew them together. It's like a brain teaser to try to line them up correctly and then slip them both on together. Why?",0
1,I personally did not like the quality of the skirt,0
5,"Very cute. My cat-obsessed, 4th grader absolutely loves it.",1
1,Much shorter in length than picture.,0
5,I like the style of this one better than the popular 4 way. Its longer and I like the buttons.,1
5,Very nice item. Quick shipping. Happy with purchase!,1
5,Fits perfectly.  Only waiting for the summer lighter colors.,1
3,Se hacen feas en la lavada. Muy mala calidad la tela  se hace peluda,0
1,Cheap. Broke after wearing twice,0
5,Very nice and unique .,1
4,"These are what you expect. Thin fabric, no shelf bra, bright colors.  The cut is right and the adjustable straps are nice. I listened to reviews that said they run small and ordered a Large for my 12 yr old.  She is a typical skinny 12 yr old and generally wears about a size 10.  I should have followed the size chart and ignored the reviews.The large says it is a 14 and it fits like a 14.  I will keep them for her to grow into because you can never have too many foundation tanks and reorder a Med.",1
1,Cheap and stinky rubber. Misleading and overpriced.,0
2,"I'm 5'-8"" and dress drages on ground. Super thin material. Pretty print",0
3,This hat is very pretty. The color is exactly like the picture but the hat is not as big as it looks on the picture! It comes all flat and u have to work with it to make it look like the picture. After I worked with it for a couple of days t turned out to be a nice hat!,0
5,Looks very sophisticated and unique. I have received a lot of compliments whenever I wear this piece.,1
5,The key chains are heavier and more solid than I thought they would be. My wife really liked them.,1
4,mom loves,1
5,These are awesome yoga shorts. I love the length and the high waist. They are well made and even have nice mesh side pockets. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.,1
2,I got one that looks like the photo and one that is bigger and doesn't match,0
4,"These cord stoppers are a good size, love the colors and easy to use. I would sugesst making the spring a bit tighter.",1
1,One of the worst package I ever ordered. I want to return it but can‚Äôt rn because of the corona virus,0
5,Wearing during the month of October. I am a survivor.,1
5,Love this as a funny gift,1
5,Good leather.,1
5,Good Bibs and they serve the purpose.,1
2,Beautiful watch band however the pins are very flimsy and wouldn't even secure correctly. I bought a previous onw in a different color and it waa great. Not sure what happened.,0
2,Band was different from advertised no Fox Logo on it also there is no tint it‚Äôs clear so sun glare is a problem would have preferred tinted screen,0
1,Was way to small.picture was deceiving.  Very unhappy. Color was nice,0
5,Exactly what I was expecting.  Good quality.  Definitely recommend.,1
3,Cute but even too small for my almost 2 year old,0
5,Soooo cute!,1
1,it is nothing like the picture.. very cheap and the arm holes are barely wide enough to put your hand thru.,0
2,The picture posted with this frame clearly shows the words in &#34;yellow&#34;.....but they're actually in white...I'm disappointed I didn't get what was clearly pictured....and where are the bolts???.....90 bucks for a frame and you don't include mounting bolts that will fit the included bolt caps....VERY disappointed.,0
5,"I purchase 3 different Marino Men's leather ratchet belts in different colors and love all of them. The leather is supple, the buckles striking in appearance, and infinitely adjustable. Great product and highly recommended.",1
5,Love these glasses!!! so many compliments and got them SUPER SUPER SUPER FAST!,1
3,the straps came off as soon as I tried it on.,0
4,There ok,1
1,it was too small,0
3,"The suit is not bad and you can't beat the price.  However, the top seems very small. I ordered a large, because I typically have a difficult time finding tops that are big enough. I would say this suit would not fit anyone bigger than a B-cup. It seems to be made pretty well. If the top fit I would be completely happy with it.",0
5,"Such a beautiful dress, i definitely recommend! Im 5.2ft and got a medium, im super excited to get the chance to wear it!",1
2,"HUGE ! I dont think it matters what size you order , the fingers are gigantic and not shaped like real fingers. So you will need to alter this glove",0
3,"Runs small, was very tight around the chest area.",0
1,"This was made out of shiny cheap  material not fitted  no shape, horrible.",0
3,Loved the style. Loved the idea of it. But ultimately returned it because the speakers were too far apart and didn‚Äôt mine up with the ears.,0
1,A total waste of money.  The socks kept moving while walking so the slip pads end up on the top of your feet.  That is not good.,0
5,Love love love this dress!,1
4,The frames were a little large on my face but they are polarized and are stylish with actual bamboo arms (you can see the grain on them). At about $20 these are a good deal.,1
3,Wanted a dif tint,0
5,There is nothing I dislike about these straps. Perfect length on arm or short shoulder bag.<br />  My handbag has been sitting in my closet for quite sometime I couldn't find the right handles. Now I have!<br />  I really suggest these you won't be disappointed.,1
5,"So cheap I expected them to fall apart in a wash & dry cycle, but no. Over a year and these shirts still look, fit and feel great.",1
2,"I loveeee the fit, but these are wayyy too see through :-( I tried the blue and purple and it just didn‚Äôt help :-( . For size reference though,  I‚Äôm 5‚Äù11 250lbs and I got the XL. Maybe black would be better?",0
4,Cute!,1
1,"Somewhere in the product description it says this dress doesn't wrinkle after washing.  So, I thought that it wouldn't arrive looking wrinkled either.  What a mess!  It was horrible.  Even if I were inclined to spend the time steaming it, or hand washing it to remove the wrinkles, what would it be like to pack in a suitcase, or even just sit at a desk?  I totally couldn't trust that it would look good, and so I returned it.",0
1,"Es un bonito reloj, pero lamentablemente no funciona bien, hay momentos en que se detiene y hay que volver a ajustar la hora.",0
4,I liked the look of the shirt the quality and fit  was ok but something about it I just didn‚Äôt like on meü§î I sent it back with no problems.  I would buy something else from this seller in the future!,1
5,"It's comfortable and fits the way I wanted it to. I could wear it over a pair of jeans, or tucked into a skirt, which was why I bought it. Everyone thought it was super adorable. It's comfortable enough to wear to bed as well.",1
3,"Returning because it was too tight in shoulders and chest. I ordered an XS. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, weight about 120 lb and wear a 32DD. Material wasn‚Äôt bad, would be good for late fall.",0
3,"I like it, however one of the eyelets (holes for the watch strap), specifically the one I was using, seemed to start fraying almost right away. We will see how long it holds out. Since it is nylon, perhaps the solution is simply using a hot nail (or similar thin circular piece of metal) to melt the edges of the eyelet.<br /><br />I will note that the other eyelet I switched two seems to hold out ok so far, no fraying. Maybe it is just one of them.<br /><br />Aside from that, the band it very nice -- I love the colors and the fit is perfect. Looks great on my watch.",0
2,"Bought an xl, it fit  tooo snug, the neck  design looked like it should not have been there.",0
5,Good price and quality. Fits exactly as represented.,1
1,The necklace broke the second my girlfriend put it on and spun it around on her neck. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this necklace. I have never been more unsatisfied. Don't waist your money!,0
3,"I am 5 '4 and 125 lb. I have 2 other pairs in size extra small that fit great and are both squatproof with the right thong, however the color in forest green was not only see through when squatting, but they had a tag and was made of different material. The other 2 I have is steel blue, and the lightest pink. I'm very disappointed because they looked great until I squatted. Also the color is definitely less vibrant. Not like the photo.",0
1,Lo devolvi hubo una confusi√≥n de mi parte en el modelo,0
4,The dress is beautiful!  Although it fits a bit too tight it is because I'm overweight.  But I am keeping it.  If I loose 10 lbs it will be perfect.  I will be ready for it by spring to take it on a cruise.,1
5,Great.,1
1,This was way to small .,0
5,Awesome little shirt!,1
5,calidad precio es un buen producto. El material se ve  mejor en las foto pero esta bien,1
5,I purchased these gloves as a gift for my mother. She liked the way they felt on her hands and also they protected her them from the sun.,1
1,Melts very fast while handleing and turns sticky,0
3,"Very comfortable and look great, my only issue is that they aren't thick enough to not be see through... have to wear with a long shirt but other than that they're great",0
5,"Love these two-tone earrings! They fit perfectly and clip in easily. When they're on, they are so comfortable I forget I have them in.",1
5,Great for biking. Very light and protect the goods while on a ride. I have so many shorts and skirts that I could wear if I had some padding. These were great. Sized up as I used their chart.,1
1,Chain was so cheap it broke with first time wearing it. My daughter is so disappointed as am I. She worked lots of chores to earn this and it was pretty junky. The pendant itself she loves- but they should provide extra chains if they're going to sell such cheap chains with it.,0
3,You get what you pay for. It is very cute and if I had a teen or pre-teen I would gift it to them. I have to take one for the team on this one.,0
5,This vest is so soft and washes very well.. I hung it in to dry for first washing it came out just fine. Be advised u may feel pretty in this bc I know I did. It fits very well and size is accurate. Nothing like buying something online and it being just as described. Perfect item for vest wearers.,1
5,"It's very nice and cute, i like it.",1
5,i love this ring,1
2,"This rings nice, but do not hold on the nose well.",0
2,Not a good fit but pretty shirt,0
5,These glassse were quite honestly great and I would recommend them to anyone.,1
5,This bra adds just enough lift and padding.  Very comfortable too. I will buy either colors.v,1
3,"Uncomfortable, the waistband is too tight. A large should be more than ample on me.",0
1,"I ordered the largest size possible, it comes all misshapen, very very thin and stiff, It will get donated to charity. Don't waste your money, not to mention it took forever to get here",0
5,"Great, as expected",1
2,"The graphics are absolutely amazing, unfortunately, the quality of the material is poor. It might be fine for beginners or people who don't train much, but for those of us who train 3+ days per week, the material simply does not hold up.",0
5,"Great for quickly stepping up your style level when wearing suits.  This variety pack gives you more then enough options to match/contrast any shirt & tie combo. Quality is surprisingly good. I was afraid they would be the shiny, obviously cheap looking finish, but was pleasantly surprised they don't look that way.  Definitely worth the price.",1
1,Broke the first day,0
3,My cat run from it.,0
3,"I ordered the patterned scarf. The pattern did not match the display. The color scheme was similar but the pattern was not quite right. In fact, I thought the pattern on the scarf I received looked chintzy,  I also found the scarf to be to short and stiff to work with. I was expecting more of tshirt stretch but this particular scarf was more like a stiff jersey blend.  I did like that the borders are all hemmed but overall it just did not meet my expectations.",0
5,Love this two piece set! It‚Äôs super comfortable and fashionable. Good for working out or just to wear out.,1
5,Love the braclet!  Very quick shipping.,1
5,The dress fits perfect to size.  Looks as great on ne as on the hanger.,1
3,"Maybe this is my fault for not reading the description completely. But, I did not realize this tie cannot be tied. It comes instead with an elastic band to secure it.It looks like it's tied, unless someone tugs at it and sees it has elastic. This is for me nephew in high school, where kids tug at your ties.",0
1,It's an ' ok' sweater.,0
2,The grey colored shirt was super scratchy feeling. The blue and black felt soft. Overall i didnt like the fit too much.,0
5,Great Quality and gorgeous dress!,1
5,"I love this strap. I got it for my newly acquired vintage Gruen Curvex watch. I remember being mesmerized by my Dad's Speidel watch strap in the 70s, and wanted one like it that reminded me of him. I had no idea these were still made, and I'm so glad they are! Thanks for brining back the memories of my Dad Speidel!!!",1
3,"Very fabric, liked the dress but the chest area is smaller and the high neck is a little tight.",0
1,Cheap product get what you pay for broke in 2 days .,0
5,"Great charm, can change from bracelets to bangles really easy",1
3,"I purchased the large which is equivalent to US medium [size 8]. I am 5'8&#34;, 145lbs, 34DD. The fit was great and the dress was made from really nice stretchy material. I couldn't get past the pouf shoulders. My sons told me that I looked like a pilgrim. Yup. I returned it. I do have the other Miusol dress that matches this color scheme: Miusol Women's Vintage Polka Dot Neck 1950'S Classical Slim Cap Sleeve Evening Dress. That dress I LOVE.",0
5,love it,1
1,i had bought this becuase i saw it on tv thinking it was going to be great but soon as i recieved the item it was a fake i could of tell because on the box t said simular as on tv,0
5,Yes,1
5,Best fitting hat I've ever owned,1
1,No support...not what expected,0
2,Sizing is completely inaccurate...size you order is definitely NOT the size that arrives.  Not true to size...way too small.,0
2,"I should have know that this necklace was too good to be true. Unfortunately, the cheap price matches the quality. I wasn't expecting too much; I was hoping the necklace would look like the picture and would serve as cute costume jewelry. However the color tone does not look like the picture and the chain itself looks extremely cheap. You get what you pay for.",0
5,LOVE IT. Soft material. NOT see thru...will order again. True to size.,1
5,I loved this so much that I just ordered 4 more in different colors.,1
5,Quality and what I was looking for.,1
2,"The dress is super cute however, the fabric is a weird material. It felt like a waterproof sleeping bag material.",0
5,I doo love it! It's very comfortable and very pretty. Happy I bought it. I will be buying more from BCR.,1
5,The quality is GOOD. I will be ordering again when I do lose weight. Thank you!,1
1,I don't lake,0
1,"Loved them when I first put them on. So comfy. Then, after the first wash the mesh stitching started to rip. After only the second time washing them, the mesh stitching completely fell apart and I had to toss them. Very poor quality.",0
1,Day 5 of having it in my pocket already dropping color dye.,0
3,"Usually I wear a large, and athletic shirts in that size fit me pretty tightly, so I purchase XL thinking they'd be a little looser. Not so in this case. When I opened them I thought I'd received the wrong size, but the tags said XL. They look like a tight medium and fit me like a second skin. I showed them to a friend and asked what size she thought they were. She said Medium. They're fine for me to wear under other workout shirts, but I didn't intend to layer them with other clothes.",0
5,Loved it. Used it for groceries and diet meal plans.,1
1,did not look realistic at all,0
3,"So, I custom ordered this dress in my size. I spoke with customer service and they took my size. I would say that they have good customer service and responded ASAP. However, upon trying on the dress, the waist is too wide and needs to be synched in and the arms are waaaaay too tight and small. I have large upper arms so, I will need to just have the arms removed. Its ashame. Other than that, the dress is lovely and is of better quality than I expected.",0
2,Looked like crap like it had black gunk all over it.,0
3,"I‚Äôm giving these tank tops 3 stars because they do fit as expected however, I specifically ordered them because they were described as ‚Äúcompression‚Äù tank tops. They are not compression tanks at all. They are simply a thin poly/spandex blend. They are still great for working out but not exactly the type I was looking for.",0
2,Runs about two sizes too small.,0
1,poor quality.,0
1,I couldn't use this product the size chart is not right i went up 3 size bigger very unhappy,0
4,Perfect for swim wear cover up,1
3,Much bigger than I expected- too large for my tiny 18 year old neighbor,0
3,I actually loved this suit. If fit well and was flattering with out looking grandma ish. But it is cheaply made and the one strap was not swen at all and the other was so loose it couldn't stay up. I returned it. I did order another one in hopes for a better one.,0
5,It looked like the picture. At other online retailers a similar fascinator cost up to $50; so I was pleasantly surprised that this looked as cute as it did for the cost.,1
5,Nice shirt,1
5,They are adoorable~,1
3,"I bought the 12x8 size hoping to have a holder for my iPad and its accessories.  There is a pocket on the back of this organizer, but the zipper is about a third of the way down so the iPad doesn't fit inside.  There is no place in this organizer to enclose the iPad itself.",0
1,The floral print on the dress i recieved is nothing like what is pictured. The dress is cute but if you order one thing and receive another it is upsetting.,0
5,They did the job they were suppose to do,1
5,"It is long like the other reviews say - which was amazing for me!  I'm 6' and the XL actually hits the floor! ü§Ø First jumper that's ever done that.  I'm gonna buy another for sure.  PS - the blue is much lighter in person (like a cornflower blue, almost lavender)",1
2,terrible sewing,0
2,"Very light, almost seems cheap, but you get what you pay for",0
5,"Worth the money, Good plastic.",1
3,"It's made out of nice material and didn't have smell like others have mentioned. However, it doesn't cover my mouth and nose as expected because of it being too large for my head. I tried to adjust with the strings but it doesn't hold very well and just goes right back to hanging under my chin. Definitely not what I was hoping for. Maybe I had the wrong idea of how this thing was supposed to work - so that may be my own fault completely. Either way, not pleased with my purchase. I think this would work better for a bulkier man than a short semi-petit woman.",0
4,Runs small,1
4,The OliaSports Make America Great Again unisex Adult Adjustable cap is very well made.  It has a adjustable band in the back to change the size to fit your head. The stitching is well done and lettering is bright and pops.  The hat is a trucker style hat.  The red with white lettering really stand out.<br /><br />Disclaimer ‚Äì I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion and review. No compensation was received for this review.,1
5,Such an ingenious little invention! Far better than my old traditional rack! Love these!!,1
3,"Washed once inside out in cold water and hung to dry. Graphic already peeling. Hoodie is nice though, so I'll likely peel graphic off and use my Silhouette to add something else.",0
3,I got this ring for my girlfriend because she really wanted a princess crown promise ring she loves it but only problem it turns skin green but she found a solution for it she put a coat of clear coat nail polish on the ring leaves a barrier for skin and ring,0
3,"They are nice but bigger than they appear, my mom did not like them because the size is not the same as advertised.",0
3,"watch looks great and feels great.  Light.  Band is small for me.  Only thing I do not like is that after a couple of days of not wearing it, I have to wind the watch and set dates.  Getting it running again can be a little difficult as the hands don't want to turn",0
3,"I wear a 34DD and the size fits but it doesn't hold up properly, if it came with halter straps it would look a lot better.",0
4,Very nice . Fits pretty good but a little busty by the chest.,1
3,"The material is much heavier than I expected. However, it can be worn in early Spring when the days are cooler.",0
1,"Would not hold time, tiny size.  Don't buy into the hype unless you have a child's wrist.",0
3,"Overall I Like it. The elbow pads are a little weird, and it was poorly sewn. There was a 2 inch seam hole. I will fix it myself, but a bit of a bummer to not be able to wear it right away.",0
5,Just the earrings I have been looking for.  Easy to insert and wear.  Gold plated sterling silver with no nickel.  Quick delivery.,1
2,It‚Äôs not as long as it‚Äôs advertised to be,0
1,not what I expected,0
3,The material is very flimsy - not heavy like it looks online.,0
4,This product was easy to apply as I followed the instructions. Although the product did not last as long as I liked it. I had to re-apply every 2 hours. Still a viable product to use for my glasses.,1
5,I love that this is a toddler shoe that actually fits a toddler‚Äôs chubby foot. I read in reviews that Diadora is boxier for wider/thicker fit. This is true and great for allowing room for thick soccer socks.,1
5,"Easy install, looks just like you would expect. The strap is a good length for me, and it seems very durable so far.",1
1,Not a great product,0
5,"Anyway,I buy one of this every two yrs. This is my third one. Love it",1
3,"I'm 5'3, 155 lbs, 36"" bust, 32"" waist and 42"" hips. Im normally a size L but I ordered a M after reading the reviews. The dress was way too long and loose. Its a nice dress but it would look better on a tall curvy girl.",0
5,This necklace gets compliments everywhere I go!!! It's so attention grabbing and absolutely beautiful!!! It's worth so much more than the price it's listed for! SUCH A STEAL!!!!,1
1,"Has hard plastic on inside near arch, very uncomfortable",0
5,Love them I wanted to buy another pair and the price went up boo-hoo,1
1,Not even the item shown. Smaller than it looks and feels very cheap.,0
4,Good,1
5,"I will be ordering this in different colors, awesome product.",1
3,Not the best fitting.,0
5,O M G!!! I Absolutely love this dress. I was skeptical  too. It feels fantastic on and I dont feel uncomfortable! It's a perfect dress for night out. It hides all flaws and material is excellent.  I wear size 12. The size large I perfect.  I might need to get this dress in every color now,1
2,Got all the pieces but only lasted one day.. don't waste your money. Gold fades away.,0
3,"Material was not what was expected - shiny plastic like - fit was good, and it's ok for a house dress",0
4,These tanks are great for the gym.  Take note that these are fabric mesh and not regular pima/soft cotton.  Felt initially a little scratchy. Got better after a wash.  Hoping they don‚Äôt shrink.  I like tanks med or large.  Got these in large and very glad I didn‚Äôt go smaller!,1
5,"I am normally a ross gal, and never spend this amount on one shirt. I decided to treat myself since I have been looking at it for over a year. I am glad I did! It is so cute and flattering!<br /><br />I am 5'2. I would say I am more torso than legs. I am between 130-135lb and purchased a Medium.",1
1,Its junk not worth your money,0
1,Upon opening my order I saw a shirt that was super light and faded looking. If you want a shirt with any colors filling the entire shirt then go for it.,0
3,"The leggings are soft and fit just fine but they started ""pilling"" (getting the little balls on them) and look pretty rough after only three washes. Pretty disappointed but they work for chill days at home.",0
4,Nice shirt a little big. I am 5'4&#34; 150lbs and ordered an xl. Wish I would have ordered a large. But it is ok I don't like tight clothing.,1
1,Item description should specify that it's only for one snap not two.  Price is for retail of two snaps (a pair).  Had to return since I have two feet!,0
3,The shirt didn't really have any compression and that is the reason I bought them. Will not buy again.,0
5,Thank you,1
5,"Really pretty, quite an attention getter, great gift.",1
5,"I'm 5ft.9 180 lbs the tag says size 3xl, loose fit. Great length.  Could go a size down for a tighter fit. They stretch out after wearing a bit. Not waterproof, I'd call them water resistant. Warmer than jeans but not as warm as typical snow pants. Love the zipper pockets. They're kind of like a softshell jacket for your legs.",1
5,I wore this jumpsuit for a long flight- was SO comfortable yet stylish!  I love it!,1
5,"I ordered the women's size and it fits perfect.  It's a bit on the heavy side but tightening the elastic that goes around your ears help it fit better.  Just pull the two ends on either side to tighten.  Easy peasy.  I can at least breathe in this mask.  I live in a state that mandates masks.  I refuse to wear one when I go anywhere because they DON'T work and have yet to be told to put one on.  However,  if I am forced to wear one for what ever reason, I at least have this.  If more and more of us stopped wearing the face muzzles, maybe this nonsense would stop.",1
1,Did not look like pictures and looked so cheap... horrible buy ):,0
5,Sturdy & cute!,1
5,Bought this dress for my husband's upcoming holiday party was nervous due to their not being any reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and excited once it arrived and got to try it on,1
5,"Beautiful set but not sterling silver as advertised. The price is great! You just have to care for it as you would costume jewelry. Unfortunately, I spritzed perfume on my neck which ruined the necklace so I purchased a second set.",1
1,I got a large and it fits like xxxs,0
3,Loved them especially for the price. Unfortunately the larger earrings came broken. I realized it too late when I had already warn the other pair and threw out the packaging.,0
5,This was a gift for a co-worker just diagnosed with breast cancer and she loved it. It has the right meaning and mind set without broadcasting it to the world at a time she wasn't ready to. But she really loved it and made sure to wear it so it could be admired.,1
5,"I feel like I stole this, I got it for $36, but features and materials-wise this jacket is easily a $300+ jacket.  The face has nice stretch and you can tell that it is mapped with two different weights of insulation.  The pockets are well done, with the exception of the one on the left sleeve, it would have been nice if it were a little bigger.  There is maybe room for some gum and chapstick.  This will be a nice warm jacket for when you're moving around outside.",1
4,Cute shirt for the price and I may order another in different color.,1
5,Just perfect üëåüèΩ,1
4,Super cute and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them. I am kinda upset they both face one direction so one earring will have the snake facing your neck and not outward but I still love them.,1
1,This is crappy,0
5,"Great summer dress, with pockets! The material is on the thinner side, but not see through if you order according to the size chart measurements.  It goes all the way to the floor, and I'm 5'5"", so definitely a true maxi dress.",1
2,These may fit a western child or very skinny teenager but not a grown mam/ chef. What a joke! Who measures these things ?,0
5,It went great with my dress,1
4,"Me gust√≥ el dise√±o, sin embargo, la tela es muy delgada y se transparenta un poco.",1
5,"Beautiful, it was a gift and my friend loved it!!",1
5,I got it for my friend...and she loved it.,1
5,"Purchased this item as a gift for my step daughter. She is 23 and loves the fabric, the fit, and the style. Extremely satisfied with this purchase.",1
2,"I buy all my dresses from this maker in the same size, in fact bought 3 different with this order, however the yellow and black version was WAY smaller than the other ones. Unsure if it was mislabled or not. I cut off the tags before putting on since i THOUGHT i knew my size in this dress since i have about 10 of them in different colors - so cant return. Size up in this dress if you are a regular buyer.",0
2,"Ran a little small... was afraid after washing it might shrink... really cute and nice material, but had to return",0
5,"Very cool, good quality",1
5,Thank you Amazon and Northface it fits me well and keeps me warm,1
4,Great bra for the support. I really like the bottom being extra long. It is very snug and great for working out.,1
4,I only got 29 rings and 1 single ball but other then the 1 missing ring I love all the different colors,1
2,would work fine if it fit,0
3,I like the product but it gets caught on my clothes a lot,0
4,For Titanium it seems hevy but exactly what I wanted in a watch.<br />This is not a quality or fuction review but I liked the look.,1
5,"It's very nice built and small enough to be on me most of the time.<br />No extra useless features, just exactly what I need.<br /><br />Love it glad I bought it.",1
4,"I ordered the black halter top suit. The top is excellent. I think it's super cute and the XXL was a good fit (I'm a 38 D). I found the wider straps super comfortable and flattering. I didn't love the bottoms as much, they did fit I just wish they'd have gone a little higher on me. I'm a size 12-14 and 5'8&#34;if that helps.",1
3,Fit was ok but a little to short for my taste and paper thin.,0
2,"Love this tee soft fabric however it does run on the smaller size, update-after washing it once the shirt got a big whole under the sleeve very dissapointing",0
4,The color and size of the keychain are as advertised. I expected it to be a ball but it is a flat circle. I still love it though.,1
5,"I ordered this organizer my eyeshadow & it was the perfect solution! They fit perfectly onto each other, and the case is an amazing space saver. Received my package as described in three days! I am very satisfied.",1
2,The broke after 3 days of wearing it.,0
5,Loved it!!!!  Already had a pair of jeans that had the same design. Paired perfectly!!,1
3,"I have only wore the band 2 1/2 hours and I have put the jewelry back on twice. I love the way it fits and the colors go with a lot of my clothing but to have to put the jewelry back on really bites. I could leave it off but I bought it for that reason, it was simple yet very cute",0
2,"Coat was very cute, but it was way too small. I usually wear a L so I ordered an XL and it was way too tight. Too bad it doesn't come an bigger.",0
5,Warm and comfortable.  Layered over grey turtleneck and was great!,1
5,Perfect fit. Would buy again.,1
1,It was too small and felt uncomfortable.  I placed the order for my normal size but for some  reason it was too tight.,0
2,"Ok let me start by saying #1, it is a cute top, and #2, I don't mind a heavy shirt most times. But there's weight that usually means quality, and then just plain heavy. This shirt was just plain heavy, not even slightly breathable. It's also a bit on the short side (nowhere even close to long enough for leggings if you're average height or taller) and shows every imperfection despite such a heavy material. I find it's really not comfortable at all. Bought 2 in my usual size based on their size chart and they were both too small. I ended up returning one and exchanging the other for a larger size. I love the pictures of it and was so bummed it didn't work well for me.",0
5,"Love the shirt, true to size and sexy.",1
5,"At $29.99 this is an outstanding value. I have shopped for similar bras that cost $40 each! With the 5 pack, each bra costs about $6. These are as nice as anything I have seen in the $40 range. I wear a bra size 44DDD, and the 3XL fits perfectly. Note that I would not use this bra for strenuous exercise - walking is about as strenuous as I get. I wear it when I want to get out of my super-support wire bras, or for sleep at night.",1
5,These are great for under my scrubs. Fit like a second skin and breathable. I and 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 155lbs athletic build medium fits me just right. The sleeves are slightly short but I have very long arms so I am used to that. Over all I plan to order some more for work,1
5,Very nice patriotic pin.  Looks expensive.,1
5,Nic s leather strap,1
1,Stopped working due to water after only two weeks.,0
5,"What I like about this shirt is the material, its soft, fits well, the designs are very cute. All shirts I have purchased from this seller are great quality shirts, they don't shrink after washing or drying and it doesn't fade out. Its true to its size. Totally recommended.",1
3,"These are a good quality and fairly long but the size was a little too small.  Fortunately they have free returns so I will send them back and get the next size up.  A little pricey, but pretty much all I can find at this time of year in navy.",0
3,They look really good and flattering. But feel kind of thin. I definitely don‚Äôt trust them fully when I‚Äôm working out in them. I‚Äôve only washed them a handful of times but some of the threads  are coming undone.,0
3,"I bought this without realizing it had a gold-finish. That was my fault and I should have looked closer. I am not a gold or fake-gold fan so I ended up donating this set to Goodwill. To the manufacturer - Could you please make more silver-plated jewelry? These pieces are so gorgeous, it stinks that they are mostly fake-gold.",0
5,"They are very soft, won't be wearing for a while though, has been so hot here! Will wait till the temperature drops a little but look forward to wearing them as they are very soft and have a little weight to them so will be perfect for the fall weather.",1
5,Very comfortable and I've been wearing these everyday to work I'm a electrician and have to do demolition of walls to run wires these been going strong no rips nothing already 2 months and still going strong looking new after a good wash,1
5,[[VIDEOID:729bcea880bf2440dccc38399af45627]] Nice soft easy to zip and warm,1
5,Love this handbag. Got it after summer so will start carrying it in the spring.,1
1,"I had to return this because it would not adjust to my Soprano Ukulele. It looked like it would have worked on a larger instrument, but the reason I purchased it was that it stated it could fit it.<br /><br />The thing might be good, but just wasn't good for me and my needs.",0
5,I ordered the Black - Tinted Lens. Love the look. I used them in the ocean and had no fogging and they fit comfortably.,1
4,Ordered a small. Just ordered another in xs because small fits like a medium. I‚Äôm 5 foot 3 113 lbs athletic build. Going to compare both.,1
2,"good, traditional fit but the material was so stiff it was not a good feeling against my skin. had to return.",0
5,S√∫per loooooooveeee my new glasses! Please see the picture so you can see it for yourself!,1
3,Not for long torso or large breasts...the waist sits unnaturally high. I am a 34ddd and I will keep it because it was cheap...but not what I hoped for at all,0
1,My medium shirt came with one medium sleeve and one large sleeve!,0
1,Wayy too small didn't even fit in my fingertips. Claims to be size 4. Has to be size 3.,0
5,My son and grandson both wear these.  They love them. I have purchased a couple of times.  Great price and great product.,1
5,Came quick and in great condition,1
2,NOT AS NICE LOOKING AS THE PICTURE.,0
4,Should be on bother sides. These are cheap to make.,1
5,Love the way this headband feels and stays in place! Bought for motorcycle trips and it's amazing!,1
1,The face where the clover is fell off in just days. Looks like a quality product but it didn't last one week.,0
5,Bought for 4&6 year olds.  Fits well.  Don't see it fitting an adult though.  They are perfect for kids.,1
5,This dress looks and feels amazing! It fit perfectly and the sizing is on point!,1
5,"I love these sunnies!  I put them on and the whole sad world is happy and sparkling!  They make you look happy - feel happy and are just simply great HAPPY sunnies!  The fit is over-sized which is exactly what I ordered them, received the and love them!  They are NOT heavy - they are semi-sheer acrylic like and look fabulous..WOW - whaT GREAT SUNNIES - THEY ARE A BREATH OF SUNSHINE, TOO!  a TOTAL WINNER!  They are making the world look optimistic as well as saving your eyes from the summer or winter sun!",1
5,I just Love this piece I get so many compliments when I where it...I'm really glad I purchased it. :-),1
3,It was soft the design was as expected but the fit was odd on me and it was big enough to do what it was suppose to do which was be off shoulder on one side,0
2,I'm returning this because the back is very odd to fasten. It's also very small and the lining is thin.,0
5,Bulky,1
5,My wife gets more comments about this than any of her thousand dollar necklaces.  Beautiful.,1
5,The top part is tight but it flows nicely.  I am 4‚Äô10‚Äù. Need to shorten.,1
5,"These are the perfect size for a tragus piercing. After years of wrestling the backing out of the way when putting in earbuds, I decided to buy much shorter studs and see how they worked. They are a bit tough to put in without a mirror and/or someone to help you. At first I didn't think the back would be long enough, but once on they are the perfect length.",1
1,Says ten tie clips but o only received 7.,0
5,"This is such a pretty, delicate, small watch. My daughter fell in love with it! She has had it for about 2 months and it still looks brand new!",1
3,"From the photo it looks like the blue beads are more green than they really are. They are more of a baby blue color which unfortunately I can't match with much. I ended up taking them apart, removing the blue beads and adding with more neutrals. I also made them smaller because they are quite long.",0
1,Way to small I would go up 2 sizes of your gonna order.,0
3,Much smaller than I anticipated. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest buying if you‚Äôre a size 16+.,0
1,Just no. Don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs all wrong. I‚Äôd post a picture but you‚Äôd see all of my boobs out in the open.,0
5,[[VIDEOID:a7d86d01d97b28276918ee326c4812e6]] I enjoyed all the colors that came with this package. The bands are durable and easy to install. I‚Äôm waiting for the opportunity for this company to put together another package deal with brighter neon colors.,1
4,"I love, love, love these boots. I've also purchased a pair in black. FYI, they DO run large. I usually wear an 8, and that's what I ordered. They're a little big, but not so much that I can't wear them. Also, I have a high arch and wide feet and these work great. I may buy more.",1
5,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 tall, so it‚Äôs awesome to have a bunch of midi skirts that aren‚Äôt short on me! This is a great deal and they are very soft and not see through. :) Also they shipped to me faster than the expected delivery date",1
3,It's a nice bodysuit unfortunately for me it was way to big I'm 5'4  34D and 125 lb I ordered a small size and it was huge i was so sad because it is a really nice piece of clothing but size is off,0
1,It broke the first time i wore it,0
1,"Beautiful lace but it was stitched so tightly that there was absolutely no give. Needless to say, I am not small but I was transformed into looking like a man. And then who needs such heavy padding when you are already endowed, a light lining would have been nice. Why do bra companies insist on using such thick padding?<br />After checking out the bras I decided to removed the pads and cut off the lace, and then I got a much better fit. Not as pretty but now they are wearable. Also on the next order I will go up a size.<br />Wish I could have exchanged them but it wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle to send them back.",0
2,My fault for not reading the specs. Belt is waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy smaller than expected. I'm not referring to fit. Fits because it's stretchy. The width is just........ Was just........ Surprising.,0
1,$1300 for sterling silver cufflinks plated with gold? Absurd!,0
5,My daughter loved it and the response she got from family and friends after posting her picture with it on Social Media.  It looks real and has been easy for her to put it on and take it off.  As a parent am pleased that she went with the fake version.,1
5,Fits perfect. Looks nicer than a basic single color shirt.,1
5,Soft and Sleek.,1
2,not close to any originals,0
3,"fit large, more for man than woman.",0
3,"Size chart was wrong, dress didn't even fit over my arms.",0
5,Love it! Great conversation piece.,1
5,Wanted to order several more. They're out of my size!,1
2,This thing is garbage - probably why it's only 4 bucks (should be free). Nobody can tell there are shells in it - just a tacky piece of opaque blue plastic.,0
1,Very cheap quality and does NOT fit I even sized up when I ordered and it is way to small and cheap as crap feeling!,0
1,We only received the top,0
5,"I liked this assortment of charms better than before , I make my own jewelry and plan on selling it at the flea market",1
3,It‚Äôs very heavy,0
5,it's so nice,1
4,"They picture was not clear on whether these were the lenses with round sides or the angle side.  These are the rounded edges.  They are identical to teh original lenses but it does not say ""smyth"" on the lense.  They are easy to install and I like the color- its not too dark and not to light.",1
5,"Very nice dress for $8! Jersey type material and it fits well. Hugs all the curves. I got a red one (ooo la la) and I noticed that I would need nude undergarments for them to not be seen through the fabric. The dress hits me just above the knee and for reference I am 5'3, 130lb and I got a small. Easily can be dressed up for night out or dressed down for a casual day! Love it!",1
3,I ordered 2 pairs one a 10 girls too little 1 a 6 toddler too big sizing is not accurate,0
3,"This suit is cuter than I expected from the front.  The ruffled shoulder straps  can camouflage big upper arms.  The keyhole opening in the front is small and tasteful.  The only breast support is floating, removable pads.  I never prefer this to an actual shelf bra, but in this suit, because of it having a high waist seam and adjustable ruching between the breasts, there is not much room for the pads to ""roam"" and they pretty much stay in place.  The suit is fully lined with a soft, stretchy white knit fabric.  What makes this unwearable for me is the design of the back.  I am a little overweight and the back design accentuates my back fat in a nice package with a bow on top!  Oops, definitely not designed for me.  Not much support and highlights back fat.  It these are not issues for you, it's a cute, inexpensive suit.",0
3,"The Hugitout Women's Natural Cowrie Shell Bracelet is a rather cute bracelet that I think you will either like for casual wear or just plain hate. I gave it to my girlfriend to try out and she did not like it one bit.  It does come in a nice pink flannel bag. The bag will make for a nice gift package, but that all will end rather quickly if the bracelet is not liked.<br /><br />I think the bracelet would appeal more to a teen than most adult women.  I think I am generous in giving it 3 Stars. There is no price listed at the present; so I can not say whether it is a good deal or not. Also as I said, I think this is basically cute costume jewelry, designed more with a teenager in mind.<br />Thanks!",0
4,The ring arrives quickly. The fit and look are good. The only thing that I critic about the ring is the bottom of the United States Marine band is a bit sharp to the touch. Could be rounded off more to prevent snags.,1
2,"bad fitting, you get what you pay for",0
5,LOVE this dress!!!! I love all of Homeyees dresses! I get a medium in them all and they are form fitting for the most part which I like. I get compliments everyday at the office when I wear a Homeyee dress. this one had a little more room in it but still great!,1
3,"the buckle that holds the fastener together came off in 2 minutes, held on with a staple!  other than that its holding up for now... very cheap though!",0
1,The chaine was discolored not happy,0
5,Le quedo perfecto a mi hijo y es muy calientito para el invierno.,1
1,"I ordered the color white 1, and it does not look anything like the displayed picture.  When i chose the color white 1, the display picture looked beige, so I thought that is what it would look like.  When i received it, the jacket was white.  It is very soft, have lining in the the back and on the inside of the sleeves.  The lining on the sleeves is longer than the sleeves when i wear it.  It does not look professional.  It looks very casual.  I ordered a size medium and it did fit.  The medium fits close, so if you do not want it to close too your body order up a size.",0
1,"I bought 2 and returned one. Both balls of fur detached. Upon wearing it, the ball of rabbit fur fell off. They did not properly sew it on tight enough. I only kept 1 and re-sewed it myself.  Cheap labor for something so expensive.<br /><br />UPDATE: For the past 2 months, I have been sick with a nasty chronic cough and bronchitis. I've been on antibiotics, steroids, and antacids from acid reflux. I couldn't figure out my problem UNTIL THIS...<br /><br />If it weren't for a dog jumping at me and ripping this fur ball from his mouth, I would not have FOUND THIS NASTY JUNK STUFFED WITH LINT, PLASTIC, WHICH WAS FILLED WITH DUST, MOLD, HAIR, AND probably more than what I would like to know. I wore this every day to keep myself warm.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE: THINK TWICE WHAT YOU ORDER FROM AMAZON. MOST OF YOUR ORDERS ARE MADE IN CHINA.",0
1,These are really uncomfortable FOR ME.,0
3,"Love dress, lots of compliments BUT if you sit to long, it makes white marks as in a wrinkly look. I will order a second one.",0
3,"I purchased this as a gift for my aunt who loves to read. Although I think she will like the scarf, I was a little disappointed with the quality. I wish the fabric as more natural and less polyester-ish.",0
4,"It's food, but I can't state it's reliability. YET.  They offer a ""free"" canopy, but it is ""no longer available "". Say that they will instead send a free cover, we will see.",1
1,Noooooo. Cheap cheap cheap,0
1,"I usually wear a large.  Based on other user reviews, I ordered an XXL because it came from China.  Oh my!  I barely could get my arms through the sleeves. And if you have a bra size larger than an A cup, forget about it.  This is definitely made for tiny framed females.  Too bad because I think it's so pretty!",0
2,I guess somehow i missed the petite part.  It was way too tiny for me.,0
2,The product didn‚Äôt stay in place. Ended up losing because it fell out,0
5,"These leggings are amazing, super soft and not see thru at all. Honestly about to order another pair.",1
5,"I needed ONE to fix my watch.  Even though I got 360 pins, this was the cheapest way I could find to fix my watch.  And now, I will have watch pins for the rest of my life, with some left over that my kids will inherit in the distant future.",1
2,"Read all the questions about coloring bc in pic Jersey looks looks cream and burgundy which is why I brought it but it's not that color at all. Its bright white red, royal blue",0
5,Love itüòé,1
4,Wife loves it!,1
2,"These are not shaped like real aviators, strong and durable for the money though.",0
4,At first my daughter loved it but after 2 wash it started to look worn. The color was not as vibrant as before.,1
3,"I am short (5'1) so this hits at a slightly awkward length for me... it's too short to be a dress but looks a bit long even with leggings. The waist band is also not very stretchy, so measure accurately. The fabric is also quite thin. I'm hoping the length will shrink up after a few washes.",0
1,It's nothing like the picture it's doesn't lace up in the back it's not satin at all,0
3,Suit had a hole in the fabric on the day it arrived and it's not long enough for my body. It's meant for short people and doesn't have a great amount of stretch. I'm still using it because it's the only bathing suit that is gym worthy.,0
5,Bonito,1
3,"The length of the shoe is true to size, but the area along the top of the toes is super tight, like abnormally tight. For $9.99 i figured i would try and cut off the piping around the toe area with a scissor, and it worked, and the shoes did not fall apart and look totally fine, they just have a curvy look to them now, but they fit comfortably. Had these been more than $10 i would have returned, but for so cheap i took the loss and just altered them to fit with my little ones dress up clothes. Wouldnt recommend for anyone to buy them with the intent of an every day shoe.",0
1,Not as advertised.,0
1,Badly,0
3,"Very soft love the material, just not in love with the the text color! It was supposed to be white and it‚Äôs a yellowish/off white color. Was not how it was pictured.",0
5,I have taken to wearing this every day...they are SO comfortable. The biggest surprise? the support. There is more support than I would have thought from the photos. Will be ordering more soon.,1
4,"Texture of material great, color is what is expected overall a great dress, but runs somewhat on the small size.  Would recommend its purchase to others.",1
2,The fit is a little irregular. Very fitted from the chest and very loose from the hips.,0
5,"Bought this for a 1920‚Äôs Great Gatsby Murder Mystery Party.  It was perfect.  Nice Quality, comfortable & beautiful on!  Great find!",1
5,"Love this dress!  So freaking comfortable and sexy!  I'm 5'1&#34;, 125 pounds and I ordered a small.  A little long when I wear flat sandals but I am pretty short, you can adjust the ruching in the middle to make it a little shorter and its perfect when I wear wedge sandals.  I got it in the royal blue but keep thinking about ordering more colors.  Definitely order this dress if you are thinking about it.",1
5,"fits great, covers the rear..can be worn with long nvy skirts or even with jeans..luv it and luv the reduced price",1
1,So big and awkward looking,0
1,I'm not sure what this is made out of...it turned a greenish color after an hour of wear,0
4,"The quality of the engraved plate is almost second to none but the strap runs VERY small. I'm a skinnier man and the medium failed to fit my wrist by a fairly wide margin. I ordered another in size LARGE and it just barely fits my wrist. I'm also not a fan of the prominent and slightly obnoxious branding. I prefer a more subdued look so the ""ROAD RUNNER"" branding that appears in two separate spots on the band are a bit much.",1
2,After having to have surgery last year because of stepping on something on the beach I needed something to protect my feet. I wore these for 3 days while on vacation and they got worse each day. The sole is not sewn in and moved around constantly which was super annoying in the water. The heel of the sole also started to rip apart. After wearing them for a few hours they rubbed and caused sores on my toes. I was not impressed with these at all.,0
3,It‚Äôs really cute but really large. I wear a size 18 pant and it is super big around the waist and I have to tie it around twice. If you‚Äôre maybe like a size 20-22 then maybe it‚Äôll fit but not anyone smaller than an 18 for sure,0
4,"its cute, thought it was a sweatshirt so was disappointed that it was a long sleeve t-shirt, my bad guess i didn't read the description",1
5,Very nice dress. Lightweight which I thought was great for summer. The top is like a cotton t shirt. I wore a plain necklace  and flip flop one day and a nicer necklace with a small heal summer Sandler another. Looked good with both.,1
5,Great product. Going to manufacture a strap for a leaf blower.,1
5,My girlfriend loves her outfit,1
3,"This belt is good, but very short!",0
1,Looked really dumb in real life.,0
5,Beautiful scarf!,1
5,"Comfy, stretchy and cute.<br />Large, 5‚Äô2, 165lbs",1
1,One of the ugliest dresses I've ever seen. I honestly have no clue why I even ordered it. I guess I thought the trumpet sleeve shape was nice. But it wasn't. Looked like a sack with trumpet sleeves.,0
2,I returned product. Material was flimsy on the top.  No support.,0
5,üòç,1
5,"I've been seeing this belt all over Pinterest, and I was dying to have it. Unfortunately, when I googled it I discovered that it's a $350 Gucci belt, which I was absolutely not prepared to pay for. When searching for similar belts here on Amazon I stumbled across this option for less than a tenth of the price, which made me oh, so happy.<br /><br />Is it authentic? Ehhh, probably not. Yes, it has ""Gucci"" and ""Made in Italy"" embossed on the inside of the belt.  And yes, it seems really well-made (whew!).  The buckle is solid and the stitching is sa-weeeeeeet.<br /><br />But, the box it came in has a ""Made in China"" sticker on it, and I'm inclined to think that if someone got hold of a bunch of $350 Gucci belts, they'd opt to sell them for more than thirty bucks.<br /><br />Personally, I don't need it to be authentic because I want the look more than the brand, so I'm definitely satisfied with my purchase and feel confident recommending this purchase to others.<br /><br />Go forth and purchase with confidence!<br /><br />PS: The GG buckle faces the right way. My photo looks backward because I took it in selfie mode, which automatically creates a mirror image.  The close-up of the buckle is closer to its true color, though I think it's a touch brassier-looking than my phone camera captured.",1
3,The black one is really big & if you use the bracelets around water the color will fade a little,0
5,Just as advertised. Super super cute.,1
4,Husband loves them!  Colors are so vibrant and cool. Packaging was very nice. Great quality. Would purchase again.,1
5,"This earrings were exactly as depicted, and they are so cute!  They arrive in GREAT shape...no bends or tangled tassels.",1
1,This winder was incompatable with my watch and was returned without a hassle.I cannot judge the quality of the winder since I was unable to use it.,0
2,the material on the bottoms is super cheap and the seems fold over. not ver katered to girls with curves. DEFINITLEY SIVE 1 TO 2 SIZES UP IF YOUR GOING TO ORDER!,0
5,Beautiful!!! I got it delivered very fast too.,1
3,"Love it, however it is small, the measurements are correct however one of the photos they have posted with the ‚Äòman‚Äô wearing it must be a child or a very petite man.  This holds my phone and keys, and a small wallet, the pockets are small, so you can‚Äôt really store lots of things as you have to empty it to get anything out of the bottom.",0
1,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered these for my cats. (They keep disappearing) The first time, they were great, thick and no sharp claws. This time I ordered 10 and at least 6 of these I had to try to trim the claws myself. 3 ended up in the garbage. They were SUPER sharp!  Several of the feet are almost bare with no hair. I guess it's a hit and miss.",0
3,"This fabric is indeed stretchy, making it comfortable, on the flip side also making it semi-see-through. Really if i wanted to show the world everything then I would just leave the pants at home. Might not be as big of an issue with the darker colors, but the fact that it‚Äôs so thin makes me doubt they will be of any use whilst hiking.",0
5,A bit smaller than expected,1
3,Was smaller than I expected but it is a pretty piece.,0
5,This is perfect for those in between days.  Super comfortable and lightweight. I love wearing it to play tennis when it‚Äôs a bit cooler.  I only wish it was a little longer.  Runs short on me but I‚Äôm also have a long torso.,1
4,"The color is pretty and it fits pretty well, the pockets do lay a little funny creating bumps in the skirt. I'm happy with the dress overall.",1
5,This is my second order we liked it so much!!,1
5,Keeps hands really warm. I am happy with this purchase.,1
3,"It's so long on my 8 inch wrist that I had to cut the end off to keep it from looking ridiculous. The leather band is super thin, and shows damage very quickly. I'm hoping this will patina over time, but I have my doubts.",0
3,Not pleased ..not like shown .. disappointed,0
5,Is just what you expect from a corset is cheap but it works like a high class brand,1
5,Excellent material fits great,1
4,"Beautiful color. Received lots of compliments when I wore it. Would have rated it 5 stars except that it was very, very wrinkled when it arrived.",1
4,These are very adorable. I had to buy the size down to fit though.,1
5,"I ordered this as a gift for my son in law and he absolutely loves it (hope he‚Äôs not just saying that), but he truly seems very happy about receiving this.",1
5,Many different random charms to choose from at a low price. Ordered these for my friend and she loved them :),1
1,The earrings were beautiful BUT they arrived broken and poor quality. I really wanted these earrings.,0
4,"Too small, bought xxl, but the sleeves are more like M. Other than that it's a super cute blouse.",1
1,Junk quality.,0
5,"I can never wear pretty bracelets cus my wrists are extremely small and this fit perfectly!! It's so beautiful, I'm so in loveüòç  Highly recommend for small wrists",1
1,"üòÇ Not only were they the wrong color. I thought I was ordering a dark wash, but I couldn't even get them up over my butt. I wear a size 6 normally. The tag in them said us size 12... Maybe a kid's 12? Lol so ridiculous. I'm sending them back!",0
2,a couple pairs of them broke when trying to open the clasp to put in my ear. The 2 pair that didn't break are very hard to open and close in your ear.  I would not buy these again,0
5,Perfect dress. Very light and perfect for hot weather. Originally ordered a large but it was tight in the chest so I got an xl and it‚Äôs loose in the chest but it works just fine. Got tons of compliments on it when I wore it to a wedding.,1
2,"I like that it‚Äôs light weight and easy to assemble but seriously, where is the top piece. Wasn‚Äôt in the box at all.",0
2,I was looking for a longer sleepshirt that doesn't ride up. This was a good price but the fabric was way too thin. Especially if you like to be free at night. I did like the scalloped bottom but had to return.,0
5,I really liked this watchband. Unfortunately I dropped my watch and broke it so my friend now has a new watchband. :),1
2,"I tried it on today, the top fits a little bit but everything else doesn't fit.",0
5,I love this dress it is so flattering on,1
4,Very cute shirt but it's more for Fall season. Type thick for this humidity.,1
1,It was a gift so I have no information except it was very pretty and well liked,0
4,"Nice fit, however,  I'm 5'7 And the pants come right at the end of my ankles..they could stand to be a little longer, but still nice.",1
1,Fit is bad. Hurts my ear. Posts are too fat.,0
5,"These bags are a great size, with a vibrant red color. They look just like the picture and are as described. Can‚Äôt say anything about durability yet... but they are perfect for my needs.",1
1,"I was disappointed in these sunglasses because they were not the color I ordered. They aren't orange, they are red.",0
5,"What a deal, these were very high quality and worked wonderfully!",1
3,order size a up,0
3,The fabric is the same cheap fabric as most hoddies. But i still like it. However i ordered a xl and its like the same size as a small.,0
3,No size on package or product. Much smaller than expected. Nice material. Would not buy again,0
5,"As a curvey woman buying lingerie online, or at all can be a challenge. I didn't really expect this set to fit but it was a good deal so I gave it a shot. The panties fit well, and surprisingly the bra works too. I wouldn't wear it every day obviously but for a romantic night it's great. It even offers some support for my heavy chest",1
5,"Cute and buttery soft!  5'9"" 27"" waist, 37"" hips.  Length falls right below my ankle.  Mid waisted.",1
3,Excellent customer service but this bra was not for me ü§îüòïüòü,0
5,I love this pullover!  It‚Äôs very soft and comfy.  I wore it out for a walk the other days and got tons of compliments.  I ordered the blue as well and I don‚Äôt like it as much as the grey.,1
5,It was a gift for an Italian greyhound owner. She loved it!,1
1,"I still don‚Äôt know how they work , waste of money",0
5,I work on a covid floor and this scrub cap is a life saver!,1
1,After washing these it became apparent that they had a big tear that was sewn closed on the logo. These were not new and in good condition.,0
3,"Nothing special, but exactly as pictured.",0
3,"The boots are cute, but they fit right on my feet should have ordered one more size bigger...",0
4,I liked the pattern but needs more stability.,1
2,DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PHOTO. VERY CHEAP FINISH,0
5,Great quality and comfy,1
5,Lovely watch,1
2,"Didn‚Äôt receive the colors pictured at all.  No purple, light blue/white, pink/blue.  Instead black and black/yellow.  Bought these for my daughter so not helpful.  Warm but quality seems so so.",0
3,They run SMALL.  I'm a 7 and a half (38) and they barely fit.,0
1,To small,0
1,I finally decided to wear my new boots and they don‚Äôt fit right. And I missed the return window,0
2,"This is larger than expected for a ""minimalist"" wallet.  Also the materiel that has the RFID protection was more a problem than benefit.",0
5,Super sweet gift. Fits our wrist perfect but someone with bigger wrist may not find it comfortable,1
2,"Very disappointed with these glasses, one of the arms completely fell apart.  Hasn't even been two months.",0
5,I purchased two sizes a 10 and a 12 which came as a XL and a XXL. The XL was a perfect fit. I received so many complements on this dress. It it both professional and sexy.,1
4,Very cute dress!!  The slip is a little bit too long underneath but not so off as to reject it.  Daughter loves it!,1
3,"It was a little hard at 1st, its ok now the other one i bought no propnlem at all, i also like the other one so much better, you get what you pay for, I was cheap ........no more!",0
5,"These fit great and work perfectly for around the house, treadmills and for other activities that you don't want to wear shoes for, but don't want to go bare foot!",1
3,"It fit well, but I didn't like the way it looked overall. I felt very costumey, like Dolly Parton. I tried to tame it with a black cardigan and waist belt, but it just wasn't for me. The sequins made layering awkward and uncomfortable. Maybe if it were sleeveless or the sleeves were non-sequined in a contrasting color or black, that might be better. It was also very heavy and scratchy. I read some reviews saying it wasn't scratchy but I found the interior of the dress under the lining to be very scratchy and uncomfortable in the short time I wore it to try it on. There were also some snags in the lave overlay, and one very scratchy thread sticking out of the sleeve. The fit was god though. For size reference, I followed the item's size chart and got both L and XL to try. I'm a 38D with a 35ish inch waist and 40ish inch hips and a slight pooch. The L fit quite well. The XL was too roomy. Both were a good length on me, at 5'5&#34;, 150lbs. I like the way the skirt fell, and the sleeves were a good length and fit around my thick arms. I personally liked the idea of the sequined dress better than I liked the actual dress, but someone else might like it just fine.",0
5,Its a very comfortable shoe. I love it!,1
5,Nice,1
3,Nice looking piece. It looks good and well made. however this did not last long as it has now fallen apart with the metal part coming off from the leather. I have not been able to fix it. I am not sure i can recommend this product to anyone based on my experience with it.,0
5,"The socks fit as I expected them to, tight and supportive. I‚Äôll go they were a little hard to get on, it was easier than I expected. I am going to order me a second pair.",1
1,"Tengo varios a√±os comprando y nunca hab√≠a comprado un articulo de tan baja calidad, ese articulo no lo recomiendo a nadie",0
5,Love these for exercising!,1
1,What can I say but you get what you pay for. Not at all happy with it. Sitting in my closet unused,0
5,these are a bit tight but soft and comfy,1
5,This dress fit perfectly! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and normally wear a 2x and went with a 2x dress. Received so many compliments. I was able to dance without strings coming loose. The length was a bit long which caused me to step on it but I still loved the dress!,1
3,Way too big and way too long. Even for an x-small.,0
1,Beautiful piece if one of the stones were not missing.  Useless because of missing piece. Seller they send repair stone. They did not.,0
5,Perfect,1
1,The sleeves are to small,0
3,"I am sending this back.  Not as described.  Looks like the other cheap shiny ones.  This one was supposed to be a nicer textured fabric (as posted in the photographs).  However, it's not as photographed.  This is the same old cheap fabric.  It's obviously a reproduction of a nicer (designer) skirt.",0
4,"Comfortable, cute, lot of compliments when I used it to dress as Glinda the Good Witch.",1
1,"Very dissatisfied with the order! On the first use, pin of the watchband lostand watch fell to the ground from my wrist !!!",0
4,"What can I say, these are my second pair of Cooltan shorts and I love them. My first pair were almost speedo-like, so I appreciate that these are shorts are a more &#34;normal&#34; cut so that I can feel comfortable in the pool with, even if family or friends come around (I'm not a speedo kind of guy).<br /><br />I live in Arizona and spend a lot of time in the pool, so they do seem to be a lot more fragile than regular swim shorts when sitting or skimming across pebble tec, so after about two years with the other ones (of the same fabric) they started to get a little worn. To me, it is well worth it to have something that tans-through a bit and dries out super quickly when getting out of the pool. Also, the fabric is so lightweight that with the right water temperature, it feels like you almost not wearing anything, which is comfy:)",1
5,My father uses the kurt as a nightshirt and loves it.  The fabric is soft but substantial and the kurta is very well made.,1
5,Love it! The perfect tote!,1
1,"Basically see through. I asked to send mine back and they offered to send a different size instead, so I said that was fine and never received the new size.",0
5,You will be thrilled with and purchase from this company! The detail and craftsmanship is fabulous! Do you like compliments? Order their jewelry and you will get compliments every time you wear them!üíï,1
2,"Not what I expected. Purchased for my Mom to wear around the house but uncomfortable because it needs constant adjusting. Soft, silk like material rides up, very thin. Cool wash, hang dry. I wouldn‚Äôt dare put it in the dryer.",0
3,Got a medium and I can't imagine that even their small would work out for me. It's too bad because the style and material were great and would have been perfect for backpacking.,0
5,My wife loves them and has been getting compliments already. They seem well made and attractive to me.,1
2,Loved this purse/tote but it began tearing only several (7) weeks after I started using it.,0
3,"The Thor Hammer shown here is a nice piece, if a tad flimsy.  It is very lightweight, hollow, and the strap at the botttom is small and not secured very well; I wouldn't recommend using it for anything.  Still, for the $15 total price tag it's about as much as I would pay for it.  This is the kind of item you'd find hanging on a peg at a seasonal Halloween store.<br /><br />What really sells this is the fact that it's an exact replica right down to the script on one side of the hammer's face; ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, will have the power of Thor.""  That was a nice touch.  Overall, a great costume piece, if not a sturdy toy.",0
5,So soft and comfortable,1
5,Looks cool txs,1
5,Sleeves are just a little puffy,1
5,Beautiful top with the sleeve accents.,1
1,Horrible quality. Broke before I even wore it.,0
5,"This was a perfect witch dress!! I got so many compliments and people saying it looked like it was from a movie!! Material is very nice, not thin and rough like stuff from the Halloween store! Definitely recommend!!!",1
5,Great glasses for night driving..,1
5,Fits perfectly and very well lined. Quality is impeccable! I love it.,1
3,It looks sturdy but doesn't fit with my 38mm buckle. Too wide so doesn't click and also too narrow so my male bucket can't go in.<br />Both are for 38mm strap but doesn't fit to each other. Maybe not universal size.<br /><br />And it even came a day late so I couldn't actually use it too.,0
5,Great goggles. I got these for my son and it fits perfectly on him. It has very strong straps that are adjustable for adults and young children. The suction around the eyes are great to prevent entry of water. We tried it for the first time while at the beach this past weekend and it held up great in the salt water. I have attached pics below.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.,1
1,Don‚Äôt even open so I can‚Äôt even charge my phone I‚Äôm afraid to break the bracelet so I just put it in the drawer I bought it for nothing it‚Äôs not worth it this bracelet it‚Äôs hard to open it don‚Äôt even get no stars,0
3,Purchased the size 11. Fit like a 9. Small and tight.,0
3,Love the color (burgundy) and material. Gave it a three though because  I ordered up a size because I like cuddly bigger sweatshirts and it was not big. The bottom on the sweatshirt barely comes to my belt and I do not wear super low rise pants and do not have an extra long torso. There are also fuzz balls all over my house and I‚Äôve washed it a couple times.,0
5,Keeps my hair at night,1
2,"This rings is cute, but very light weight and feels like it could break.  I would recommend it for a kid, but I may wear it if it goes with a casual outfit sometime.",0
3,Would rate higher if they had different hinges,0
4,"good pair of jeans, fits good and booty looks great! Gave it 4 stars because the label says jeans may bleed during washing which I didn't realize until it delivered but so far it survived one run through washer!",1
5,Love it,1
5,"Love it, cute t-shirt for everyday wear",1
3,Is confortable after break,0
5,Great sports bra for large-chested ladies. It definitely holds me in without be too tight and restrictive. I also appreciate that the padding is sewn into the bra so it won‚Äôt shift around.,1
2,"This backpack looks great. The only reason for the low stars is that the zipper actually breaks way too easy. I bought this for my daughter and saw the zipper reviews prior to buying but figured I would still try it, it being cheap enough. But all the reviews regarding the zipper were completely correct. The back pack itself is durable.",0
4,"This jumpsuit is very pretty. The fabric doesn't provide any stretch. It's a bit long for me as I am petite, so I'll have to hem it up.",1
5,Love it,1
5,Cheap and simple. Doesn't require an advanced degree to operate.  Just what I wanted.,1
5,Love the sparkle,1
3,These masks are ok they just didn‚Äôt work for me.  I am a smaller adult and these were just too big and I couldn‚Äôt get them adjusted to where it wasn‚Äôt pressing up against my mouth.  The material is decent quality but the inside layer that holds the filter in place didn‚Äôt seem to be sewn in just quite right.  The colors are pretty and the designs are cute.  Shipping was on time.,0
4,Good looking shirt just bigger than normal 3x,1
1,Arrive broken ...totally not worth the price I paid. Thank goodness I can repair with a hot glue gun otherwise I would have a very disappointed birthday girl.,0
2,"It was nice quality, but it was really small, even if you use the size chart correctly. Luckily I had no problems sending it back and getting a refund.",0
3,Liked the purse. Found one for a more reasonable price,0
1,It was cheaply mad and itchy.,0
5,Great product for the price.,1
1,poor quality,0
4,"Super cute designs but they break easy. It's expected at the price, however its easy to fix, too.",1
3,Was sad this was way to big. I'm a size 36dd the color and fabric were very nice maybe I will exchange for a smaller size,0
1,Cheap fabric. Runs very small. Not worth the money.,0
5,Too cute!!!!!! Love them,1
5,"Item as described, good value for the price. The chain clasp is tiny.",1
5,Exquisite  bonnet. So dainty and sweet.,1
5,"I love this T-shirt and super fast delivery! It is hilarious and high quality, just what I was hoping for.....Thank you!",1
1,Cheap trash that doesn't fit the MDV106 any more than I fit into Shaq's Sneakers.,0
5,Wore it a ton! Size 12 and it fit great,1
5,"Bought these for a 16 hour flight.  Very comfortable, didn't feel strangulating at all!  Didn't get a blood clot, so I guess they work? ;)",1
5,These are great for so many different looks.  We actually buy these whenever we see them for a great price to donate to the local hospital for cancer patients.,1
1,Had to return due to misprint but it was taken care of by company. Own 2 other dresses from them that are perfect,0
5,Great product for price definitely recommend,1
1,"The drawstring is just a piece sewn on the front‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdraw‚Äù anything. I wanted to wear them to exercise, but they‚Äôd fall off. Also, they feel more like polyester than cotton‚Äî",0
5,I love it,1
5,These are made very well. They come in many sizes and fit as expected. Great for edema .,1
3,"Nice for the price, but bigger than expected",0
5,"Great value...dress fits well, the material is very good for the price. Buy it",1
3,A great play badge for my grandson. But tarnished over time..,0
5,Great gift,1
5,it was a gift and as far as i know it is holding up,1
2,Notice in the Amazon photo that the amethysts are a light lavender? The ones I received today look like onyx. Hold them up to the light and they do not even look deep purple. The workmanship is good quality but I did not want black stones. Will have to return.,0
2,The hat fit well but it sweat stained/ faded out really fast. It was worn daily for less than a month and looks like this now. Hand washed a couple of times but that did not help. It started out looking just like advertised.,0
1,COMPLETE JUNK dont waste your money all the leaves were half coming off when i received it,0
4,"The top looked good but I feel runs somewhat larger. I bought XL, my normal size but had to return it as was too big.",1
5,"These are so comfortable. They‚Äôre high waisted, perfect length, and flattering.",1
3,"I wish I had gone up a size and bought the Large, to give more loose shape.  The color is a bright aqua, not the mint-ish shade pictured.  That, combined with the size being too tight, make this a non-starter in my Spring clothing lineup.",0
1,"I ordered a size up, it was still 2 sizes too small. The material is so thin that even when it's lying flat, you can see straight through it!!!",0
2,"Thought I'd try out VenActive compression socks. They are $20 less expensive than another brand I purchased. I purchased a large pair, as I had the other brand. My calf and ankle are large, and large comes up just below the knee. My foot is a size 15. Thought I'd try to save a few bucks: but, the VenActive socks don't expand enough to fit my foot. I wore them 1 day, and they were uncomfortable. Can't wear them again. Now I know.",0
3,"I ordered the 14 gauge, but the hoop diameter (3/8 in maybe) was too small for my conch. It's pretty; I'm disappointed I can't wear it.",0
5,Would recommend these slacks.  Great for work.,1
5,Just as described,1
1,"I READ ALL THE POOR REVIEWS AND THOUGHT, IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.<br />MINE BROKE AS SOON AS I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PUT ON FOR THE FIRST TIME!<br />A WASTE OF MONEY!<br />Don't second guess yourself, this a waste of money.",0
5,"I used the socks to help me spread my toes, especially when I  wear a shoe with a wide toe box.",1
5,I love these earrings and cant wait for Christmas to come again so I can wear them!,1
3,"Don't use this when there is just a bit of wind.  Not sturdy.  Sorry I bought it, will purchase a canopy instead.",0
3,This dress looked exactly like the pictures and was so cute! The fabric is really thin/somewhat sheer but also very light and flowy. Love this dress and would‚Äôve given 5 stars but the thin fabric ripped when I tried it on for the very first time. Plan on exchanging for a new one.,0
5,High quality and very warm.,1

3,"I bought this bag for a 3 and a half week trip to israel and while i think this bag is good, it did not meet my needs on the weekend. I used it as my weekend luggage when we left our hostel and traveled around the country and it would only hold about 2 days worth of clothes, not including pjs,towels, or things like swim suits and my toiletry bag did not fit inside of it. But i do realize that not everyone will use this bag as i did. it did fit under the plane seat, i had no issues with it in the actual air port. I wish it had more pockets, but other than that if you are simply just using this as a carry on to hold maybe 1-2 days worth of clothes it would be a great backpack. It Just didnt fit my needs.",0
5,Elegant,1
5,it is so cute and it was just what me and my friends wanted but it was to long to come,1
5,"So cute and comfortable. I'm 5'7&#34;, 125lbs, 3 or 26 in most jeans, and a 34B. I ordered a small and it fit beautifully!",1
4,Very sticky. Hard to peel off plastic layer. Stays in place. Doesn‚Äôt give as much push up as I‚Äôd like. I tried adjusting the angle. It does a great job squishing everything together but there‚Äôs no way to stick it to get a good lift. Also the edges are easily seen when wearing a more thin fabric,1
1,Seemed super cute! However quickly tarnished after a day of wearing :(,0
5,its beautiful but i did have to tighten some of the pieces so it would not come apart.,1
1,I bought it for my baby shower for my 3 year old to wear this weekend and this is by far the biggest outfit I‚Äôve seen her wear ! The clothes don‚Äôt even say the size on it and I remember purchasing a 3T,0
5,"Purchased for a easy halloween costume as White Goodman from Dodgeball. I am typically a men's medium or women large so I ordered accordingly. Fit great and even after a cycle though the laundry, no shrinkage.",1
2,Nice quality leather. NOT TOUCHSCREEN GLOVES,0
3,"Bandanas are good, headbands are not! I did not know who they made these headbands for! Maybe big foot? They are humungous!",0
3,They are cute,0
1,Too small,0
3,"I don't know whose ears are this long but damn. That's a long bar for an industrial. Learn from my mistake- measure your ear before ordering. This is decent for when it's swollen (if you swell up A LOT) but it hinders the healing process because it's easier to bump it. Also if you have hair, be careful because it will get hair tangled around it.",0
5,"I love this outfit it is comfortable fits exact colorful I just love it.  I am going to buy another one.  I would recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />I cannot take all the time to add links & addresses, Ive been ill & just do not have the time nor energy",1
5,They are perfect sold as a set but they are individually wrapped great seller thank you,1
1,It was lopsided and it was like they didn't know how the garment was supposed to look. The absolute worst. Came from Asia so you can't send it back,0
5,i liked it. cloth material is very nice and it fits good..,1
1,Poor quality and ran about two sizes small had to send it back.,0
3,A little snug,0
5,"I love the soft material and how it hangs and I love the design on the top, I have the white one and the navy one, I plan on buying the black, pink, and the blue one, next month.",1
3,"Didn't like the color,  not as on the picture.  Color looked like the dress was washed few times!",0
5,"Very warm and soft, super good quality. And definitely worth the price.",1
5,I was a little skeptical about this watch because it was a from a brand that was not familiar to me but after reading about it and checking out the reviews from other places other than Amazon I decided to get one and I was not disappointed. It‚Äôs very comfortable to wear and looks great. It‚Äôs automatic movement is accurate to about 5 seconds per day it has a screw down crown and has hacking movement.  It‚Äôs a fairly large size which works great for me but might not for people with a smaller wrist.,1
1,"Too small, had to return.",0
3,The elastic waistband on the pants it‚Äôs snug in comparison to the rest of the pant. Not as comfy as I would have expected.,0
5,Looks really good and seems like a sturdy material.,1
1,"These were fine on the plane, but a day or so later, I developed an extremely itchy rash on both legs where the top band of the socks were, and the rash took days to go away. I do not have a latex allergy, and have never had an allergic reaction to any elastic in clothing before. Not sure what happened.",0
1,The fabric was very poor quality.  And the size was much bigger than expected.  The product was not represented at all accordingly.<br /><br />I returned it same day.,0
5,"Beautiful, colorful and very artsy bracket!  I love the combination of beads and colors!  It is the perfect gift for my 20 year old daughter.  It has an eastern flair to it.  Very hip these days, like the wrap around brackets but this has a little more originality to it. it looks great with a tee and a pair of jeans or a nice dress.  I love that it is so versatile.  It fits perfectly and it is really great quality.  Great bracelet, great gift!<br /><br />I was given a disc. for my honest review",1
2,"This 'dress' was too short for me at 5'8, and the fit in the back was pretty awkward so I returned it.",0
1,Didnt last.. one of the metal pieces at one end that slides to connect band to the watch came off.,0
5,Fantastic buy!,1
5,"I was worried when I read other reviews about holes. They've been ok so far, but I also have size 6&1/2 to 7 feet.",1
5,Very nice gift for the price,1
4,The dress is nice quality and comfortable however I would recommended sizing down. I‚Äôm normally a small and this was quite big on me especially in the chest. Maybe if you have a large chest you could stay true to size. Also I‚Äôm pretty tall at 5‚Äô8‚Äù and the dress was not too short on me which is so hard to find! It hit a few inches above my knee.,1
2,Waist fit as expected. Length is VERY short. My kids don't like that they are not longer as their legs still rub against the seat of their bike while riding. Returning for a longer pair of bike shorts.,0
5,"This ring...the balance between the prism of the stone and the dantiness of the slim rose gold band is exquisite.  It's sized properly, and is just an unexpectedly gorgeous surprise.  I bought it as a gift, and never took it off!",1
4,IT IS CUTE,1
4,Love this dress!  Fits perfectly and very classy. The only thing that could be a problem is that the material is thinner than I thought so might have to wear spanks. I do love that the design of the dress draws yours eyes away from the tummy and creates a flattering curvy figure.,1
1,Horrible the cap wasn't as described,0
3,"The two stones match (which is not always guaranteed with inexpensive mail-order jewelry), but the size is tiny. They barely qualify as 3mm if you measure widest point, including the setting. Still, a good deal for the price.",0
3,"Really cute shirt but small, I would size up",0
5,"Love this label.<br />Washes, lasts forever, cool in summer and great for travel.",1
5,"Cute T-shirt!  I received many compliments when I wore it.  I'm between a small and medium and purchased the medium for extra room.  It fit the way I wanted, not to fitted, but not too baggy!",1
5,So cute and a great price,1
5,I love it! Better than expected!,1
1,Very thin and def not OVERSIZED!  The K and E are half printed on the inside of the neck of the shirt. You can see it from the back but not the front. Looks cheap.,0
1,"These did not fit, however<br /><br />WSSROGY 20 Pack 25mm x 50mm Large Rectangle Pendant Trays Pendant Blanks Cameo Bezel Settings for Photo Charm, Cabochon and DIY Jewelry Making(Antique Bronze) did.",0
5,"Well done slippers that everyone Loves! They are really toasty and comfy but be advised they are somewhat slippery. My Lady ate it running down the stairs as she lost her footing due to the non-grip at the bottom of these slippers. I would absolutely buy them again, just a warning to move safely with them on! lol",1
5,"This is an EXCELLENT buy! The colors are vivid, fabric is stretchy and wrinkle free. Noticed the inside seams are well sewn with no extra threads to be seen. Am 5' 4&#34; weigh 150 and have broad shoulders. The drape of the fabric is a great tummy hider...love that!  At age 72 I felt great wearing it to my Tuesday Girls Out and was asked to stand up so it could be seen by all!",1
3,It took several months to get here. The material is very strange kind of like kids fire resistant pajamas. They are strangely soft though and the fit is cute. I wouldn‚Äôt order this again but I will end up wearing it around the house.,0
5,"Received this for mothers day with another set of carabiners.  It's good quality and very on trend.  I wore it with a v-neck summer tee and it was the perfect compliment to finish off the look I was going for.  If you want an original piece - that is a conversation starter, purchase from this new line of jewelry.",1
3,Runs small,0
5,I love it!!!  Not small at all.,1
5,Super cute,1
2,"super cheap looking/feeling, which probably should have been expected for the price :|",0
5,"This nightgown fits me like a big soft comfortable tent. It's very roomy and soft. and I enjoy sleeping in it. The color is as pictured, I bought the purple. I would buy it in other colors.",1
1,"Se extravi√≥ y no consigo rastrearlo, al principio en mi lista de pedidos aparec√≠a la informaci√≥n de que aparentemente estaba extraviado. Cu√°l es la onda? Que irresponsables",0
5,Love this ankle bracelet.  Great price.,1
2,Myself.,0
4,It did not fit properly for my head. I gave it away as a gift and the woman loves this hat.,1
2,Cant wear anything but tank top underneath or every wrinkle will show.  Extremely stretchy and hard to hold it's shape.,0
5,Perfect fit.,1
1,These just aren‚Äôt a good fit. The band wobbles around inside the groove where it connects to the watch.,0
3,"2 rips in crotch area after 1/2 hr of wearing. It's a quick fix, but that's not the point. Otherwise, love them!",0
4,Very good beanie. The gray part underneath kind of comes out when you put it on but all in all it does what it's supposed to do and keeps your head warm. Fit is a little tight but good nonetheless.,1
3,I didn‚Äôt like it,0
4,It's ok. Probably could find if in the store. Thin and cheap made. But it will work,1
2,Very stretchy material used more so for a night gown not causal out side Wear,0
3,Not the greatest ankle bracelets. Some fell apart right away and some held up for a month or so. But you can‚Äôt complain about the price and the large assortment.,0
1,This hurt my daughters ears and easilt broke.  Waste of money,0
1,There are holes in both gloves.  I'm very disappointed.  Please expedite the label for return.  My forearms are very sensitive to sunlight and I need soft gloves to cover them. Thank you,0
3,Bonito?pero f√°cil de romper el fierro que entra en el o√≠do,0
4,"I love this little dress. It's well made, light weight, cool, and very comfortable. I will be ordering others. Only reason it is not a 5 star, is the chemical smell. First washing it did not come out. We shall see about subsequent ones. (Wear a US xl and ordered 5xl. Fits perfectly)",1
5,It‚Äôs great!,1
5,Great robe. Well made and very comfortable.,1
1,I have a handmade leather belt and this clip is too thin to be functional. Works ok ion thinner nylon belts.,0
5,Comfortable and stylish. I wear them everyday.,1
3,Said true to size and I got large. Too small. They look very nice though. Nice color and material.,0
5,"Fantastic quality, well packaged and very easy to size. The mechanical latch system is super easy to use and gives the belt a unique holeless look.",1
1,Did not flow like in image,0
4,"Classic cheap casio watch. Made in Thailand, not China.",1
3,I was complimented for this top...its cutest of my all Allegra buy...Its not white but beige color..I recommend this top,0
3,Good watch for the price.,0
5,love this shirt. wanted a mickey themed shirt but nothing too &#34;cutesy&#34; for my 7 year old. this was perfect,1
2,"Ehh a little on the cheap side I thought they would be more structured and conforming.  I use they<br /> Under my work shirt (I work in a resturant) to give me a second layer.  They are ok for the job I am using them for, just not totally what I expected.",0
1,"I did not dislike the product as much as the false ad.  I got two packs of 10 each masks, 20 in total and there were 10 in each pack.  They were not individually wrapped as the captioned stated.  I am now waiting for an additional order, so time will tell.",0
3,Aviator sunglasses.  The glasses have a gold frame and a black green colored lens.  I  gave 3 stars bc the arms are not coated where they go over your ears so they are not as comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The glasses are light weight and fit well. They come with a white pleather carrying case.  Decent quality aviator sunglasses.,0
2,Really just junk...no real metal just very junky plastic painted to look like metal :(,0
5,"These are large enough that they are nearly hoop earrings, but they are not too overbearing (I can't wear big hoops). Bought these for my friend and she loves them, they are quality and they just look good.",1
4,A simple stain wouldn't come out.,1
5,It's a nice piece of glasses for cheap price. My kids love it. The pouch in the picture does not include with the items. It misleads customers.,1
5,Love these leggings. This is my second order and I like these even more than my last order! I am 5'8&#34; 220 lbs and wear about a size 16-18. They fit perfect. I will totally be buying more!,1
2,The material was of poor quality... More like night  wear ...,0
5,Loved it,1
2,After washing these just a few times the stretchy part has become too stretched it seems and they look funny now. Not a good buy at all.,0
5,My granddaughter loved it.,1
5,Great product work wonderfully looks beautiful,1
3,"I really, really wanted to like these bras.  I ordered several.  And at first, I really loved them.  Then after moving around, bending, doing normal life things - the wires on the sides started curling in and digging in to my skin.  They would not stop curling in even after adjusting them and sitting still for a bit.  They are pretty and a reasonable price, but the wire stays on the side are painful and make these a no-go, unfortunately.",0
3,I returned this product as it was too much work to put them on my kids feet. I was spoiled by old navy ones that used Velcro so my kids could get them on and off on their own.,0
5,"Beautiful, delicate, reasonably priced and arrived quickly. I'm wearing it nowüòä",1
4,"good material, but too large for the size, Also, the color is too dark not as described",1
3,"I do like the pearl set, looks nice and is a perfect size, however, after only 1 month, 2 of the 6 necklaces that I ordered have broke and it is too late for me to do an exchange or return through Amazon.",0
5,"We do a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day 10k every year, and it‚Äôs always cold at the start line before we start moving. This jacket was perfect for layering to help stay warm. I am 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and 34DD, about 150 pounds.",1
1,Have to go return these as they came not not stitched to the sole! What a hassle!!!!,0
4,creepy and funny,1
2,"Item didn‚Äôt even work. Replaced batteries thinking they just weren‚Äôt any good, item still doesn‚Äôt work. Little disappointing.",0
5,Fit great,1
4,"I have been looking for a thin silver belt and a thin gold bet for sometime. I have some link and chain belts that I like a lot but I wanted something a little  more decorative looking for some of my prettier/dressier clothes.  These totally fit the bill.  That they stretch is a plus since I'm dieting so they'll continue to fit as I lose weight.  I also like the neat, tidy appearance of them. Unlike my chain belts there are no extra loops hanging down.  The leaf and rosette buckles are very pretty and these belts really define the waist.  The gold rosette belt has a slight pink/gold cast but its still attractive.  These 4 belts for $14 is a good value to me.  My mom is already looking to borrow them.",1
1,"Do not tumble dry this item, regardless of what the tag reads. It will ruin your shirt and will be much too small for the original person to wear. It lost TWO sizes.",0
4,"They are nice. A tad small for my head & I wish the straps were a bit wider, but they arrived as advertised & the quality is good. I‚Äôd wear these more as a fashion statement than for waving.",1
4,Great Product. I thought it wasn‚Äôt going to fit when putting it on. Once it‚Äôs on it actually feels comfortable.,1
5,"I bought these for a costume but they are very high quality, quite heavy and I will most likely use them again for ""regular days"".",1
5,Fabric was a little iffy.  But honestly I have never gotten so many compliments on a dress.  I was greeting at my church and people I didn‚Äôt even know would say ‚Äúwow‚Äù.  I was almost feeling like I was being punked.  Would buy again!,1
2,Cheap material,0
5,Very happy with purchase pice and delighted with packaging,1
3,"A bit too dark, hard to tell its navy blue, look almost black",0
1,Nothing like the picture and is listed as free returns and is not I had to pay 15 dollars to send it back,0
3,Me agrado un poco,0
1,Smaller size than as described. i send an email to the seller but he never answered at all and I never wear it.,0
2,I dont know what i was expecting but it looked a lot smaller and i ordered a large....didnt close over the girls......#sad,0
1,really did not like these glasses. the lenses are movable showing that they are pretty cheap. And it wasn't matte which is what i had been wanting but it was a cheap plastic something that you would find at a dollar store.,0
5,I'm not use to intricately designs clothing but this wasn't hard to figure out and fit awesome!! Very pleased!!,1
1,Even though I bought the size I normally buy it is just really large. I can't wear it.,0
4,They're good for what I need them for.,1
3,Too small to fit this should have elastics style material so that it can fit multiple specs.. had to return,0
3,"Products warm, must watch tho. Wore them two weeks and bottom was separating from material.",0
5,Granddaughter loved her slippers..seem to be sturdy and comfy!,1
4,Was way to small for what I needed. My fault for not understanding the sizing listed. I no longer have it so I cannot add a picture. Just make sure you know what size of ring you actually need.,1
4,"I wear a small and I got a medium because of the reviews. The medium fit well, like a small in my opinion. I thought the compression was pretty good.They aren't buttery fabric, but I love the color. Great buy for $15!!!",1
5,Love this bracelet! Easy to put on and stays on straight!,1
5,"Good price, quality product, good compression.  Better product than what I found at sporting good stores.",1
4,"I wanted to like this shirt. I've been searching for the perfect red shirt to go with a pair of LLR leggings that I can't seem to match, and the color was right. The fit was fine, and the fabric was fine. But it had this weird line in the front near the neck that just looked strange. it may have been just an indentation from the back hem, and I might very well come out with washing, but it looks like it's actually dyed into the fabric. the line made the whole shirt look weird when I put it on. I'm not really sure how I feel about it now.",1
1,"Don‚Äôt waste your money, I got so frustrated I just threw it in the trash.",0
3,After one washing the seams are coming out.,0
1,Fell off first day of wearing it without my knowledge and now I don't have a fitbit.,0
3,Cute dress,0
3,"I'd like to contact the seller, but not seeing that option. I only recieved 4 face masks, not 5.",0
5,"Medium fit as expected. 5'6&#34;, 136lbs, 35.5&#34; bust, 30&#34; waist.  Not too tight, but just right.",1
5,"Very happy with this hat, perfect for when i do deliveries for Uber Eats!",1
5,absolutely stunning,1
5,Looks just like the pics. No complaints. Easy to adjust and to put on and off. Screen works with it as well. I recommend it.,1
5,Great product,1
1,"I ordered this from the Arctic Cool website directly.  I was hoping it would be a loose fitting comfortable gaiter that I can use as a face covering while away from home.  This is NOT a comfortable gaiter at all.  I have a very average size neck for a man, but the gaiters I received (gray & blue) were very tight fitting around my neck.  I was hoping the fit would be loose at the bottom of the gaiter to allow for air flow from underneath.  The pictures here on Amazon, and on the company's website make it appear to be loose, but it has elastic at both the top and bottom of the gaiter, so it's tight around the neck.  I had to send both back.  If you want something that is loose, roomy, or allows for ventilation, this is NOT the gaiter for you.  Also, the products are made in China, if you care about such things...",0
5,"I purchased this cat tail for my niece‚Äôs birthday. She loves it! She had use a belt, string or anything she could find to make a ‚Äútail.‚Äù This came in handy  It‚Äôs thickness and length are great. It has loops which makes it easy to attach to a belt, that is a plus because she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about it coming off. I highly recommend this product!",1
5,"Very pretty, bought the wrong size",1
5,Looks good,1
2,Earring we‚Äôre as they appeared on Amazon. I was not able to wean in tragus area because neae the earing piece is bulky and it prevents the earing to go all the way through.,0
5,Talla mediana y me quedo perfecta el mejor set de gimnasio y el color est√° precioso,1
5,"Love, love, love all of these leggings.  Well worth the purchase!  They're comfy and they feel and look awesome!",1
4,Beautiful but the large fit like a small,1
2,"I have a very wide head.  The top outside corner of the lens digs into my head.  For reference, I wear 54x18 eye glasses.",0
1,"My impression of the item that it was a ""one size fits all"". I expected the waist ""tie"" would allow one to adjust the tightness on an individual. I wear XL and could not even begin to pull the skirt on, let alone adjust it. So I will be giving it away and will not order from this vendor in future.",0
5,I don't understand why they don't produce enough in the small. Jockey seems to always be out of them.,1
5,I love these sunglasses! I have a huge collection of them but I was missing a pair of plain black ones and these are perfect!,1
1,Its plastic not real,0
5,i wear it all the time...great quality and great support,1
1,"I purchased this dress with the understanding that it was FREE refunds if needed to return‚Äî dress was poor quality, not as pictures showed and they refunded less than half of the purchase price, I was charged a restocking fee of 60%. Would NOT recommend purchasing from this company!",0
5,Absolutely gorgeous necklace! I wore it for my wedding and it really made my outfit!,1
2,The tint on the goggles creates a halo effect when looking at light.,0
2,We spray painted them in hopes of looking better,0
5,"Love the print, feel and flow of this dress. It fits true to size and would buy again",1
5,Bought it as a gift for my mother. First time buying jewelry. She was very pleased and happy with it.<br /><br />The box is nice and the size of the item is nice; large enough to be noticed but small enough to be subtle.,1
1,"I like that the shirt fits perfectly for my size.  I didn't like that The secondary color is not as the image describes.  Instead of it being grey and black, it was gray and white.  Very dissatisfied with the product!!!",0
5,"Let me start by saying that I received this product at a discount. I want to be upfront with that, and add that I only accept products that I think I‚Äôll like and have no problem with giving a negative review if the product warrants it. If the product fails to meet expectations later, or holds up even better than I‚Äôd hoped, I‚Äôll update.<br /><br />I purchased this top for my lovely wife, and she loves it. She is headed out on a trip tonight, and was in the middle of packing when we got the package. She tried it on, gushed over it, and said &#34;This is coming with me.&#34; Coming from her, it really doesn't get much better than that!<br /><br />The material is light, soft, and flowing; but it isn't so light that it is see through. She tells me that it was a very comfortable fit, and very comfortable fabric. She loves the lacy top too which shocked me because she doesn't usually go for that kind of thing. We'll see how it holds up over time, but the seams look good, and while the fabric isn't anything like denim, I expect it to hold up fairly well under regular usage. You know, unless it snags on something, but that is just the risk you ladies take to look and feel good.<br /><br />So all in all the shirt feels good to her and it makes her feel good. I can't ask for more or give it higher praise, except to say that I think she looks great in it too.",1
5,Love the fit and POCKETS!!!,1
2,Sizes are not made for adult makes over 5‚Äô tall or over 100 pounds. Ordered the largest size they had and still not big enough. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 180 pounds,0
5,"These are sort of like the spandex version of swim trunks I see on my father in photos from the 1960s.  They're about as streamline as a speedo, but  with a more conservative look (I've never been entirely comfortable going out on the deck in my panties).  I have a 33&#34; waist and fairly muscular thighs and glutes, and the small/medium fits great (snug, but not tight).  They've been very comfortable during my workouts.  Material is thick, and they seem well made.  They're very similar to very short cycling pants without the crotch pad.",1
5,"This is a very cute shoe!! I love the style, it's comfortable, and it's true to size.",1
5,"I was very happy,  and my cousin loved it.",1
1,TOOK FOREVER TO GET IT... AND PRODUCT ARRIVED WITH THE GLASS FACE BROKEN.. BUT NOT WORTH RETURNING WOULD ONLY GET A WHOLE .50 BACK.,0
5,"Are of nice quality metal, better than I expected. I wear them a lot. Came on time.",1
1,The front and back would not stay together!,0
4,Outfit is good for shopping jogging and relaxing,1
5,Great shoes super durable,1
1,The metal becomes deformed,0
3,"First the pros: Nice fabric. Cute print. Quality looking. Long for an almost 6' woman. Cute, flattering elastic back.<br />Now the cons: actually too long, at my usual size (Large, if no sz 10 for bottoms/dresses and 12 for tops) for my tall body, although I do have a short waist . Very strangely loose in front lower abdomen & groin area, so it makes me look ""thick"" in the waist. Bodice is a bit low cut and you can't pin it because there is a wide gap area, above the top button.<br />  Needed to try the medium ASAP for my anniversary picnic, so I ordered that right away (strange thing there with the medium continually coming up in my cart as an XS, even with Amazon customer service on the phone helping me...tho the replacement that came was a medium!) The medium fit better, but in the end I did not keep because of all that extra fabric in front groin!( I put pictures of the medium under that review)",0
3,Pretty color. Just too big. I wear small and ordered size small. The dress looked almost matronly. May try it with a different belt to see if that helps.,0
2,Not great.,0
1,It's looks cheaply made ! Not stitched like j thought it would be,0
5,Loved it! Perfect sizes.,1
5,"I love jewelry that is pretty without being expensive or gaudy.  This is a pretty piece that will go with just about anything from casual to dressy.  It arrived in a teal color box which is nice for gift giving.  The piece itself is actually a pretty substantial size without being too big.  It is not a tiny little piece.  The whole piece is silver plated, so it has a nice silver look and shine to it.  It has a nice weight to it without being too heavy.  It is well made and should be durable for years to come.  The heart and butterfly design are pretty and simple.<br />This is nice enough to give as a gift.  Though size wise this would probably be best for a tween or above.  I would opt for something smaller for younger children.<br /><br />I received this item at a free or reduced rate in exchange for my honest an unbiased review.",1
5,Looks cool,1
1,Muy diferente que la foto. Corre muy peque√±o y la tela es mala,0
4,It‚Äôs cute but it was tighter than expected returned it and will buy a size up,1
4,"I got these for a photo session I am preparing for, and these are brilliant. Wow. They are so lovely that they could be called works of art. Also, these are surprisingly well-made and sturdy-not flimsy and cheap like I worried about. Very nice. I am very pleased with these, and now I want to go to a party and wear one!",1
5,That it is very secure.,1
2,"I'm very dissapointed. Shoes look and feel very solid and nicely finished. Fit as expected. I bought size 8 for my son at the beginning of October but we leave in Nashville TN so it was too hot to wear them for a long time. At the beginning of November, after just a month and more importantly after just a first use the shoes are already worn up! I understand that 2 year old is running like a crazy but how those shoes supposed to survive the entire season (even very short)? The rubber on the bottom just got torn off which suggests that the quality (and density) was very poor. You can't tell this when you take the shoes out of the box. Layers disattached and the cover has scratches. Despite the company has many good looking shoes I will not order from this Seller anymore. Thankfully Amazon was supportive to take my return after a month passed, otherwise I would waste a lot of money for trash! I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. I gave two stars because they really look good...",0
1,Bad quality. The post bends. Very cheap,0
2,The brown color is not as dark as the photo,0
5,Beautiful scarf,1
3,Stretchy,0
5,This shirt is very nice.  The fabric is a substantial cotton and the graphics on the shirt are clear.  It looks just like Tim Duncan.  You can really tell when it's authentic apparel.  Perfect gift for my husband's birthday!,1
3,The leaf is very oversized. Super big on a small wrist. More bothersome than I like wore it once and it was annoying to always move it to feel comfortable,0
3,Too small.. i just gave it to my 4 years old daughter..,0
5,work perfectly and fits well,1
5,Very cool!,1
5,"This dress is so pretty. The organic cotton material is thick and soft. And the details on the dress are just lovely. It has ruffles and a layered hem.<br /><br />I got a size 5 for my chubby granddaughter. She is short, so it works for her, but this dress does seem a little short for a child who would normally wear a size 5 - although the sleeves are nice and long.<br /><br />Very nice quality. So pleased.",1
5,Very well made!,1
5,A very good sun glasses...Comfortable and easy to carry i love it.,1
5,beautiful. very sparkly. love them,1
4,I gave 4 stars.  5 stars for quality-very soft and fun details (the hood has a mask built in!) 3 stars because it does run small. I have a small 5 year old boy. I bought a 6 and wish I had gotten a 7.,1
1,"Just a flimsy, low quality shirt with a hood and sleeves sewn on. Fits way too dmall for an XL, too",0
2,"Too large for the size so I wasn't able to wear it. I would have ordered small rather than medium. I ordered medium base on the description that it was a mini dress and it wasn't. I just checked on the item and it says that ""their clothing sizing has been updated"". So glad they finally updated it so people won't order the wrong size.",0
5,"Loved it! True to size, color. Did not shrink or fade and has been washed numerous times.",1
5,Love how thin it is and it fits perfectly!,1
2,broke very fast,0
1,Why in searches for US size 16 does this swimsuit come up at all?  The largest size offered XXL says it fits a US 8-10.  Every search for a size 16 suit is cluttered with cheap chines suits for very small sizes.,0
5,This has was totally fun to wear for the Kentucky Derby banquet that I attended.  It gave me the sassy attitude that I was looking for.,1
5,Make sure you get a size smaller. Other than that its sexy,1
5,Good transaction and great product,1
5,Great but!,1
1,Bad choice of of colour on shoes.,0
2,Sizing is accurate but they are super super see through. I have yet to wear these out of my house because they show everything.,0
2,"I needed a stretch belt for some dresses and ordered 3 colors of this belt.  It is very cheap looking.  And runs very small.<br />Debated about keeping them because they didn't cost much, but back they went.  The Ol' get what you pay for.<br />I do not recommend.",0
1,This shirt stinks so bad! There is a chemical smell that won't come off. I returned it!,0
4,"Great everyday tees! Good materiel, although they did shrink a bit in the wash so we hang dry now.",1
3,Awesome! Would buy again! Does what it says!,0
5,"Received this bracelet today, love it!!!  I love the fact it came in different sizes,  I ordered a small and it is perfect.<br />Another great plus is  that it is made in the US, we make the best products!",1
1,Hard to use,0
4,"I bought this based on the video from a verified purchase, and it was what I expected. The sleeves are a little short, however; if they went down to my hand I would've given this 5 stars. I'm a fan of the tie around the waist, but you can't adjust the length of it. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.",1
2,"Not long sleeve more like a quarter sleeve, looks like a cap and gown cape. Not worth it.",0
1,Very cheap material . Feels itchy . Not made well at all . Don‚Äôt waste your money,0
3,The Costume was really great and put together really well however the size came too big for my daughter.  So the run on joke now is that she will have too grow into it.,0
5,Very well made and very low price for such high quality! Shipped fast too!,1
2,They say it's a large face watch but they lied it just a typical watch you can find at a dollar store,0
1,I ordered my daughter's size (4) and she couldn't fit her foot in the shoe at all.,0
1,I teach yoga for a living and I bought these for the winter months bc the floors get cold.  They were so thin and run small!!! I washed them and they shrunk so badly they couldnt fit a toddler. lol I'd keep looking for another pair.  Not sure if I can return the other pair bc I worn one.  I need to look inot this,0
5,Love this wallet. I have this one and the larger one. It holds everything.  I gave these out as X-mad gifts.,1
4,"Lense is a little darker than what I wanted, but very good.",1
2,"Quality was good, fit fine, but slit was too high.  Halfway up my panty line.",0
2,This is very low quality fabric/ it is low grade polyester that scratches like crazy/ even after washing.,0
5,Favorite hat,1
5,Excelente calidad 1A,1
1,I was shipped a used product. Pet hairs all over the fabric. The internal label even had fading from multiple washes.,0
1,Too small and tight ‚òπÔ∏è,0
2,"Very pretty, but runs large, especially in the bust.",0
5,She will love it,1
1,First off I was under the impression this was a casual jumper. It is two separate pieces. The fit was good trying it on but I found a hole in the top. Returned!,0
1,"I've been wearing it for a a few hours and it already has a hole in it (where the seam meets the rest of the fabric. I knew it wasn't going to be high quality at this price, but that's just ridiculous.",0
5,Very beautiful. Advertise the way it actually looks,1
1,"I wear size XL. So knowing how overseas sizing is so much smaller than USA sizing, I ordered this ZICUE women's short sleeve V-neck dress in size XXL. I received it....after a period of time....this dress is a size Medium by USA sizing standards!!!  I ordered another dress from a different maker (different name anyway) in a size XXXL. And it certainly is the correct size. Therefore, I cannot wear either dress!!! I won't be ordering any more clothes over the internet!! Lesson learned.",0
4,Gave a neat and polished appearance.,1
5,Yes very pretty,1
4,"They are very cute with lace, for someone small.  When it says this size fits all, that is not true.",1
5,These headbands fit my 10 year old's head perfect.  Not tight. Not itchy.,1
5,"Muy bonitos,  puedo dormir con ellos",1
2,not real happy,0
1,There is no way that the size I ordered is a extra small. The reason I haven't sent it back yet is I'm supper busy. Very disappointed ...,0
1,a tee shirt is thicker than this product. not what i was expecting,0
1,I like these but there‚Äôs so much extra fabric around the crotch area so they aren‚Äôt flattering at all.,0
5,"I don't normally review products, even though I am a frequent Amazon shopper and prime member. This bag is great! In my opinion, the perfect size. Very functional with both the shoulder strap and the handles. Lots of pockets and zippered compartments inside and out. So far very durable and well-made, surprisingly so for the cost. I am starting my own business as a doula and plan to use this bag as the one I keep my personal items, paperwork, and reference materials in when I go to births in the hospital. Highly recommend!",1
1,Completely see through and when worn the pineapples don't keep their vibrant colors sharp shape.,0
4,"This charm was exactly the type and size I wanted, & the price was right!",1
5,Nice addition to any casual outfit - love that you can wear it grey or white showing.,1
2,"Sorry, get a bad review from me.  Backs so small I couldn't get them on.  Your silicone didn't help me at all.  Gave up and finally gave them to my granddaughter.  Her fingers work better than mine.",0
5,Timely delivery and exactly what we wanted. Good quality too,1
3,Very cute shoes my daughter loves them but a lot of minor details that do bother me and are quite noticeable  I tried removing the pen markings but couldn't,0
1,The fit was so bad. It fit like a trash bag. The waist was cut way too low and the small size still fit huge.,0
5,"I love this item and would buy again. Fabric is high quality, a little heavier than I expected. Nice flattering fit.",1
5,"I don't need a prescription glass, but my eye doctor recommended some +1.00 to ease my eye strain working with computers all day (and quilting all night). These glasses have anti glare and they are a nice mellow color. They seem durable, but I always leave them in the case when not in use. (I take pretty good care of them). I've been using them off and on at my office, and I do seem to experience less headaches. It's probably hard to prove if they really work for me, but I feel like they help.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good value to try since it includes the case, the cleaning cloth, and some sweet computer hacker styling (as opposed to nerdy librarian styling).",1
5,Bought this for my daughter as she is scared of loud sounds and she loves it. Whenever she puts it on she feels secured and fearless. It fits comfortably on her and does not leave any red marks on the side of her head/ear area after wearing. And I love how they come with a cute carry pouch that she can wear on her back like a backpack whenever she is not using it. Would definitely purchase again. I highly recommend it.,1
4,Super warm and comfy!,1
5,Good product,1
3,These were good for earrings,0
5,I ordered this ring for my grand daughter and she loves it. It is a dainty ring for a little girl. I'm sure she will love it.,1
5,Very warm,1
3,its ok,0
5,Awesome,1
4,"Got these for my husband for Christmas he absolutely love them! They are fun, colorful and he  said They are comfortable and he really like the height of them. So they‚Äôre a good buy. I‚Äôd recommend.",1
4,"It good price, the color good too.",1
5,Love this.... I love anchor.,1
5,"This is a well made, quality leather travel bag. The size is perfect for a carry on and holds a good amount of clothing.",1
1,You literally can only get a few good uses out of this even after cleaning it as instructed.  Not really worth it to be honest.  Just FREE THE NIPPLE!,0
5,"Cute hat just what I wanted, sadly someone stole it from me at a party so I will have to order it again! :( pictures on my instagram @sierrathegoat",1
3,A little large for my taste,0
5,Loved that they fit just right my kid is always looking to see if they've been washed so he can put them on every night.,1
3,a wee bit big but wearing it for laps in a public pool working just sfine its exercise not looking to make a fashion statement,0
2,Too heavy and too stiff.,0
5,"LOVE these warm/cold insulated bags!  I use them for my Shipt shopping and they are so handy, easy to use, portable, and lightweight.  I like that these came in a pair, I keep the hot items in one while shopping snd the colds and frozens in the other.  And the green one is the Shipt logo color green!",1
3,"Foam mask, it doesn‚Äôt stay together well",0
5,did not work well,1
5,"Seems to hold op to an active 15 year old boy who play football, has not broken.  Nicely done.",1
5,love them,1
5,It's a beautiful dress.thankyou,1
1,"What I ordered looks nothing like this images, and the sizing chart does not reflect what I received either. Probably one of the worse purchases.",0
5,Socks come in three shades which is desirable. There is a silicone strip at the heel so there is no slipping out of these socks.,1
4,"Love 90 degree leggings. They are so comfortable and soft. They tend to run a tad on the smaller size but I don't mind. I purchased a Large because after I wear them a few times they tend to loosen up comma I did not want my leggings to be too loose. The only issue that I have is the threads tend to come undone around the ankle, I have another pair of the black leggings in large, but they are the midcalf length and the stitching around the calf is coming unthreaded. Not the end of the world thats what sewing machines are for but it would be nice if the stitching was more durable. Thats why I gave them 4 stars. Love these leggings!!",1
5,My daughter loved them! They fit perfect,1
1,"I was really looking forward to these bracelets because they were for a specific outfit. They shipped & arrived quickly. However, one of the wooden bangles was broken and one of the metal bangles was not soldered correctly, making it look like it was broken.  I am uncertain if the wooden bangle was broken in transit or if it was broken prior to shipping. Maybe if it had shipped in a box vice a padded envelope, I wouldn't have to return it.  I was also very unhappy to find that the only option was to return it for a refund.  Evidently it couldn't be exchanged unless it was ""damaged in transit"", which it was. Super frustrating.",0
5,soft & comfy,1
2,This produce is crap.,0
5,"Material feels very nice, kinda like velour. Beautiful color, great stretch and nice length. The bust area was lower than I expected. I ordered an XL but I easily could have bought a large. I usually wear  12/14",1
5,"One of my favorite tops! It is a little big on me, but I think that is the style. The material has a little shine to it, yes. I wear it with a white cami/tank and black leggings. SO comfortable",1
4,"I'm 5'9"", 200 lbs and I actually ordered the green dress and recieved the gray dress. I liked it so much I'm keeping it and trying to re-order the green this time as well. Hopefully it's the right color...",1
5,Exactly what we wanted.,1
2,"I was so disappointed & wanted this outfit to work badly. Most of my weight goes to my thighs and butt. While the blouse was a perfect fit, the pants we baggy and loose. The material is somewhat silly but thick as well. I gave 2 starts based on speedy delivery & the outfit itself is still cute nonetheless.<br /><br />Height: 5‚Äô4<br />Weight: 131 lbs<br />Jeans: Size 7",0
5,This bra fits just like it should and is super comfortable.,1
2,The synthetic smell could be sensed throughout the house for days after I opened the package.<br />I could not allow a child to wear this mask close to their face! :(,0
5,Came in on the day of my friends giving and were used all night. Couldn't be happier they are a great set for a great price point. Got many compliments on them. Highly recommend,1
5,Love these so much i purchased one in every color!,1
5,They‚Äôre great quality. They came early as well! We love them!,1
5,Omg I feel like I‚Äôm being hugged by a cloud. This is so soft. It fits great. It‚Äôs light weight so you can wear it in the summer. I absolutely love it,1
5,"Any woman who suffers from hot flashes, can truly appreciate going to bed and being able to toss and turn without waking up. The fitting is just right, not too short in the shoulders, not too tight below. They don&#34;t ride up ever. The quality of the fabric and the superb stitching is an indication that these satin short pajamas will last a very long time. So, that being said, I am going to buy more. Love the color options, but most of all if you have a hard time trying to find an X/L, this is the ticket. Hot in Alabama, but no longer suffering.",1
5,Fits great and keeps you cool.  Wears well and washes beautifully.,1
3,"The elephant is exactly the size I thought it would be.  The detail &amp; rhinestones are cute-- however, I am not able to wear it, yet, because it arrived with a broken chain.  I'm not even sure how it was even possible that it was broken in so many places.  The chain had at least 3 breaks.  I was possibly considering replacing the chain, anyway- but it sucks that it arrived damaged.",0
1,Terrible quality...do not purchase!,0
5,Bought these for the office but they were taken by my 4 year old. She has worn a few pairs and they are all over the house and car. No pairs have broken so far in her hands and it has been over a month. I like to keep them in the car as backups or for entertainment. I would buy again.,1
1,"Love the color, but these are thin. The pants roll down, and don‚Äôt have an elastic band around the waist. These pajamas also don‚Äôt have stitching on the ends on the shirt or pants, making them more likely to roll the fabric upwards.",0
5,comfortable and looks nice,1
3,okay,0
1,"Ok I think the fit of this will differ from child to child. My daughter is 39lbs, tiny and wears a 6. I got her the 7/8. It was big on top but not long enough. She had a wedgie from the moment she put it on. The light pink was completely see through, especially in the back. I had her wear short over it. She had a pull across the entire front  before she made it class the first time she wore it. We ordered the GK Minnie Mouse leotard and it is a million times better.",0
4,Very nice!,1
5,Wanted something just the right size for carrying swimwear to an from the gym and pool and this is just right!,1
2,"Horrible product. The rings are hard to open/close. I got them Monday,  I showered and then I put the rings on after my nose was dry. By the next day, the color was falling off and leaving residue over my nose.",0
4,Solved d purpose,1
5,Loved it but a little short on the crossbody. Small yet roomy.,1
3,The top was so cute and soft but unfortunately the inside itched like crazy! Wanted to keep these so bad.,0
1,Handle ripped after using bag for a month,0
3,"It looked great and fit was good also. Problem was after 2-3 washes the grey started turning like a peach color. Maybe it was the heat but for the price, I'd expect more.",0
4,Satisfied,1
2,I was so disappointed.Cute but very cheaply made. Love the disign and colors.,0
2,"The lace shoulders look delicatenin the picture and seem like an upgrade to your standqrd white tee. Instead of lace they are heavy crochet, do not lay down, feel awkward and even curl in random directions after washing. This shirt looks and feels like you are wearing football shoulder pads and is not really what i expected and defenitely not a shirt i like.  Do not recomend.",0
1,These are at least 5 sizes too small.,0
2,"Smaller than the sizing said they would be. Came with a hole in the left hand pocket. Light materials though, so would be very comfortable if they fit right.",0
1,These earrings are huge! If they were small I would have kept them but they are way way too big!  They look obnoxious!,0
1,The zipper is very poor. I will be returning the pocketbook. The zipper continually splits.,0
1,Shirts run a lot smaller from the first order I received.,0
4,Very pretty and unique ring.,1
5,Very comfortable love it,1
1,Letter fell off within a week,0
4,Liked them; slightly larger than I thought they would be,1

2,Beautiful coat but sizes are off buy up a size.,0
4,Nice blouse for money.,1
2,"I really wanted to love it. The size and color were perfect but the protective tissue paper got stuck all over it leaving sticky white spots. I was able to mostly clean off the white paper which left dull spots all over the bag.  I could have dealt with that, but the leather was also damaged in one spot.<br /><br />The good news is that the return was extremely fast and easy.  I was so excited for this one based on good reviews but it wasn‚Äôt as expected especially for the price.",0
4,"They are cute, but a little tight.",1
1,It‚Äôs only good for a week after the week it starts fading .,0
3,Turned colors and looks dirty now,0
1,Right shoe had very uncomfortable lump under the ball of right foot. Package was shipped in original box wrapped in a plastic shipping envelope. Original box was damaged. Just was a poor experience overall. Returned these and bought Skechers locally 30% cheaper and way more comfortable.,0

5,Nice,1
1,"The fabric is itchy and really poor quality. I ordered a full size up and it's still too small. There isn't even a label inside with the size, company, or care  instructions on it. Reallyith this item. Amazon don't let companies like this bring down your quality, you're going to loose costumers.",0
1,"Great idea... without design follow through.  This fits well and works... kind of.  The design could have been a home run if they would have brought the top down a few degrees (unblock the two A/C vents) and made the top and sides a little longer .  As it is, it blocks the top A/C vents blow to the roof and doesn't add much to shading the screen.",0
5,These are really comfortable and good looking,1
1,"Photos shows birds facing opposite directions, but face same direction in reality.",0
5,"Sized appropriately, fit great. Arrived quickly too. (US sizing, Here in days instead of 1.5 months from china LoL)",1
4,Nice looking shades and fairly priced plus the bifocal part makes them readers also.,1
1,NOT flattering. NOT med-large bust friendly.  The lace along the middle hit me in the worst place. T,0

3,The material is a little bit thin such as to make me a little bit self conscious...but everyone else thinks it is flattering.,0
4,"WEAR M GOT L FITS LIKE LEGGINGS BUT CUTE ME ,,,BODY SHAPE MAKES A DIFFERANCE",1
3,Was really hoping this would make me more aware of standing straighter.  But it just felt like I was strapped into a lot of hooks and fabric‚Äî a girdle for my chest.  I still have it in my drawer but I avoid wearing it because it‚Äôs cumbersome to get into and does not correct my posture as advertised.  Disappointing.,0
1,"These wouldn't lift and stay stuck, no matter what I did. Useless to me. I'm a heavy C cup.",0
3,"So I bought these to wear under my jeans when I take the dog for a walk during the frigid Chicago winter's.  They are very comfortable, stylish, and cute.  Do they keep my legs warm......ah........maybe a little.  I have an old pair of Cuddle Duds that are like 15 years old.  I bought these pants to replace my old Cuddle Duds.  I think I'm just going to keep wearing my old Cuddle Duds on super cold days.  While wearing these, my thighs got ice cold and numb in the 15 degree's and below range while my old Duds keep my thighs nice and warm in the same temperature.  I do like these, but for those freezing sub zero temperature's, they really don't keep you warm.",0
3,"So i had gotten this necklace & it was so pretty, a little smaller than expect but unfortunately i lost til so i reordered & this is the one that was sent to me. Sad that it is t the same",0

5,"I have worn Jess N Jane before.  I took a chance and ordered extra large because in the past I have purchased XL from other stores and once I washed them in warm water they fit me.  The shoulders are about one inch to large after washing but I can live with that.  I am very pleased with the three Jess N Jane shirts that I have ordered from Amazon, therefore I gave them a five star rating.",1
1,Looks gold in picture but arrived heavily tarnished with metal brittle and rusted. The metal looks downright dangerous. Will be trying to return!,0
1,"I ordered one and within a few weeks the rubber was starting to tear. To their credit, I was given a replacement quickly. However, it has been less than 6 months and although it lasted longer than the first time time, it is still falling apart way too quick. There isn‚Äôt an easy way to replace the rubber piece. Mine failed on both in the same spot. I tried a different brand recently that has two screws instead of one screw and one rubber loop thing. So far it has worked much better. I did buy little O-rings to add to it because that is perhaps the ONE thing this product did right over the other brand I bought. Otherwise this was trash after just a few months.",0
2,"Super cute shirt, however it fit weird. To fit great on the top but then was very boxy and short on the bottom.  I was sad to return this one.",0
1,These photos advertised the rings to be shinier than what they are. I'm extremely disappointed.,0

5,Very sweet and perfect for a little girl. The tiny Pearl is pretty set in the cross.,1
4,"Not the most comfortable, but that's not easily accomplished with extra cold weather gloves. I can't speak yet for durability. They seem they will last OK for snow blowing, shoveling, and general activity in very cold weather. Would not recommend for rugged hand work.",1

5,These are way cooler looking than some other light up shoes I've seen. My son is loving them and all the variety of light he can scroll through. We had to turn all the lights off in the house for a dance party with his new shoes!,1
4,"Minnesota is notorious for its mosquitos and I got a reviewer hat in perfect time for trying to find mushrooms.  In fact a week before it arrived, I got chased out of the woods by horse flies, so I was super excited to head back out armed with this hat.  And it did prove to work for the most part.  Aided with long sleeves and long pants I could wade through the swarms and look for mushrooms, but the screen ended up being a hinderance in being able to see mushrooms on the forest floor so I ended up pulling it up a lot.  In the end, the search was still a failure, but a far more comfortable failure.<br /><br />We also took it on a weekend trip to the bourndary waters and it served well enough during the twilight hours.  It is lightweight, reasonably one size fits all and interestingly designed.  I like that the net tucks into the zippered pouch on the top of the head and, while I would not want my high school crush to see me wearing it, it looks ok.  It definitely feels rugged enough to last us for the rest of our mosquito needs.  All in all, we like it, but it is still annoying enough that we can't love it.  Although when you have a huge swarm of mosquitos around your head, you are pretty fond of it.",1
5,great,1

2,"These are very cute pajamas, with pretty feminine accents like lace, bows and embroidery. I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they were waaaay too small for her. She is plus size and I wear small/medium and they almost fit me! Sizing is way off. So if you are a small, order a large.",0
2,"Some masks are unusable due to the closeness of the strap holes to the eye holes and the eye holes going across the entire mask. Once you try to put them on, the mask bends around your face and folds where the eye holes are. We ended up using these as decorations because no children could wear them comfortably",0
5,I love the double pack of the t-shirts. I will purchase more in the future.,1

These are the first earrings we've found that don't irritate her ears (even 14 K gold didn't work), so stainless steel is definitely the way to go for those with super sensitive ears. She likes changing earrings every day, so she loves that this set gives her so many options. The earrings are very pretty and sparkly except the dark pair (I can't figure out if they're black or a blue that's so dark that it looks black). If I could change one thing it would be that pair for a light sparkly blue pair. This set is still an amazing value in spite of one pair we don't use. For reference, I bought her the 4 mm which turned out to be the perfect size for a little girl.",1
1,"first time washed threads came loose and falling apart, to expensive not to be able to wash, bad product",0
5,I ordered these because I was leaving work with a killer headache after looking at a computer screen under fluorescent lights - 1 week of wearing them at work and a huge decrease in my discomfort! I also really liked that the lenses did not impact my vision since I already have great vision. The yellow tint of the lens is just enough that I don‚Äôt really notice it when I look away from a screen. Very pleased with these!!,1
2,So many good uses and still more left for later uses.,0
3,Daughter loved them but flowers fall off,0
3,"The product was fine and fits well, but the vendor won't stop bugging me for a review.  I doubt if I will deal with them again because of the constant annoying review requests!",0
5,"Cute shoes, fit well don enjoyed",1
1,cheaply made. flimsy and gaudy.,0
5,Order a size up. My husband wears a size 36. They were too tight,1
5,Love it!,1
1,The picture is so misleading I specifically bought this because my son wanted a hoodie with strings to tie ... THERE ARE NO STRINGS not even a place to put strings now I'm dealing with an upset 11 year old .. thanks,0
5,I bought this for my husband and he loved them,1
4,"I usually wear about a medium, i ordered a large - fit well.<br /><br />Ok - here's the thing - the fabric feels cheap, the buttons are hideously ugly up close, and the second button is placed to high so you have to either have it buttoned too high or unbuttoned too far (like you're trying to show off your chest a little)<br /><br />So why 4 stars?  Because I get non-stop complements when I wear this shirt.  It looks great - even the ugly buttons work, because from a few feet away they look like pearl-snap buttons.  So despite the drawback, I strongly recommend this shirt - you'll look great and strangers will stop you to give compliments.  Really.",1
3,These Bohemian earrings are fashionable and light weight but for me they didn't work.  My main issue is that two of the earrings require you to put the hook into a small hole and it is impossible.  Even when I try without the earrings on all I have managed to do is bend them.  I can't recommend this item because I feel only two pairs are usable.,0
2,The ears are great looking but very hard to get on and keep on.  We ended up getting a different pair that worked really well. These ears don't bend much. Pretty hard plastic,0
5,"Great stretch, don‚Äôt get sheer / see through. Wore these on hikes in Utah and water rafting. Very comfortable!",1
5,Perfect fit and beautiful quality and colors,1
5,This is a lovely card holder. The artwork is beautiful and it a nice change from plain metal cases. Does not looks cheap too.,1
5,Nice leg warmers,1
3,Lovely top but i find it hard to get into. Might need a wider neck opening,0
4,I love the fit but I'm 5'9 and they are almost capris on me.,1
5,"All the colors make it so easy to go with whatever I'm wearing. I like to tease my hair and put on a head band with one of these on it. It looks cute and accents the colors in my outfit. The size is perfect too. They aren't obnoxiously large or awkwardly small. I just wish that these ones had one prong on the clip instead of two, because it would make it easier to slide under the ribbon on my headbands.",1
3,Too cheeky for a 11year old. Top is cute but will be returning. Not appropriate,0
3,The length is fine but the part that goes up and over to the waist is weird fits fine in front but not in the back and very slick material that is always rolling down,0
3,"The quality is a little flimsy, but good at the price. I have been using them for a month now to store my dirty gym clothes, to avoid the reek from sinking into my gym bag. The seam appears to be heat pressed and separated a little bit at the edge closest to the top of the bag when I tried stuffing a sweaty judo gi in it.",0
5,I've had this wallet for months now and it's still in amazing shape! It's so cute- I get compliments all the time!,1
1,Ordered a 4X large states US size however received item to fit an extra large if that not good for plus size,0
1,The shoe material is defective.  After one half day of school Sept.4th this shoe totally started peeling.,0
5,"These are great if you have poor taste.  I needed them for a Kurt Cobain costume, soooooo they had to do.  But they are ugly just like the pic.  But they are exactly what you are ordering.",1
5,I thought it was going to be too big but it wasnt I got it and it fit perfect. I got a large and I absolutely love it. I'm very tall and athletecly built and it's like this dress was made for me!!!! So happy and I can't wait to wear it tomorrow on Christmas Day. Thank you so much for the beautiful dress!,1
3,They are too hard. Not soft enough .,0
5,Buy two because this is my sons favorite shirt! I have a hard time getting it off of him!,1
5,the watch band didn't last very long,1
3,"I bought two of these for Christmas gifts for snowbirds. They were a big hit. Nice size and they really sparkled. Great gift for anyone who loves Florida.<br />UPDATE...I loved this pin so much, I bought myself one. The very first day of wearing it, the clasp broke and I noticed when I got home it was no longer on my coat. I was very upset. I still had the clasp, but no flamingo.",0
3,Did not like the set up to start the watch<br />It could be a lot easier,0
4,"they are Adorable, warm and were comfy but the bottoms break down very easy. I don't think I would purchase again.",1
5,Fits great and looks great. Exactly what I was expecting,1
5,Hermosa. Me encantoooo,1
2,Smaller than thy appear on website,0
3,Top fits perfect but bottoms are a bit too cheeky for me!!,0
2,"This was dirty day one, and I've tried to clean it, not happening.  Liked the look but now its dirty and looks cheap, so I will have to buy a different one.",0
5,Love this sweater. It fits great high quality.,1
5,"My fifteen year old daughter chose this ring herself and I approved it based on it's reviews and the customer ratings of the company, Gem Avenue. It is a lovely fluid band of marked sterling silver with a moderate size cz that is maybe 3/4 carat but set down in an unobtrusive fashion like a channel set. The cz is clear and catches the light with faint sparkles of color at the right angle. It has been worn it for about a week and it still appears new. My daughter absolutely loves it and it does not look out of place on her finger. I find the ring to be dainty but not flimsy, and it was shipped very quickly in a darling, tiny gift box that my daughter was also thrilled with. Add all this together with the VERY reasonable price and I'd say we have a very happy customer.",1
4,"The pendant is too small for me... but other than that, it's perfect.",1
2,Earringswith coloring faded quickly...the stainless steel ones are fine.  Should have just ordered a set of those instead of wasting money on a multi-colered selection that did not sustain color well.,0
4,"These necklaces are pretty, and have a bright sheen to them. The hammered coin is really nice. The thing is, I don‚Äôt think of these as chokers at all, just shorter necklaces. To me a choker comes up much higher on the neck, and the coin especially dangles to just above the cleavage. They look nice together, or separately, and are a fun set to wear, either dresses up a bit, or more casually.",1
1,Don't do it. Bottoms are see-thru and the fit and fabric are awful.,0
5,"I've looked forever, or so it seems, for the perfect pair of blue shoes to go with three different sundresses. Not only are these shoes the perfect shade of blue, they are the perfect fit. Extremely comfortable and cute as can be!",1
1,Not kids size despite description,0
2,The sleeves are shorter than expected and the hood is smaller than expected.,0
5,"I'm 5'2, around 190 lbs and ordered the large. It fit perfectly and really showed off my growing belly. I will say it wrinkles very easily and had to steam it prior to wearing. Overall great purchase and plan to purchase in different colors.",1
2,Size too large. Son unable to wear.,0
5,Nice bag.,1
5,Great watch bracelet a little light otherwise nice buy.,1
5,This was gift for my granddaughter.  She love it!! Good quality ring.,1
1,"The plastic insert tab that holds the inserts in the wallet slot on both units tore away from the inserts within 3 days of use.  If it did not cost me to return them, I would have.  I would not recommend these.",0
1,This is basically a sticker on a hat,0
1,Very cute...only problem is you can‚Äôt put down the windows. I‚Äôve lost them so many times and had to stop and pick them up . Would be nice to figure out how to have them stay on. I had to keep them on the back windows since we use those less.,0
5,Fit as they should.  Comfortable and great looking.  Thanks Dan,1
4,"These are very pretty, but one of the clips is looser than it should be. They‚Äôre quite dressy, but look great with jeans too.",1
2,Too narrow at toe so returned it. Cute style.,0
5,My kids and my husband all love their mask !! Good quality love love love,1
5,"This hat is super cute...bought one for me and one for my BFF and we are both using these on our next vacation...Mine was a little snug, but I like that so it will not easily blow off on a cruise.  =-)",1
3,"The dress is really cute.  I would love it except for the sizing.  I ordered an XL after reading the reviews.<br />I am 40 38 41.  5‚Äô5‚Äù.  160#<br />Front wrap crossed over maybe four inches  At the waist.  Opens up when you walk.<br /><br />Would have to wear a top underneath, wide open.  The snap closure it even close.  Not for larger breasts. Full bra showing.<br />Gave it to my daughter",0
5,"These are the only socks that stay on my babies feet. I've tried other brands but they fall off. These hold on without cutting into the leg. One of my twins has more meat on his legs, and these don't leave a massive indent. A small one, yes, but it goes away fairly quickly after socks are removed.",1
3,Color and texture are excellent...fits small even though I ordered a size up already,0
1,I cant even wear these! They run super small like gir a child's face. Super disappointing!,0
1,Make are cheap and to large,0
5,Great price and my sone loved these,1
5,I have a long torso but it fit perfectly,1
1,"Tela corriente, no tiene forma la chaqueta ya que todo esta fl√°cido cuello costuras la tela es como lickra delgada un gran fiasco. No lo recomiendo",0
5,Good quality. My husband loves it!,1
1,Avoid this bag. On the fourth use it ripped around an end seem. Never even got to fill the bag up. Just a few clothes and a pair of shoes for a weekend trip.,0
3,Fit fine...threading coming apart. Sent it back,0
1,Looks cheap,0
5,"I needed a good, sturdy watch for everyday and this one fits the bill. It doesn't look like your typical Victorionox Swiss Army Watch, it's got much more pizazz you might say. I love wearing it, can't stop looking at it!",1
3,Positives -They are super adorable and fit great.  They look exactly like the pictures. For the price it's a good deal.<br /><br />Negatives - The material is like a flimsy swimsuit spandex. Everytime I breath in the liner sucks up into my nose and mouth. I think a stiff filter will help fix this problem.,0
5,"The 2 pack black and tan side medium, arrived way sooner than I expected, like within days, even though I was prepared to wait a month:) I am 5'5&#34;, 140-160 at any given time of the month, with a juicy belly. I put these on under my jeans, and looked hot again, totally tucked me in and smoothed me out... Yes they do tend to roll at the top, but I think that is just because I am not as big above as below my vagomach/fupa. I used a shape wear tank top over them and felt like a million bucks. They are a bit uncomfortable around &#34;that time of month&#34; and a little bit of my saggy butt cheeks hang out, but again in jeans they look great, tights with a long top great...i would purchase again perhaps to try another size,( to counteract the rolling) and yes at $10 a pair it's a good deal, but I would like to see that price drop a couple bucks...",1
3,"One time use only. They are a pain to put in, and after one use they are done. but they worked for what I needed them for (saving my wedding shoes).",0
2,I just pulled received it today and pulled it out of the package and the tassel was already broken. :( It was perfect otherwise and the color/style was exactly what I was looking for.,0
5,"Absolutely love these shorts!!!  Fit, comfort and style has me definitely ordering more !!!",1
5,"It arrived on time, intact, and as described. My friends daughter enjoyed the gift. Nice design and colors.",1
1,"It's not a bad hoodie. I just wouldn't pay $40 for it. It's definitely not as warm as I thought it would be. It's fairly thin. The zipper is also on the wrong side. The pockets are pretty warm, though.<br /><br />Edit: I changed my review from 3 stars to 1 star because after having the hoodie for a week the zipper broke. Still waiting to hear from the company about the return of this horrible, cheaply made product.",0
1,"Maybe it is my figure, but it made my waist look weird. Did not like it on me.",0
4,"While the quality of the necklace is somewhat low, it seems sturdy enough and came with very cute card and envelope packaging. Appropriate value for money. The recipient adored it!",1
3,Love the lenses and fit over glasses is great.  Only bad things are the sides.  Limits peripheral vision which is necessary for driving,0
5,excellent.thank,1
5,Price and reliability,1
2,Home printed iron-on quality. Not bright & crisp like the photo.  My kid did like it though.,0
1,"I'm usually a L in most name brand clothing (5'4&#34;, 36D/8-10 pant), but saw the reviews that this ran small, so I ordered an XL. IT WAS TINY. Not only was it skin tight, it was super short and come close to fitting like the model. The XL was much more like a S. Luckily it had free return, so I sent it back.",0
3,its okay,0
3,"I purchased a similar item with another seller and this one does not suck in my stomach the way the other tights did. These tights also roll down while working out, which can be annoying. I'm not sure if I would be purchasing more since the quality feels cheap.",0
3,"It is a very huge purse, which is what I am trying to get away from.  The purse itself is nice though.",0
1,Unbelievable! It's a shame the tie I really wanted in the photo is not what I received. Very thin material and cheaply made. Very disappointed!,0
4,I like everything about this tunic except I wish the neck were not quite as wide. I like the solid top and figure at the bottom.,1
4,Cute little cuppies! My son took the white one and I use the pink one. I put it in my phone when I bought it and it's STILL there! No issues...love it!,1
4,It ran small so I didn‚Äôt keep it but it was very pretty and a good quality.  I ordered the Medium needed a large because the waist elastic was strong. I could have worn it but it would‚Äôve been uncomfortable.,1
1,Clasp broke after 1 wear,0
5,"Very cute, works well so far",1
5,Tasteful looking wallet and plenty of space.,1
3,"My 3yo really liked these glasses. We made sure to put them in the protective sleeve when not in use. The lenses haven‚Äôt gotten scratched up. But the left screw kept coming loose. I had to keep tightening it, only to recently notice that the hinge is cracked. Now I need to replace them. Really disappointed.",0
3,Really cute paired with leggings. I wore with cropped legging. Was very cute but it's a little short in length and tight in bust on me. I am a 38DD chest.,0
1,"These seem fine if you are sitting or just standing, but start walking and within 3 minutes thy are down to your knees.  Waste of money.  I should have returned them before I wore them.",0
5,Lovely. I know I will enjoy them.,1
3,"I got a XL, and while it does fit, I feel like it runs on the smaller side/is short. I realize the cropped look is in, but it does seem shorter to me than pictured. The color is nice, but is slightly lighter than what you see pictured. It‚Äôs a good red wine color. The floral stitching is as pictured, if not better looking than pictured.",0
1,"This purse should have been $5 !! This purse is extremely smallllllll!! It‚Äôs dirty, looks used!! Scratched at the bottom!! And thread coming out",0
2,"Update: This morning after attempting to latch the band around my wrist, one of the connector pieces broke.  So now the band is useless to me.  I only wore the band maybe 5 times before it broke.<br /><br />Looks great, and I'm happy very happy with the aesthetics. My only complaint with the band is figuring out how to wear it, without the band getting under the watch. Most days I have no problem, but occasionally I need to keep unlocking my watch because the band has gotten underneath the face, and the watch thinks it has been removed.",0
5,"Fits my watch great, is comfortable and looks good.",1
5,Just like the picture,1
5,comfortable and fit well,1
5,Cute sparkly shoes! They match a variety of outfits for my 4 yr old. The elastic strap gives a nice amount of extra support.,1
1,The print of the shirt was upside down.,0
3,Cute charms with good quality on the image itself but they constantly fell of the ring,0
5,"First and foremost this is a very cute onesie.  The layered look of the top really makes this outfit pop and look both adorable and fancy at the same time so I can wear this out shopping, etc (with a skirt over the bottom of course) .  Daddy said this looks amazing with my denim miniskirt.  The fit was good  and was true to the LFB size chart.  The material was very soft and of good quality (not too thin, not too thick).  I loved the colors and patterns and  it is super comfortable.  The only drawback I found is the snaps in the crotch are the plastic ones and I've had issues with those in the past on different brand onesies, but these did feel fairly solid, so am optimistic they will hold up to extended use.",1
4,Very nice so far.  The RFID definitely works.,1
3,"All in all, I suppose you get what you pay for here. Just don't order it expecting too much. The look and feel of the item are illustrated here by its price. Fury suit items are pricey, especially the good ones. This was bought for a child to play with, so considering I suppose it's an Okay buy.",0
1,Not worth it!! Broke the first time I wore them! Made from cheap material!,0
3,"Great looking shirt, but had to return because the sleeves were too short in M, L, and L+, at which point the rest of the shirt was loose. Sleeves don't increase much along with the rest as the size increases. May work for people with shorter arms.",0
5,Love love love! I was expecting this shirt to be a bit small but it fits perfectly. Definitely my new favorite top!,1
3,"The stone looks beautiful pink on the picture, but in the reality is mainly white than pink .",0
2,"They are a cute style and I liked the colors on the two pair I bought but they are over a half size too large. Very large opening at the heel. Also zero arch support.<br />Trying to figure out how to return them. All of these things arrive with zero paperwork now. Another reason for only two stars. Shoes thrown in a box, box thrown in another box with no padding just sliding around loose in larger box.",0
3,Really cute outfit but the top just fits.  Runs small.,0
1,I put these on thinking I was going to go to the gym. Looked in the mirror and long behold you could see everything because they are see through!,0
1,"This T-shirt was such a disappointment to my wife. She loves bees and really liked the sweet, but simple message on this pastel t-shirt. When she checked the product page and saw that it said the top was 100% cotton, she was so excited! But when the product arrived, she was disappointed in several ways.<br /><br />The moment she took the shirt out of the packaging, she knew something was wrong. It felt synthetic. Sure enough, the tag said the fabric content was actually 95% polyester and 5% cotton. That‚Äôs a HUGE difference than what was stated on the product page!!! My wife gets overheated and her body reacts to the chemical composition of polyester, so there was no way she could wear this.<br /><br />She tried it on anyway to review it, and the shirt fit perfectly. However, the light-colored fabric is quite sheer, so you can see your undergarments. That‚Äôs yet another reason she won‚Äôt wear it.<br /><br />In addition, this shirt is not made that well. The tag recommends that you dry clean this shirt, which is ridiculous, even for polyester. But you may want to wash it on the delicate cycle, since the hems of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt are single-folded and are likely to unravel. The serge stitching on the seams and hems is loose, so it may come undone, too. The screen-printed design looks great now, but could become damaged if you machine wash and dry it.<br /><br />Our final objection is regarding the price. If this shirt was constructed properly of all-cotton fabric, then it would be worth around $16. However, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd want to pay $13-19 for a mostly polyester shirt.",0
5,Love it!,1
1,Bought this at a discount but wasn‚Äôt worth the $2. The ring is bulky and the edges are hard. It‚Äôs too uncomfortable to wear.,0
5,"Perfect shirt! Image was great, color was great! Size was right on!",1
4,"I just wish there were more white and pink.  The colors used most.  They were not a big as I thought they were, but they are nice puffs.",1
4,it's a nice thickness so it layers well,1
1,"I don‚Äôt give any stars because my surprise when I opened it with  cat or dog hairs and the smell was opening as if  someone use because the yarns of the stamen., were erased . And I‚Äôm Alergy to Cats and Dogs. POOR QUALITY and shame to send a ordered bad condition, I WILL NEVER Order and this COMPANY .",0
5,Gorgeous detail and yet not too much of a statement piece. Picky boyfriend loved them!,1
1,"They look nice but the shoes are not safe for kids they are very very slippery, you could wear it only once out of the house.",0
3,"Design is cool but unfortunately the latch comes open very easily. Also, the finish scratches off fairly easily too. I wouldn't consider for every day use. My keys have came off numerous times in a store, luckily I found them every time.",0
3,The t shirt was to small I wanted a 1x. I like the color of it,0
2,The buttons on the dress have no functionality.  They are merely for looks.,0
3,"I purchased this t-shirt because of the message it has printed on it. As item arrives,  it is so pretty, very colorful, material is very soft and comfortable and as I wore it, I did receive many compliments. What I did noticed was that in the first wash ( and I did wash it on delicate cycle), the black print got discolored. It doesn't have that vibrant black bold color any more.",0
5,Best money I have ever spent,1
3,"It fits as expected and the pattern is lovely, but it feels like tent material, clingy in all the wrong places, and just overall not very flattering.",0
3,"The fabric bleeds when washed. Thus, the color of this blouse fades over time.",0
5,Love them and gave them out as gifts.,1
5,This tank top is adorable! I got lots of compliments when I wore it to yoga this week - and it was even comfortable wearing while doing some yard yoga in the 90 degree weather this week! The fabric is thick enough that you don't have to worry about it being see-thru or clinging funny. The seller told me that it tends to run a little small so I ordered a medium when I usually get a small and the medium fit like a dream! I would definitely suggest sizing up and then wearing it all the time! I am thinking about ordering it in white too! So flattering. Thank you!,1
5,My favorite purse,1
4,"Got these for my three year old who is obsessed with monsters and dinosaurs, so it works on both fronts. They're comfy, cute, and tons of fun for him to play pretend with. They fit him pretty well, so I'm guessing will be too small for the older kids.",1
4,But loses shine,1
5,"I read the review. Size is wrong. Too big. Since I ordered much smaller size than my feet, fits perfect.<br />Great sandals!",1
3,Nice looking,0
2,They're good quality socks but they only go mid calf. This causes them to say and they end up cutting off circulation below the calf and increasing the edema above.,0
3,"I love how comfy these are. Pretty & slim fitting for pjs. But I‚Äôve had them only a couple of months and they‚Äôre wearing very quickly... starting to become seethrough in the pants. Maybe not surprised as it‚Äôs a lightweight fabric.<br /><br />For sizing help: wear a 28 jean, 34c, and medium top and 6 dress, usually, and I ordered a Medium. Fits well.",0
4,"Like the pants.  Fit great!  I would definitely buy them again.  Only problem I have is the pricing of one pair vs. another.  That is why I only bought one pair.  If they had all been priced the 19.99 AND had the size I needed, I would definitely have bought more than one pair.",1
5,Bought this is a present for a co-worker and she loves it! Always gets complimented on it,1
5,Such a beautiful bag. I love the pebbled leather. It‚Äôs the perfect size I was looking for. It has a zip closure and I love that the strap has a loop so the strap can stay down.,1
5,I was so in love with this design when I saw it but got really irritated when I saw they only had it up to a 16. I'm a true size 18 but I decided to take a chance and get it. I'm so glad I did! It fits! And I love it! And the price was nice as well.<br />It looks great on and it is well constructed. I like that they have molded breast padding inside the top that keeps your nipples from showing through as well as keeping your boobs from jiggling so much.  I'll look cute at the pool on my vacay.,1
1,Broke very fast and want money back,0
1,Poorly made item broke the first time I tried to put it on. Do not buy!,0
2,Was missing the bag and jewelry.  But had it all been there I‚Äôm sure we would have kept it.,0
3,Nice material but I ordered them because they were supposed to be Capri length but they are way to long,0
5,"This bush hat is amazing on so many levels. It performs as it was designed to. I bought this a few years ago. I wear it every spring, summer,  and fall. It actually keeps you cool in hot weather. It keeps sweat and the sun out of your eyes and off your head. At times, off of your shoulders as well. It also protects you from insects like gnats, you can even spray it with bug spray for added protection. You can spray it with CampDry to keep your head dry in the rain. I even wore it in a wind storm. The strap kept it on my head, it never flew off. This headgear is very light but tough. It fits perfectly, just be sure to know your hat size. This is perfect for hunting, hiking, fishing, bicycling, boating, cutting grass. It folds and packs easily in a cargo pocket or backpack. The Flecktarn camouflage is the best camouflage around.",1
5,"First off, this belt is as good for women as it is for men, despite the product description (that currently says ""...FOR MEN.""<br /><br />In the package are four heavy-duty nylon belts in the type of colors that do not clash with anything.  It's very durable and well-stitched and the release mechanism is intuitive, very easy to detach.  The belt won't fit through the loops of dress pants, better suited for the kind of pants with wide loops.  I can see these belts lasting for a long time, great for MOLLE or ALICE gear.",1
1,The wig was not completely attached to the mask,0
2,So incredibly small and uncomfortable. I had to do some serious cutting before it was even wearable and still was painful. Not made for adult humans,0
3,"I purchased these socks because I read a review from a plus-sized customer saying that they fit her.  Unfortunately, the same was not true for the person I gifted these to.  To preface: she does have a large shoe size (12-13) and is a plus-sized woman.  These socks would not come up past her ankles.  These socks aren't very thick, nor are they very stretchy, but the sewing seems to be decent and the seams at the toe looks secure.  The best feature, in my opinion, is their brightness (which was one of the reasons I picked them!).  The colors are vibrant and fun, so I can't complain there.",0
1,These are very short. They apear longer in the picture.,0
4,"Lovely, good looking garment but the XL was much bigger than what I expected.<br />Seller shipped quickly and the garment is very nice.",1
2,I bought 2 the blue and the pink one the arrived with one missing stone,0
5,Love  it,1
3,For the value you get all the pieces you need includding the tikka...the quality is low budget and some beads come loose but its not hard to fix if you have super glue on hand. Very heavy also. But overall a good value.,0
2,"These pants started out ok. Fast forward about 6 months later and I'm constantly hiking them up. The stretch is weak and doesn't hold over time. Not worth the money, even though they were not expensive.",0
1,I just received these shoes. I don‚Äôt like them because there is no support. I want to return them.,0
1,It had cosmetic flaws - I sent it back.,0
2,"I liked that it came with free returns. One set had defective knots and rather exploded when tried to put them on. The other pair seemed just fine. Due to time constraints, I didn‚Äôt reorder to see if defect was a fluke.",0
2,I've been bamboozled. These are not touch screen compatable. I tried different pressure and different screens. These are cute and warm but do not work for my phone which is a disappointment,0
5,"I bought this as a small gift for someone and worried it might look cheap or tacky - no, it was great. She loved it and the quality is excellent!",1
2,"I needed a new pair of cargo shorts, and wanted some with zipper pockets. These seemed to fit the bill.  All the tags on the pants were in a language other than English, including the ""inspection"" tag. Obviously the inspectors don't really put much effort into inspecting anything because as you can see in the photo, one of the pockets isn't actually attached to the pants themselves. This is problematic because this means if you put something in that pocket, that object will fall directly to the ground.  The other pockets are attached correctly though.  You're better off just buying a known brand, the prices are similar.",0
2,"If it stated that this was suppose to be a super thin shirt, I didn't see it. Had I known it was super thin and not a sweatshirt, I wouldnt have ordered it. Also the neck is too big. It had good potential though, I guess.",0
4,Runs small,1
3,"But really easy to loosen and remove even if you don't know the code. I'm not sure if this is really a good purchase or not :/ I wish I hadn't bought it, but I also travel by plane most of the time. Maybe that makes a difference?<br /><br />Bright side- the strap itself seems very sturdy.",0
5,Beautiful green color fits wonderfully!,1
5,Every bit as pretty when received. Very lightweight,1
3,"I can wear a large in most things and this was very tight, with very little stretch.  Cute overall, but no way someone with a 40 inch bust can wear the large.  Also, was not allowed to exchange, only return, and I had gotten it on sale so I won't be re-purchasing.",0
5,It is a thin tie,1
1,The print looks like I can peel off with my hand or after one wash,0
2,Really small,0
4,"I bought these for my granddaughter to help her buttonless sweater close.  She's at that age where she wants to hide...""things"".  These clips were so pretty, matched her outfit wonderfully and I can't wait for the occasion to come up so these can be worn again!",1
5,"The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is the short straps can‚Äôt be taken off and I can‚Äôt tuck them into the bag when I want to use the long strap. I personally like the long strap better but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great bag! Sturdy and super cute, goes with just about every outfit and holds A LOT of stuff. I have used it pretty much every day since I got it in December. I saw some comments about it smelling really bad but I didn‚Äôt have that problem. I love it!",1
5,"It‚Äôs beautiful , vibrant and just perfect to put a smile on frozen fansü•∞",1
1,There was a stone missing and pendant tend to hang backwards,0
2,Two stars because it was cute. The top was way too small for a dd and the skirt was really long.,0
5,"Great rings, love the colors. One to match everything.",1
3,Quality is great but it didn't have a good fit. Color was great but I wouldn't recommend at this time.,0
5,"Great quality, I‚Äôve used these a lot for hiking and Going to the gym",1
5,"This is probably the first time in my life I have taken the time to review anything. I LOVE this watch!!! Just as pictured. Perfect size for me (really not mini and still gives that trendy large look, but the full size Bradshaw watch I tried on in a local department store was so huge and heavy). Also ordered another mini Bradshaw with the gold face at the same time and this one is so much nicer! The off-white face is really pretty and goes well with my platinum wedding ring without having to do a two-tone metal watch. One thing I didn't realize is that the band itself is different too. This one is a much softer gold than the one with the gold face and looks much classier. As far as I can tell, this is the current model of the gold mini Bradshaw on the Micheal Kors website...just $100 cheaper!",1
5,Love these! They‚Äôre too big but that‚Äôs my fault and I‚Äôm sure I can tighten!,1
1,"I usually wear 1-2x and ordered a 2x. Didn't fit well at all in the bust area but fit everywhere else. I would think it'd fit 34F bra, but the bust area felt like I needed to be 4 cup sizes bigger for how much room there was, and the material looks cheap like it'll rip from the tiniest snag.",0
3,good color but tinny.,0
3,El material es muy delgado y se transparenta todo por lo cual lo proteje nada del sol.,0
5,Loved this for daughter to wear under Halloween costume. Next level softness & well priced & delivered quickly.,1
5,Soft & fun to wear.,1
2,I ordered an xl expecting it to fit small. An xl equals a small in regular clothes. I'm 5 2&#34; 115 and the xl fit there wasn't too much room like in the picture,0
5,Love them,1
5,"My Granddaughter Wears this as often as She can. I actually bought Her another One Of The ""Southern Attitude"" Series. As A Side Issue, These Shirts Hold Up Really Well. Therefore,You Are Getting A Well-Made Product ~",1
5,Muy hermoso,1
3,Not as big as I wanted it to be I do like it but was hoping for a larger size it fits small to medium it is not as large as the picture makes it look unless you have a very small child like head or a empty head with no brain this is the ideal hat.,0
5,"Came much faster than expected, fits good on my large head, keeps the GA sun off my face and looks very good doing it. I love the flowers and the bling, I like the shape, doesn't crush my hair.",1
4,I love the earrings  but wish I did not have to buy the necklace with it!,1
5,Soft and comfortable,1
5,"In this blue-light glasses,uh, these is a very good advantage, that is, it is very light and has no weight at all, so there is no burden on it. Since I put it on, I feel that my eyes are not so tired when I look at the computer all day. I also wear them out for they looked good on me. Come with a nice case.",1
1,This necklace is extremely disappointing.There is no adjuster and no way to get it around your neck.,0
5,For the price these are great to have around especially if you have younger kids.  The lights are very bright and seem to have a very long battery life,1
3,The rubber on the arms feel off,0
5,These earrings are so cute and so pretty! I‚Äôm very happy with these!,1
2,They loosen up easily and fall out,0
2,Lame. Zipper broke with a pair of very flat shoes in it,0
5,Just what we needed for our last ski trip. My sons loved them and were warm while skiing in Montana.,1
3,not what was expected,0
5,"Very light weight, material seems to be good!",1
5,Very comfortable shirts great for work outs and just relaxing,1
5,Fits great. Light weight and comfortable.,1
4,"I'm satisfied with them. I bought these for working outside in my yard. They are cheap and you get what you pay for. The reading part is a little too big but other than that, they're good for what I needed them for.",1
5,This pajama set was a great deal and I love the way they feel on me. Very soft material with beautiful colors. Fits just a expected.,1
1,They were great until I washed them the first time and then there were little balls ALLLLLL over them,0
2,"Great looking purse, but has strong odor when I unwrapped it from packing.  Hope it goes away. Had it airing out for &#62; 24 hours so far. Still smells",0
1,"I‚Äôm soooo mad and disappointed. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 140, 34D, 29‚Äù waist and bought an XL hoping for a crop twist front sweater that would fit in a fairly relaxed but still cropped way. I couldn‚Äôt even get it on!!! It‚Äôs literally microscopic. Maybe a child‚Äôs medium at most. I tried putting my arms in and couldn‚Äôt go past my biceps (which are of normal size for my body, I promise). This has got to be one of my top 5 worst clothing purchases with the whole Asian sizing issue... however, if someone could re-make this style to fit as it should, I‚Äôd totally buy it!!",0
2,You get what you pay for.  Fabric is cheap feeling and heavy.  Not what I needed for the summer.,0
3,"These are really cute leggings, the pattern looks identical to the popular Formation Camo at LLL. Unfortunately, the fit is all off for me. I typically wear a Large or 8/10 at Lulu so I ordered a Large in these first. When I tried them on the waist was not high enough for me to feel comfortable and the super slick material didn‚Äôt stay up. So I returned the size large and ordered an XL. I still had the same problems, waistband isn‚Äôt high enough and they continually slide down just walking around the house.<br /><br />I would say these are fine for lounging or athleisure wear but I wouldn‚Äôt wear these for a workout. They are super cute, the material feels good, soft and slick, but the fit just isn‚Äôt right for performance for me.",0
1,I was disappointed in the quality of the fabric which I found unpleasantly synthetic. The finishing of the wrap neckline was done with large white machine stitching which was conspicuous on a dark blue dress. It went back immediately and at least I can praise the ease of returning the garment.,0
5,"Great for the price! I think they are so cute and they didn't give my ears any sort of problem.  The only complain I would have is that they are a little big, especially the reindeer and snowmen.  I also had to use different backs, since the ones they came with weren't very secure, but who doesn't have 100000 earring backs?",1
5,First saw this shirt on 60 Days In. Had to get it.,1
5,"My husband was really thrilled with this hat! He loved it and it immediately got a place of honor in The Vault of Excellent Hats. Which is why no pic, it made it‚Äôs way up in the Sacred Closet Shelf as soon as he opened it. Carefully put in the front of a row of his collected hats, the really nice ones he only occasionally wears. He will pick out the one he wants to wear when we go ‚Äúout‚Äù - to dinner, visit friends etc. Yes we have adapted to our country home of 25 years, on 9 acres in the the sticks,  5 acres of which is a pond. We have converted to Midwest hicks who have ‚Äúdress‚Äù brimmed baseball  hats lol. It has pride of place among the Coast Guard, NYFD, FBI, and many more.<br /><br />To the hat‚Äôs quality, I can say it is well made, thick material and well sewn and put together. The embroidered insignia is well sewn and tightly and neatly applied. It is a high quality lid indeed. If you have a hat lover or collector, this would be a really great gift. I guarantee they will like it",1
5,"I loved these so much, I went and bought 3 more pairs. These are super soft, and I got lots of compliments on them. Can't wait to buy more colors.",1
4,"It is a bit tight in the band, but it works.  I wish the hat breathed a bit more, as it gives me absolutely terrible hat-head, but I didn't expect anything different given it was 100% Polyester. I appreciate being able to keep this rolled up in my purse for those times I need a hat, but did not plan appropriately.",1
4,Great design and fit. Runs a little on the small side.,1
1,I was supprised to find this defect in such nice pants. Otherwise their awesome pants I was going to buy more of.,0
5,Very soft fabric.  Nice construction and great value.  I have been living in these shorts!,1
1,These run very small. I think they would fit my friend‚Äôs 10 year old daughter better than me.,0
2,There was no way these were going to fit on my dad‚Äôs legs even though we measured carefully and ordered according to their sizing.  Returned them.,0
4,Nice quality  sterling silver earrings. They are lightweight and nice and shiny.,1
4,It's cute for casual or work.,1
5,Great purchase. Goes well with other gold bracelets I wear. Doesn't seem to tarnish and looks nice along with wearing a watch. I‚Äôll<br />Be purchasing more.,1
2,"Two stars, because the quality seems really nice, but they sent the WRONG ITEM!  I made this purchase after having frantically searched my local area for a black bandeau bikini and not having found anything.  This was supposed to be for a last-min weekend getaway, and I even paid for the one-day shipping.  I was completely crushed when I opened the package to find a ruffled string bikini top (the bottoms looked the same as pictured).  I might have just lived with it even though I don't like the ruffles, had it at least been a BANDEAU, which was the whole point, but it is a sting bikini top!  I cannot remove the straps, or just push them down--it's a halter, and it's needed for keeping the top on at all! I don't want tan lines, thus the bandeau.  I will be returning this item, and am so disappointed not to have had the amazing bikini pictured for my weekend away.",0
5,It‚Äôs very comfortable and fits perfect underneath my scrubs,1
4,Like it.,1
3,love this skirt! the material is a little cheap feeling but i get compliments every time i wear it out! super easy to pair with too and adds major color,0
1,the shades started peeling,0
5,Grandbabys loved wearing these too school made them feel a little halloweeny,1
5,"After looking at tons of watches and reading lots of reviews, I landed on this watch for my husband. He loves it! Looks classy enough for work, but not too dressy to wear with jeans. I was impressed with the quality for the price!",1
5,"Definitely worth what I paid. Arrived early, fits well, reasonable quality.",1
3,"I was shopping for a Smart Watch, but I cannot have any device that transmits or receives where I work. Also, I wanted a watch that is solar-powered so I will never have to worry about changing batteries. That limits options for solar-powered which has many features ‚Äúlike‚Äù a Smart Watch.<br />This watch was one of the top choices.<br />It is a nice watch, but not worth the $200 Retail Price listed by Casio, nor the current price at Amazon ($125) ... $70-$80 would be a more reasonable price.<br />The sensors are inconsistent and unreliable.<br />For instance, I can get drastic differences in Altitude for the same exact location each day, and the thermometer measures case temperature, which is basically skin temperature while wearing it on your wrist ... you have to take the watch off for at least 20 minutes to get any kind of accurate temperature reading.<br />Also, even though I have left the watch in direct Sun for many hours (over several days), the battery charge level never gets above M (Medium).<br />I had another solar-powered Casio G-Shock watch that I had for over 15 years, and had traveled around the World. It worked flawlessly until it recently kept freezing when trying to synchronize (WaveCeptor) with the Atomic Clock in Fort Collins (Colorado), which only works in most of the Continental United States.",0
5,Fast shipping.  And LOVE this shirt.  I wear it a lot.,1
5,"They‚Äôre fantastic! First thing i noticed was oncoming headlights were no longer bright or glaring. They yellow tint feels a little bit like day time. 2 things to be mindful of; corners may be very dark when looking in rear view mirror, try to keep your eyes focused & don‚Äôt use them in rain- it gets pretty blurry",1
5,I keep my house and garage keys permanently attached to the small end.  Then I can clip on any set of keys depending upon what car I'm driving that day.  Works like a champ.  Perfectly sized.,1
5,Great dress! I'm a medium in most things but returned the first one for a small. Love that it has pockets!,1
1,"Very cheap, felt material that was rough and has no give. Was afraid it would tear just putting it pn. Sizing small.",0
5,Recomendado,1
1,Well that was a waste. Ordered 00s and they are 0s. Should have known...,0
3,charries came off the key ring ..<br />for what it cost was too high for it to come apart.,0
3,"Super cheap material is not the most comfortable, but it's not bad. Price was cheap, so was expected. It's cute on. I like it. I wear an XL in most tops and this fit fine.",0
2,Waste. Colors are nice. Just strings tied in knots. The excess string is to much.,0
3,"I had take off tags before trying, so I'm going to give it to one of my teensy sisters.",0
3,"Other than that, it is a really beautiful hat.",0
2,"These are cute, however the actual quality is so poor! The gemstones are loose in all three and look like they are going to fall out. Plus the actual quality and look of the gems is also a little poor. I was really looking forward to these and I am very disappointed. I may return them.",0
2,"They look nice but they are mismatched, one like the picture and the other clear.",0
5,just right to take when you don't want to carry a big purse I like it,1
2,Dont buy your size because it will shrink a full size and be useless.<br />fabric is soft and light weight.<br />Beautiful colors just like pictured.<br />No smell of unwashed dye/vinegar or plastic packaging,0
5,These are very durable glasses for the price. Made by smith so they are quality!,1
3,"If you plan to use this shirt for layering, error towards a size smaller. She new this shirt tends to shed.",0
5,These Guess sneakers are not only stylish but they are very comfortable. My only disappointment is the black &#34;G&#34; logo on the side soles did wear off rather quickly but can't really complain as I just love the look and comfort they provide.,1
1,I bought this because I thought it would make me look like a ninja at work. But I just look like a retard. Don't let this happen to you,0
1,They did not hold together,0
1,"I put this on my keychain and it broke off less than a month later. Note, I am not hard on keychains.... I hang them up on a rack at home and in my purse when I am just out and about. Initially I thought it nice and sturdy but apparently what connected it to the ring was not.",0
4,"Outfit is very pretty, cloth is super soft.I like the color of dress and it‚Äôs machine washable.",1
1,Broken peices.  Can't fill my orders due to not having enough of the peices!!!!,0

3,"BASIC TEE SHIRT, DOES WHAT I EXPECT",0
5,"I received two pair of Christmas socks‚Äîone pair is black with red toes and heels and has red and green snowflakes and green Christmas trees on it.  The other pair is red with a white band around the top, it has white snowflakes and a bear on them.  Both pair are very cute and good quality.  They are not real thin like a lot of novelty socks are.  They are a medium weight.  I took photos of the edge of the socks so you can see the thickness. Good for a man or a woman.  Very cute.",1
5,"This is a sweet cap, perfect for keeping warm. Also great for bad hair days. It comes in other colors too.",1
3,Stitching isn‚Äôt holding up as I expected.  I have had to repair it twice.,0
5,"This dress is great, especially for people with large upper arms. I'm 5.6, 210 lbs, bust 40C. I ordered the XL. The body of this dress is loose, but not extremely loose. It's just right. I like this dress so much. I ordered it in every color.",1
5,"This dress is very beautiful. The quality is high compared to the price. The material is very flowy and perfect for warmer days. The top part fits small, you'd want to size up. A bra is not needed because the top is fitted enough to hold breasts in place. Every time I wear it I get tons of compliments!",1
3,It‚Äôs super cute but no pockets and the fabric isn‚Äôt absorbent. This definitely more for show than function and it‚Äôs cute enough that I don‚Äôt care.,0
1,"Arrived broken.  Very disappointed beause it's a really cute belt.  The color is nice, but it just fell apart when I took it out of the bag.",0
5,The best masks I‚Äôve bought ! The elastic is adjustable so you can get a snug fit. They are comfortable to wear and have a nose wire so you can fit the mask over your nose to prevent your glasses from fogging. The mask also has a slot on the inside for additional filters. Well made!,1
5,"Arrived on time and was just what I wanted! Perfect to cover a tank top in the summer for those that aren't comfortable with wearing just that out. The quality is great, I haven't had any issues at all.",1
4,Looks to be well made. Has a firm brim.  Did come with a crease down middle from being folded in half.  Large fits my  adult head.  The bottom is gathered by elastic so it is snug.,1
3,"Product is ok, but smell is very bad. Smells like smoke. Had to air it out. Thank you febreeze!",0
1,"The sides of these pants have adjustable grommets that allow for you to make the pants any size you want, no belt needed. (Thank god, that's why they have no belt loops.) After two months, the grommets on both sides tore out of the pants. Pulled right through and no 'event' caused it to happen. Pulled on the pants, adjustment ripped right through the fabric. Noe they fit like a pair of too-loose sweat pants with no string.<br />Contacted ScotteVest, they said yep, they are covered for 24 months. HOWEVER, if you bought them from Amazon, you have to return them to Amazon. So far, after 3 weeks and 3 emails, Ive got NOTHING back from Amazon.<br />Dont buy these pants. And whatever you do, DONT BUY THEM FROM AMAZON.",0
5,Going to be a great gift for my sons girlfriend who is s writer,1

4,Good.,1
5,"Cool colors, just don't wear acrylic socks on a factory floor for 9 hours and expect to be fresh",1
5,"This shirt was perfect.  Fabric is soft and I love the tie in the front. I am 5' 6"" and weight 190. I bought an XL .",1
5,Very good,1
4,They are just the right size!,1
1,"Stretch pants, advertised as 88% nylon, 12 % spandex, were more like parachute material instead of stretch.  My Wranglers, 96% nylon, 4 % spandex, are more flexible than these... and 1/3 cheaper. The sizing chart said size 34 would fit waist 34"" to 36"" which they do not.",0
4,"This dress has is very cute!  I love the cut and pattern. the main thing I don‚Äôt like is the fabric kind of feels like swimsuit material- slick and stretchy, but it still flows nicely. I was just expecting more of a light flowy fabric. I am 4‚Äô11‚Äù so I definitely need to hem it and maybe cut the slits up higher. I am a 32B and it fits my chest well because it‚Äôs so stretchy and the back and straps are adjustable. It is very open back on me which is what I wanted. Overall great dress, I‚Äôm happy with it.",1
2,Runs small,0
2,This band pinches me often and the magnets slide. Not what I was expecting at all.,0
1,"Not good, the lenses never went back to clear.<br />The lenses stayed tinted after coming back inside.<br />Even after days on my desk in the house they are still tinted<br />I would not recommend",0
3,didn't fit as expected,0
4,Too small. Need a large but unavailable on Amazon.,1
3,"Narrow, run small, fingers are far too long and there is minimal flexibility in these gloves. I‚Äôm a pretty big guy (6‚Äô1‚Äù 225 pound weightlifter) and I would need a XXXL for anywhere near a comfortable fit. I used the sizing chart and it‚Äôs a waste of time - my hands are 9.25 inches around according to the chart  the XL souls fit me - not even close. For $8 I‚Äôll keep them but they are hard to get on my hands - better suited for women or guys with small hands. There‚Äôs a joke here but I‚Äôll pass.<br /><br />Bottom line is that If you have small hands, order 1-2 sizes larger and if you have big hands, keep looking for a better sized pair of gloves. They do work on touch screen phones but they are so stiff it‚Äôs hard to have any dexterity when using a phone.",0
5,"I'm 5'-8&#34;, 160, 31&#34; waist, with a fit, slim (but not very muscular) build - and the Medium size is tailored exceptionally well for my own frame. They don't bind, they travel well when I stretch and move, the fabric feels exceptionally luxurious, breathable and high-quality, the tailoring and construction is flawless, and the overall form-fitting effect is downright more flattering than I deserve. So I'm buying a second set (one for casual wear, one for athletics). Perfect.",1
1,I only received 3 of the 6 pairs?,0
5,"Graphics, fit, no sunburn dome!",1
5,"Really soft and fit well, Thank you",1
3,Length is wonderful but it is tight on the chest. When on is slightly see through on chest. Colors not like orig pac man.,0
4,very comfy..i like it but it seems as if its stripping already,1
4,"I don't think it gets that cold in florida for my son to wear the hat, but we both like the regular show and we haven't seen any other kids with it so we like it.",1
1,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews about the fit. You would need to order 2 to 3 sizes above your normal size. Even with the size chart, it just does not fit, not even close. The material also has zero give or stretch, I don't think ordering this skirt is worth it. Who wants a clothing item in their wardrobe that is 3 sizes over their actual size? I particularly don't. I like ordering my size and it fitting me, just like my other garments of that same size. This seller should absolutely remarket this skirt towards actual little girls, not really a Womens clothing item. It's cute but I wouldn't buy it again or suggest a friend buy it and am actually returning it.",0
5,Really great replicas of Dior So Real Even the colored nosepiece!,1
5,like it for vacation,1
3,The colors are not like the pictures. they are to big. the do look warm but i have to wait for my baby to grow into them.,0
3,Cute but small,0
4,The bag is functional and I higher quality than I could get locally. I am satisfied that it will do just what inneed it to do.,1
2,The necklace is cheap. The pictures make the books look 3D as if u could touch/feel each book. This is not the case. It is just a picture of books with an acrylic type material over it.,0
4,Elegant shirt. Satisfied with order,1
3,Very see through! I like it. Small chest (size B cup/30 in) big hips (34 in). It is cute. I don't see how it could be a dress but that is just my preference but it is very see through in im getting something to wear under it. Worth to buy.,0
4,"Pros:<br />Durable fine linked metal band with strong magnetic catch.  Should outlast the fitbit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Matte coating begins wearing off in a few days, leaving an irregular shiny and matte finish.",1

4,Not for tall girls,1
5,I love these.  Subtle and flashy at the same time.,1
5,"I've been buying and enjoying the inexpensive readers-in-a-tube from my local hardware store for many years. These are a little more expensive, but worth the cost. These have spring-loaded arms like my previous readers, but upgrade to fixed, swivel nose-pieces that won't slide off and the lenses seem slightly higher in quality. These appear to be more scratch resistant than my previous go-to's . I will be stocking up on these.",1
5,"A must have for any die hard football fan. After washing, it still has great graphics and color. If you want to turn some heads, get this shirt.",1
5,Absolutely wonderful feel and weight. Cozy. It was just too big for me.,1

2,"The two stars are based on the faulty product information. I purchased several of these bags to fit a specific space in a car roof carrier.  As soon as I saw them, I knew they were NOT 18 inches.  Measured from end to end they were only 15 inches. That is a substantial discrepancy. I can't comment on the quality of the bags because I'm returning them.",0
5,Was a perfect Halloween costume!,1

4,"Daughter loves these, unfortunately they run big, and there are no 1/2 sizes, or just straight sizing. Wish they would make a size 1, not 13/1, or a 2, not a 2/3. But very cute!",1
4,"I like this dress, not the material too much but it doesn't matter because it is a small cut, so it doesn't fit and will be gifted. Design and colour are great, but fit is not for anyone who wears beyond a size ten.",1
2,I ordered a 2xl and it fit like a medium...the fit was way off and not as I expected,0
5,"Im 5'1 and the dress fit right at my ankles. I can wear this with flat sandals without having to worry about tripping, and hitting my face on the ground. Ive gotten a TON of compliments, and decided to purchase in the blush pink (I think it says light lavender on here).",1

1,Fit like diapers. Huge. I do not recommend.,0
5,"I have loved my 3 pack of reading glasses , they are exactly what I expected and I get compliments every day that I wear them!",1
5,My wife loves it,1
5,I love casio watches. They are so durable and the functions are easy for any user. I wear a casio watch every day!,1
1,Super cheaply made. Not at all what was displayed in images.  I could have bought these from the dollar tree for $1,0
5,Pretty good on time üòäüòäüòä,1
5,"Loved the dress. It was beautiful, but it doesn't run true to size.  RUNS VERY SMALL!!! Sent it back!!",1
4,I'm 5'4 and 135 pounds. I bought a med. Because they were out off small. I had to get it altered. It was WAY too long and a little big around the arms. Other than that the dress was lovely. I felt great in it.,1
3,"Material, color and style are great. I ordered a Med however it was way too small. I would purchase this again but would go up a size.",0
2,"The blouse is cute, but the lace on bottom that goes around hips...is uneven. It is longer on the front left side of the blouse.",0
2,"Size was slightly small, fabric is stiff and super wrinkly, which together makes it ugly and uncomfortable.  Color is very pale, not like the photo.  Would not reccomend",0
5,Given as a gift.  He's very happy with them.,1
5,Fit fine,1
2,"I got this for my step daughter for her 3rd birthday party. The top fit well and she could wear it again if she wanted, but the bottoms started to fall apart after only wearing it for about 3 hours. It's just tulle with a very large ribbon - not as cute as in the picture. It worked for what we used it for, but I would never pay that much for this outfit again.",0
1,Mine arrived all damaged such a shame. I had a daniel tiger theme for my sons bday party.,0
1,Love the color zipper broke within the first few days,0
5,Love them they are beautiful came is a super cute sail boat bag great for a gift.,1
1,way to small for xl,0
5,"This dress flares out a little at the hips which can make me feel a little heavier than I am, but it doesn't bother me enough to not wear it. Other than that, the overall fit is as expected and is a good quality. This falls just above my knees by a few inches (I'm 5'7""), so if you're looking for something to cover your knees you may need to wear leggings under it.",1
5,Ordered wrong size,1
5,Great looking watch.,1
5,I get tons of complements on this outfit. I paired it with grey leggings and brown boots for fall.,1
5,This is a medium. 130 pounds,1
2,felt like i had a sock in my face... to stuffy to breathe,0
4,The dress was a bit long for me and I washed it and it looks like crap now but it was a beautiful dress that I wore once. üòî,1
3,"They were beautiful, however, they turned my fingers green and roasted easily",0
5,"This sweater is great! I ordered an XXL and it fits my 6'2"" son perfectly.  He likes it just a little loose and this size works great.  It is so soft and smooth, not like a regular sweater or sweatshirt. The material doesn't shrink either.",1
1,These were made horribly. The sizing is true - but the fabric is that of cheap kids PJ's. Not worth it.,0
3,"Would be a good suit if your butt and boobs are a similar size. The suit fit the bottoms, but was huge on the top. Otherwise, it's just like the picture. Nice quality.",0
3,I ordered up one size and it fit perfectly.  The material is a bit sheer so you‚Äôd have to wear a slip underneath unless you don‚Äôt mind.,0
5,This is a wonderfully colorful bag with nice long adjustable strap and lined in pink on the inside.  The pockets are lined and deep so that you can pack it full!,1
1,This is the second pair ive recieved. They are actually a replacement pair because the first pair was scratched. And these were in fact scratched as well. No more replacements just want a refund no.,0
5,Exactly as advertised.  Nice if they had full large finger rings too.,1
2,"Purchased for my daughter's Christmas program.  The fit was fine.  But after 2 hours of standing, she complained her feet hurt and could barely walk.  Returned.",0
5,Perfect for a spring morning,1
4,Smaller than I thought but good.,1
1,I bought a black and champagne handbag back in January.  I saved the champagne one for the summer and only started using it in July.  Yesterday I noticed that the stitching holding the handle in place was just about to come off (pic attached) and the handle on the other side (the material is starting to rip).  Well this didn't last long - 3 months.  Very disappointed as I really liked this handbag.  Guess I better check out the black one that I used from Feb through June and see if the same thing is happening with that one.  3 months is not worth the price.,0
1,This is not an adult skirt. I bought it for a tutu party and it was way to small seriously it didn't even fit my two year old cousin. It was mad for like a doll,0
4,"I love 2 piece outfits because they are so easy to put together. The color is not identical to the pictures but it‚Äô close enough. The material is thin, breathable for summer, not too see through, the long shirt helps. I personally didn‚Äôt love the length of the shorts, I‚Äôm shorter so the shorts look longer. I adjusted the length of the shorts and it looks so much better.",1
3,"These bracelets are cute, but do appear to be on the cheap side.  The coloring isn‚Äôt quite gold, but isn‚Äôt bad.  They are lightweight and definitely run smaller than the stated size.  I was able to get them on and they were cute, but I cannot speak to value for money since no price is showing at the time of this review.  I don‚Äôt think these would hold up to long time wear, but as cute, costume jewelry, they work.",0
5,"I love this bag!  To me, It looks just as pictured. The price is wonderful and I love the fact that it is big and roomy. I love all the pockets and hopefully this will mean I can keep it organized. (giggle)  For folks who are concerned about the size of the bag, there are measurements listed in the discription, and also with the seller's photos. I would suggest that before you waste time, effort and your hard earned money ordering a bag that is &#34;just too big&#34;, you get out a measuring tape and get a better idea of the size. That's what I did, and the size of the bag was exactly as I expected. Hope this review helps you when deciding on this bag.",1
1,"This looks way different than the pic... the black sleeves & black at the bottom side, NO. it's all the tie die look. Disappointed cuz I bought an all tie die one too, so now I have 2 identical shirts. I am not happy about that at all.",0
2,The picture with Santa in front of the tree shows a nice plush suit.  The one they actually sent is thin see through material with an overly large neck hole and this suit is essentially a TShirt with some white fluff down the middle and on the sleeves.  The pants are shorts.  Its not worth any money.,0
2,I was so sad.,0
4,nice shoes very comfortable and priced right,1
3,"The shape of the sweater was not flattering. I am hourglass shaped, 34 C bra, flat toned waist and slightly muscular arms. My shoulders are normal not too broad. If you look at the model picture you will see that the arms are short and droopy, meaning the sleeves starts well beneath the shoulder line. I typically do not like when the sleeve line starts mid upper arms because it makes the shoulders and upper arms appear wide. I purchased a small as usual and it fit fine but I did not like the shape, it made my upper arms looks fat. It also flattened my breasts. My recommendation for a sweater with this weird shape is to make it be oversized so go up a size or two. So I will be returning it. The actual sweater was fine not itchy, not see through, medium thickness and a combo of white and black threads.  Was super cheap and  ran true to size but decide for yourself if the shape is for you. my guess is this would probably be best for a busty woman with narrow shoulders.Bottom line its a decent sweater that's super cheap (&#62;$5)  just not for me",0
5,Nice case love the inside. Outside too.,1
1,Ordered a size 13 junior and couldn‚Äôt even get them up over my hips.<br /> Seller promptly refunded my money.,0
1,These shirts are THIN!!!  I could see my bra through the waffle weave material. Trashy!  I was not impressed and returned both styles of shirt I purchased.,0
5,I like this dress so much I'm getting another one in a different pattern.,1
5,I love this dress‚ô° will be ordering more!,1
5,"I love the colors and patterns of the socks.  They fit well and are comfortable.  I use them in the house to keep my feet warm.  They are thick enough for household wear.  I doubt if I would wear them in shoes, my intent was for something to wear around the house.",1
3,"These are just ok, acceptable for the price. The waistband is uncomfortable and definitely creates a bulge. They are slightly transparent when bending over. Then again, they are considered one size and I'm probably at the larger end of that spectrum (thanks, kids!).<br />They are very soft & comfortable. Good for lounging around the house.",0
3,"Good quality, but VERY small. I went up two sizes and still couldn't fit into it.",0
4,super cute and girly,1
3,Not the best quality when I wear them the tongue shifts constantly all the way to the back of my shoe but for the most part they get the job done.,0
3,"I bought them as gym and workout shorts. I find them to be true to size and light weight; however, they are not comfortable because they bunch up. You have to continuously pull and tug at them. I won‚Äôt be wearing them back to the gym.",0
2,Whelp it‚Äôs broken already. The bee fell of and I lost It. That was a waste. So annoyed.,0
5,Item Returned.,1
5,I really like these pajamas. They are very comfortable and soft I highly recommend.,1
5,"Smooth transaction. Fast shipping, I got just what was pictured. All around happy!",1
2,Cute but cheaply made. Looks like a Halloween costume.,0
5,I bought them for a funeral.  We liked them.,1
5,"I loved these so much I ordered another set to give out as gifts. The gold chains are cheap, cheap, cheap, but the silver ones are ok. I put the stones on my real silver or gold necklaces do it did not matter. I get a lot of compliments,  especially when I wear the amethyst.",1
5,I love eat cuffs. When I saw and ear piercing made for a cartilage cuff I knew I had to get it. The hoop was okay but knock it one good time the ball fell out and you're stuck with a hoop without a ball.,1
1,Didn't like it and seller didn't want to pay shipping so took 1/2 off the item I wanted to return it! Will never wear it.,0
5,Bought this for a tweed style crop jacket to give it a designer look! It‚Äôs a great pin!,1
2,"Loved the color on me. Too long: I am 5‚Äô 1‚Äù. If the white material also had some stretch, the fit would be better. I need to return",0
1,"Very flimsy, wouldn't trust to stay in place",0
1,Zippered already broke omg!!!,0
4,Biught for our trip to the beach. Worked out great. Only dislike would be they are tinted. The kids didn't like that very much.,1
5,"Excellent quality, affordable and definitely worth it! These earrings are as described/listed.<br /><br />These earrings are very subtle yet sparkly, lightweight, sterling silver, very comfortable and most importantly it doesn't itch! (I have sensitive ears as well)<br /><br />They make a great gift for all ages!<br /><br />Another excellent product from Jewlpire!",1
2,"Elastic inside a waistband not as wide, as it should be. What the point?!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0
2,I am returning this.  I wish it was heavier and it just didn't fit as I thought it would.  Not flattering on me.  The material is very light and I truly wasn't happy with the quality.,0
4,"These are good for my 6 year old. You get what you pay for. They look and feel cheap. For the price, though, high quality is not to be expected. I would recommend for children or as part of a costume, but not for an adult to wear every day.",1
5,"I was looking for bottoms for my son, a tall 7 yr-old whose pants always look like ‚Äúclam diggers‚Äù. I tried every brand possible, either the size 7 was too short, or size 8 fell off his waist. Until I found this brand! It is definitely in the large size, but is also long, which helps my case. My son loves how comfy they feel, and there is room to grown into. Buying more!",1
3,"Not much arch support. And that is why purchased them,  I have fallen arches I will have to use arch support inserts",0
5,"These are well made and comfortable yoga pants.  The higher than usual waist line does a great job of holding in a tummy.  The fabric is soft, comfortable to wear but also thick enough to not be revealing.",1
5,Love it,1
2,The lights didn't work in one of the shoes. Works fine on one shoe.,0
4,"Perfet winter sweater. I  Wear it with dress pants or casual pants or even with pair of jeans, just looks perfect. Just hope the lints wont come though.",1
5,"This skirt is super cute, the headband is a plus. It fit well. My daughter is slim and small for her size but the exact size she wears 6 fit perfectly",1
1,I ordered these and got high tops instead of regular shoes like in the picture. They also are about an inch to large,0
5,These reading glasses are lightweight and I use them for the middle distance between the end of my nose and my laptop screen. I keep a pair in every room where I will likely need to use them and don't have to go searching for my glasses just to read the back of a package of pasta or a receipt or a phone number.,1
3,"Like purse. Received lots of comments and complements, but starting to fray already after a short time of use. Other than that good purchase.",0
3,thought it would be a bright white.  It was a stretch material...thought it would be more cotton.  It hung very well though,0
1,Its very small around my breasts.  Seems like the bottoms are more true to fit than the top,0
1,This thing doesn‚Äôt cover anything. Kinda defeats the purpose!,0
5,"These are just a bit wide for my face, otherwise, they are great if you need a photochromatic lens.<br /><br />The lenses cover a wide field of view and the color change is rapid compared to most other photochromatic lenses that I've had.<br /><br />The arms fit nice and tight, and the nose bridge, while not the most comfortable I've ever worn, is fully adjustable.<br /><br />The arms are connected with spring hinges, something I demand on all of my sunglasses now.<br /><br />For plastic lenses, these are very, very clear and clean with no distortion that I could discern and the polarization works very well.<br /><br />I only wish that they were a bit more narrow to fit my face better but, other than that they are a very good pair of glasses, especially at this price point.<br /><br />Review of: WZERRY Photochromic Polarized Sunglasses for Men",1
2,"It's pretty, but when I received it - I found that it was also of a plastic substance and I was very disappointed.  I don't know if I will wear it at all.",0
1,I am super disappointed in this product. What I received did not look like the picture at all and one of the backs to the pin doesn‚Äôt lock so it fell off as soon as I put it on and won‚Äôt stay. I would not buy this again.,0
2,It is large - which is okay.  It is very boxy - which is okay.  But the fabric is horrid!  Like dollar store fabric.,0
3,"I am very short and from advertisement expected the top to be much longer.  Also, I ordered the aqua and received white.",0
3,"This chain is super, super fine, so don't expect much bling.  The tiny ball stations are faceted, but they are so tiny you can't even hardly see the chain on you when you're wearing it.  If I had seen it in person I would not have purchased, but it is okay.",0
5,Perfect,1
5,Cute and I love the higher neckline,1
3,"Cheaper looking than I expected, but still looks good on the inside of it.",0
3,"Like the graphics, but printed on a cheap & thin fruit o' loom shirt and runs small, probably wont fit after it is washed.  Not worth the price charged in my opinion.",0
5,Very useful product.,1
4,Pretty true to size I can wear a 10-12 in most brands but I got a large. Love the fit and looks great.,1
3,"nice shoes, but these seem very big for their stated size.",0
2,"i got this for a friend, it really was not what I was looking for , but could not find it,  what I WANTED  was a night shirt that said  ""I dont care who dies in the movie as long as the dog lives,  ""  It is in t shirts but I want it in a night shirt",0
1,"Looks very cheap, smells horrible. Do not waste your money !",0
1,"Much too short waisted, poor quality construction and fabric.",0
1,"This dress is absolutely ridiculous. It feels like costume material and the bottom is just holes cut out of the fabric, it was already fraying right out of the package. It doesn't look anything like what's pictured, I'm sending it right back and not ordering ANYTHING from this seller again.",0
4,Great organizer but the phone shaped pockets are a little too small for phones these days.,1
2,"This pendant is large and sparkly, but not in a good way.  It is cheap looking.  I will only wear it for St. Patrick's Day.",0
1,3rd party trying to return it.too small!!need label too return this please help!,0
3,Beautiful bag but I don‚Äôt think the one I received is authentic. The style number doesn‚Äôt match the Taylor Tote it matches a men‚Äôs brief case.,0
4,"They work great for white balls but not so much for colored balls. We‚Äôve had good luck finding balls.<br /><br />This isn‚Äôt a fault of product, but white flowers like clover look just like balls, as does cottonwood seeds.",1
5,Awesome  material and good in thickness,1
1,"Runs very small. The emerald I ordered isn‚Äôt really emerald.... more like an olive green. It fits, but it‚Äôs rather tight. Definitely size up x 2!",0
5,I have the matching necklace,1
5,"The skirt's color is beautiful, the fabric is very soft and comfortable. The length is perfect too. I can't say anything negative about this product. I had to return it because I don't like skirts to be very fit to my body (I have a big butt loool). I was so sad actually to return it, but I had to. It will fit more slim girls.",1
5,"I love the fabric and the cut of these. They are too big in the waist for me, and if I reorder, I'm going to go down a size. I ordered a 2x (normally a 16/18) but definitely could have made an XL work for me!",1
1,"Don‚Äôt buy this , the reviews are misleading. This vest has a chemical smell to the point it is worrisome.",0
1,This item was not as shown or described!  I returned it... no buttons or pleats at all on it.,0
2,"Very poorly made. Strings hanging, one arm hole different from the other, and too sheer for me. I returned.",0
4,My loves it very much and started wearing it right away. It feels durable and looks well made,1
4,"The material is actually pretty cozy, but definitely order a size up, the crotch Inseam is a little too short. I'm not thrilled but it'll work",1
1,its built for large hour glass figures. I was not impressed.,0
5,Slimey made the socks even better.,1
2,This dress is cute but arrived with a broken strap (plastic clip connecting strap to dress is missing). I had ordered it for a vacation I'm going on this weekend and tried to order another one to exchange to receive before I leave town Friday but it's not available so I will be returning the dress.,0
3,It was really cute and the right size for my nose. Only thing is that the silver became pink after a few uses. Really would have loved it if it hadn't oxidized so quickly.,0
1,Extremely thin and coarse material. It is similar to the fabric swatches from Joann‚Äôs.  I ordered an XL but it is definitely the size of a medium.,0
2,"Oh dear lord, this was incredibly see-through. Even spanx we‚Äôre really noticeable through this material",0
1,"The little ball on the end of the part that actually goes in and out of the belt hole is made out of plastic and ripped off the very first time I went to the bathroom and removed this belt: I told the seller and they sent another quickly. However, the product unfortunately is just cheap and bad. It broke again, do not reccommend and will never buy another myself.",0
2,It is very cheap material. Fortunately the company gave me my money back.,0
3,This is a cute shirt but i wish the sizes were acually what they are labeled as!,0
2,"Meh, they worked for a skit we had planned, but the quality really isn't great at all. Not sure I would purchase the same ones again.",0
5,Nice,1
5,Good texture and product quality is good.,1
4,Did not realize they were (sun) readers so I haven‚Äôt used them,1
5,"I am obsessed with this relax straight fit jean that literally is the perfect fit all around! Love the length, way it hugs my butt and hips, rise, and amount of distress details. Super comfortable and flattering all around. I ended up ordering a 2nd pair!",1
3,It's extremely see through and runs kind of small,0
5,Better than expected. I get lots of compliments on these.,1
2,"Really cute necklace, but rusted a week after I received it. It's light, cheap material but it still looks cute.",0
3,This runs small by about 2 sizes. And the fabric is super thin.,0
2,"The multi colored skull scrub/working cap is humongous.  The material is soft, silky and a tad too shiny for my liking.  The buttons are placed too far back to utilize for wearing a mask.  Unfortunately, unhappy with my purchase.",0
1,When we received the product over half did not work very disappointed was for my grandsons now after the build up I gave them they feel let down sorry I cannot endorse your product,0
5,Love the details of this pin. It's lovely.,1
3,"I bought these for a masquerade birthday party. They were absolutely gorgeous and very dainty. These are not plastic, they are like a thick lace/cloth material. Unfortunately the ribbon that ties at the back of your head broke right off of two different masks. Luckily, the birthday girl and other guests were cool about it and we made it by with scotch tape.",0
2,I wanted to like it but the large on me was so tight! And I'm a skinny girl! Had to get rid of it because I washed it before I tried it on.. The sad part I bought two..,0
4,Nice beach shoe.  Found it to be a size too big,1
5,It was even better than expected. Looked amazing and I got so many compliments,1
5,I just them for a baking class and the kids at my job loved them,1
2,the end holds were just too tiny,0
5,Perfect baby shower favors!,1
5,good,1
5,"Just as pictured! Wore to an early spring wedding and it looked great! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 140lbs and I purchased a Large for length. A medium would have fit fine, but I didn‚Äôt feel the Large was too large.",1
3,The case was broken but the watch was not broken.  It is a birthday gift for my niece.,0
3,The shoes are really cute and my 3 yr old nephew thought they were cool. The charger cord that came with them is split so you can charge both shoes at once but one side of ours doesn't work so we will have to charge 1 shoe at a time.  I think that will get annoying and we'll probably end up just not using the lights.,0
5,I really love the soft stretchy material.  It's very flattering.,1
1,"Too small, thin, lekay.",0
2,"The arm holes are so big your girl stuff hangs out.  By the time I put it on, it was too late to send back.",0
5,"i am wearing it now, i live on the outer banks of n.c. have to check on this hurricane, shark bait",1
5,"I‚Äôve had mine for a few months now I‚Äôm a active technician and mechanic, I‚Äôve had my hand completely soaked in gasoline with the American flag ring with no issues or damage to it. Very happy I was skeptical at first with all the mixed reviews but for the price you can‚Äôt beat these!",1
5,Gift for a friend,1
5,well made and cute,1
4,I thought the top could have been a little longer,1
5,Love it,1
5,I wanted my grandson to have a good Christmas and he did.,1
1,Doesn't have pleats and was way too small for a size 14,0
1,"The fit is terrible and it's cheaply made, with very thin fabric. Tried it on, looked so bad, removed it and put it in the donate bag.",0
4,Overall good glasses for the price.,1
2,Nice quality but this fit more like a kid size. Decent price for a set. It‚Äôs a nice order but just not for me.,0
3,"[[VIDEOID:d829f8190ec0ae2be353f1d1ac619c94]] The style is in now. It makes the outfit. Piece in the pic came a part prior to train stop pic but reassembled it. Overall, happy with the product.",0
5,Fantastic.,1
5,I love these new brown wayfarers. Super comfortable and very stylish. I've had several compliments since I bought them. I particularly like the tortoise-shell frame. Beautifully crafted. Thank you Eye Love for another high-quality product. You never disappoint.,1
3,Honestly I liked this. The only thing is that the chain is a kinda cheap looking. Honesty my sister still liked them but.,0
5,beautiful,1
2,"Flimsy material, made for inexpensive watches. Fits only bands of small and medium widths, these measurements are not mentioned. Had to return because the watchband I had purchased this for (woman's) was actually too wide to fit in the tool.",0
1,My review is like the opposite of the other review lol. I searched for medium and the tag does say medium but the fit is like an extra large or large. I'm usually a medium. I'm 5ft 2inch 133lbs. I would have loved it if it actually fit because the material is very comfy. I would definitely recommend if you are taller! And a regularly size large,0
5,The color of the cap was vivid. The stitching was good. The cap had enough fabric to cover my entire cap wearing area. This item was a good value for the price. I would buy from this Seller again!,1
5,"We heat our house with wood, and have been through all kinds of firewood bags that don't last.  This is heavy duty, built to last. Holds a huge load and doesn't leave dust all over.  You'll never buy another bag for firewood.",1
2,"As much as I like these pj's. My 1 year old is obsessed with room on the broom and loves these pj's. He's 20 months and the 3t fits him. He's a, big boy at  34 pounds and 35 inches tall. My gripe is I've only washed these once with cold water and the color on the print is having and 2 of the letters in the words came off. The print is my real issue. I feel like spending so much money on a pair of pj's just to have the print (which is really what you pay for) is coming off after 1 wash. Not happy and wouldn't buy again.",0
5,"In India we used to carry Handkerchiefs always and every day,  covid bought us good habits back :)<br />the Handkerchiefs are worth carrying and help in day to day live if you have to go out.",1
2,"I wish the coat had a zipper vs buttons. The buttons are really loose. The coat however is so cute, and I like that the hood can be removed. Bright colors.",0
1,Won't cinch tight. ( Bad design 3 different ones same issue. Belt end frays and unravels won't stay right.,0
1,This item is not completely black as the picture suggests. The tulle is black however there is a long white fabric under the tulle that makes it look extremely tacky!!! Will not purchase from this line again. Very disappointed.,0
2,Ended up not using them because they looked like they would get stuck and rip luggage in an airport.  They would be good however for identifying equipment or carry on luggage.,0
3,Whoa.....this dress was huge!!!!!  Beautiful dress though.  I match my granddaughters measurements and weight.  Kept because she will eventually grow into it.,0
1,"This product is not as pictured! The front was fine but the back Aubie Logo coloring is off. It is only black and white and wouldn't look nearly as bad if the black and white where switch but definitely off and does not look like the photo represents. Pics attached. Undecided if I will keep. Also, I ordered a size L based off reviews and the large fits like a medium so definitely size up.",0
5,"Love the Amber tint. Comfy fit, sharp style. Winner!",1
5,"The hoops are great, look and feel like quality. The gift box is super impressive! A gift of be proud to give.",1
5,It‚Äôs so cute!! Arrived quickly and it‚Äôs comfy and adorable !!,1
3,Great dress bit I will have to return it,0
2,"I followed the chart and ordered a size up per the chart and all the recommendations and it was way too big in all areas. Material was ok, not sure if I would have kept it if it fit.",0
2,"Not a big fan. But, for the price I will probably just donate the item. Very thin material. Runs a little small",0
2,Bracelet loosened while wearing throughout the day. Disappointing.,0
1,Sizing is incorrect. Ordered large. Needed an XL,0
5,Comfortable,1
1,Not for plus size people .,0
5,"Was really impressed with how they lined up the design almost perfectly. The print came out high quality. It is made of jersey material, which I kind of expected for the price. Excited to flaunt this dope  #FameLadySquad shirt!",1
5,"Size 12.5 feet and they fit great, good heel support, solid compression up to knees, not to tight in the toe box area. I use them for both hiking/ ski touring and so far so good,",1
3,Too big,0
1,Nunca lleg√≥ y nunca recib√≠ el reembolso,0
5,"I normally wear a medium so I ordered an xxl and it fits.  I was very impressed with the quality of the fabric, expecting a thin cheap fabric.  Fabric is is very good quality and the shirt is made very well.",1
5,Good quality runs a little big,1
2,Much smaller than I thought they would be,0
3,I found these shoes to be stiff and kind of clunky.  I returned them.,0
5,"Absolutely LOVE this dress! It‚Äôs well made, great quality, and so flattering!<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and maybe 155 pounds, I prefer dresses that aren‚Äôt too tight as I feel they‚Äôre more flattering. Loved this dress as soon as I put it on. It‚Äôs midi length and has an elastic waist band that‚Äôs not too tight. The sleeves are balloon and look good long or slightly pushed up; the neckline can be tied in the front as a bow or the ties can be done in the back (have worn it both ways). This is definitely a dress I‚Äôll gravitate to for versatility. Dressed down with block sandals, dressed up with wedges.",1

5,"I have a few more cards to keep up with than most. This design really suits me as every card has a slot that makes it easy to find and retrieve. This billfold is more expensive than some on Amazon. Supple leather, quality stitching, and superior design make it well worth a few more bucks. Some of the less expensive wallets with similar design have card pockets that allow the card to slip down so far that they can not be easily retrieved. The dimensions of this wallet provide slightly more room for the card so it slips out more easily. At the same time the extra dimensions are small enough that the wallet is still easy to fit into a back, side or cargo pocket and retrieve without hanging. I'm very pleased.",1

2,"These are really comfortable, they are Not hard on the feet, so its not hard on your legs. I normally don't like anything memory foam but these are easier on my feet than allot of the more expensive slippers with the rubber soles. I wrote a different review when I purchased these, I've had to change it because I bought 2 pair and both lasted maybe a few months. The memory foam is Not real memory foam, it's just foam that takes the shape of your heel and eventually your heel sits in a hole it forms from walking on it. These are cheaply made and I thought they would be warm, well, they are not. My toes are freezing and I am usually always hot and hate for my feet to be too hot. Nope, not these. Toes are always cold. I miss the neighborhood Payless shoes. They always had the best slippers. I'm striking out on Amazon with slippers so I'm going to shop elsewhere. There are too many sellers from overseas on here now and even the Jessica Simpson slippers have terrible reviews and videos showing them falling apart after a few days! Read Allot of the reviews before you buy. There are so many more reviews on these products as of late because it's really infuriating spending all this money on shoes or slippers and they end up being garbage! Amazon needs to do better at filtering out these cheap sellers with terrible products! These slippers are Not worth the money. Save it and buy them elsewhere period. I've literally gone through about 7 pairs of slippers from Amazon this year! I'm going to buy from a store, even if online, it's going to be from a trusted store.",0

5,"My mother wore a Miraculous Medal every day, and everyday reciting the prayer engraved on the medal.  She recently passed at the tender age of 98, and I purchased this medal for my 18 year old daughter, who was extremely close to my mother.  I don't always, or more likely rarely, choose jewelry for my daughter that she likes.  I hit it out of the ballpark with this medal!  She really likes it, I know because she wears it often.  The lariat style is so unique, and it's the perfect delicate size that she likes.  It has the Sacred & Sorrowful Hearts and the Stars on the back, which was an imperative feature in my purchase of a Miraculous Medal.  It's a lovely medal.  If you're looking for a ""complete"" medal with the Hearts, etc. on the back, please consider this one. I highly recommend it, especially for the teen/young woman.",1
1,Very disappointed in the color. The picture shows a ruby reddish color almost see through. The Carnelian that came with my order is a dark brown and looks nothing like advertised.,0
2,It was to large,0
5,Bought this for my son for his cosplay . For the price the ring is good. I just wish the latch wouldn‚Äôt open so easily with hand movement.,1
4,Excellent product.,1
2,First of all I am 5'4 and about 190 and I am a 36C. The length was fine though it was a bit tight across the bust . I think it is made from a cotton blend that is a bit rough. I was disappointed that it wasn't softer and I just couldn't see myself dragging this over my head after a hot day at the beach.  I had ordered a couple of similar dresses for less from different manufacturers and they were soft and draped well.,0

1,I want to return this dress back. It‚Äôs  tight on my daughter.,0
2,"I ordered this key chain because it looked well made and I liked the colors.  When it came in, it was light weight, small, and not worth the 13.99 plus tax that I paid.  For the amount I paid you'd think it would have been Sterling Silver!  I didn't return it because my daughter wanted it for a charm (thats how small it is).",0
1,"These are very cheaply made. The glue that holds the pearl onto the metal extends past pearl and is visible on both earrings.  I thought I could ship it away but it is quite durable  Sadly, these earrings look cheap and I would not recommend!",0

1,"This luggage set is called &quot;lightweight spinner&quot;, and the name is ironically apt!!!  I used the largest piece for a domestic plane trip, and the suitcase was not up to the rigors of baggage handling associated with delivery onto the carousel.  The outer section cracked and is now unusable.  Other brands I've used and owned have never arrived DOA at my destination after being bounced around a bit.  Yes, the price may seem like a bargain.<br />It's really not such a bargain.  You are buying totally cheap and sub-par  --- junk luggage!",0
3,Nice product that has a manty feel.<br />If you want to make a little guy look bigger this is perfect.<br />They are probably the sexiest mens underwear available.,0
1,UPDATE: THE COMPANY KEEPS HARASSING TO DELETE MY REVIEW & THEY WILL PAY!!! Theres no compression on the lower belly area,0
2,Broke after I used it in 2 different pairs of shoes.  I'm still trying to use it and I think it is working but it is broken.I would look for an alternative if you haven't purchased one yet.,0

3,It‚Äôs more of a bright red when I was hoping for a darker color.,0
1,Jacket was perfect. Nice and firm fitting. The pants were big enough for two people.  Very strange proportions. I was not happy with this purchase at all.,0
3,"Sadly, these Lock Lace knock-offs are just mediocre.  There are two issues: 1) the cords are thinner & the have less resistance so your shoes fit more loosely, 2) the lock mechanisms are weak & won't always hold the laces in place.  It's too bad the real Lock Laces don't offer the dark gray color I wanted for my shoes.",0

1,"This dress doesn't meet the chart measurements.  It's way too large and the most disappointing thing is the colors are not as shown.  It's drab and dull.  The worst part is that although I can return the item, I have to pay shipping.  I do not recommend this seller or this dress.",0
5,Great quality dress.  Bought it as a swim cover up but ended up wearing it to a wedding!,1

5,"My husband loves this present. He thinks it's hilarious. The fit is great and the material is good quality, not super thin.",1
4,"I loved mine.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the studs aren't my type but I bought diamonds that I liked.  It didn't hurt at all,  it was more of the anticipation of doing it myself.  I ended up doing 2 more holes in my ears,  my nose, and redid my son's one ear in the last 15 mins",1
1,"First off the picture of this item looks identical to the IXIMO Lantern Pant Styl poduct line so I thought they would be similar, They're Absolutely Not! The fabric is Totally different, very thin and Much cheaper! These are Nothing like the picture! Also, the sizing is so off there's really no words to describe it! Just know that a 3XL is an American size medium-large in the Waist and it's definitely meant for somebody under 5 foot 5 inches. Not to mention, like other reviews have said, they are poorly made but most of that has to do with the cheap fabric! These are basically a knock off of another chinese-made product that is actually amazing!<br />The IXIMO Lantern pants product are awesome! The IXIMO pants look exactly like the picture! If you're looking for these kind of pants, I honestly can't recommend the IXIMO product enough! Just Do Not Buy this product!",0
3,"I like the look and they are comfortable if lounging, but be forewarned they're very thin. Cannot use comfortably in boots and would not be good for running or longer waks in athletic shoes. These would probably be fine with dress shoes (but I don't wear dress shoes). Description of product should be more upfront about the thickness... Half as thick as a regular crew sock.",0
5,"Very lightweight and comfortable shorts. Perfect length, zero complaints.",1
5,"the rose is made our of plastic, yet still looks pretty. I really like it and wear it often, the rose is cream colored and the chain is nice and long. I love it and it is a great and cheap way to make a statement. it arrived before the due date.",1
5,Perfect,1
2,"Although this boot for true to size (I got it in the mail today) it is absolutely not the same boot in the picture! Which I searched very hard for a specific boot that was NOT all shiny. This boot is all shiny, it does not have the dull color on the top like this picture shows. So I will be giving it 2 stars for the fact that they sent a product that isn‚Äôt like the picture!",0
1,"I have only worn these socks a handful of times and each time it is extremely uncomfortable and ripped. They were not made for larger people; my thighs pour over them, the roll down when you sit down (had to buy garters), the anti-slip band just has plastic dots inside. I should have realized these wouldn't work when the only model wearing them is tiny. If it was medically necessary I wouldn't wear them ever again, can't wait to get replacements",0

3,"I have a pretty big head, but maybe it's my face that's thin? I don't know, but these masks didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The best story I can tell to signify my lack of desire for this mask is this.  I had three masks in my car when I went to the office recently. One was a regular cotton mask that is boring looking, but gets the job done. Another was a cool black mask that fits and is pretty effective, but I have trouble breathing and talking with it on.<br /><br />The third was this one. I wore the blue one and knew right away it was going to be problematic. It doesn't seem to really be covering the face because it tries too hard with the nose area down to under the mouth. It was like I was a puppet in that when I exhaled, the mask expanded and when I inhaled it came up against my face. It also continued to slip down off my nose because of how loose it was and how it was far from a form fit.<br /><br />I would suggest that if a company is going to make form fitting masks that they take a bit more time in doing so. Otherwise, there's no reason for anything except a cotton-type face covering that goes ""all in"" on covering the mouth and nose.<br /><br />I am concerned by many of the masks I see because if we're going to do it with masks in public, we need to do it right. This, to me, is not quite doing it right.",0
5,This is a great beach cover up. The fabric starts our a little bit stiff but loosens right up after some wear. Wish there were more colors! Super cute!,1
1,TOO BIG!!!!!!!,0
4,These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I will say that they are on the heavier side for earrings so I'd more than likely only wear them for events and maybe date nights.,1
3,"Well constructed, diopter is correct.  However they did not darken at all. I put them in the freezer like one purchaser suggested. We will see. Definitely a better pair of glasses than the 5 pair for 15 dollars. Although I purchased them thinking they darken. Hmmmm",0
5,Cute addition for any purse or backpack!,1
4,This dress is very cute and wore well.  The heavy cotton fabric was able to stretch where I needed it to but do follow the vendor's size chart.  It did require a lot of ironing but stood up to a long day in the car and at the outdoor public event for which it was purchased.,1
2,The Zipper ripped in the first two hours of traveling with it.,0
3,Runs true to size. I followed some reviews that said order a size up and that was a big mistake. The point of this shirt is to fit snug and hug the child's body. My 3 YO is swimming in the large and he's 95 percentile for height and weight. Big kid.,0
5,I LOVE these! Very lightweight and comfortable.,1
2,I liked the suit but the zipper quality was poor. I had to take the sauna suit to the tailor shop get the zipper replaced with a much better zipper.,0

5,"I love this tank top. It‚Äôs classy, & isn‚Äôt see through.",1
1,"This looked like the perfect waterproof wallet for vacation.  It arrived and looks exactly like pictured however there was a brightly colored slip of paper in the packaging.  This note was a notice that the wallet was &#34;waterproof&#34; unless submerged for any &#34;length of time&#34;.  No details or guidelines to how waterproof it is exactly, just enough of a legal note to ensure I don't want to put anything I want to keep dry in it.  Packaged it back up and returned it.",0
5,Great looks exactly like picture!,1
1,Although it fit I ordered a size up based on comments. So it fit fine. However they designed without adjusting for a bigger girl. It shows near the arm bobage and the width of the bands are the exact same size as a small fit so it looks tacky like a thin strip across a wide arm. Very unflattering especially when your shooting for elegance which is what this dress is. My return experience has been excellent so thankful they are good that way and when receiving them was on time.,0
3,I like the color and it fit me well. I have wider hips and am 5‚Äô8.5‚Äù with no issues with sleeve length or fitting over my hips to zip. A few  things I disliked were: the multiple loose strings at seems and buttons. the hood doesn‚Äôt stay up if any wind and it sits funny on the color. The material is quite wrinkled and will need a steamer. I did enjoy it overall though and it traveled with me for my flights quite well. It was expected for the low price,0
4,I find these very nice. Soft and fairly sturdy for a silk shirt. The color was as I wanted the size was good (maybe just a little longer. I found nothing to complain about.,1
5,It's good quality. It fits my needs very well. Good buy. This review is from someone who has pretty high standards...just for reference.,1
1,"Literally a polyester sack. Horrible feel, no shape, cheap looking overall.",0

4,"Stylish watch for sure. I love it! It's comfortable and I like the simplicity of it and design. The only problem I had at first is you have to be out in the sun with it for a while to ""charge"" the luminous dials before you can see them at night. I thought that sucked for the money paid.",1

The band is leather and well-made, and the entire watch including case, crystal, face, hands and crown are well done and look nice.  The seconds hand does not line up exactly with the minutes marks, but this is a small matter than most people would not notice nor care about.  The quartz movement is accurate.  At $19.99 shipped at the time of our purchase, this is a lot of watch for the money.  Overall thumbs up.",1

4,"I would of given them a 5 star, only they flip a little on the heel.  I do wear them with a light sock. They are so light and comfortable. Very easy to clean. I bought them, with the help of others, who answered my question, if I could wear them in the garden. This is my second pair, I liked then so much. I like them better than my sneakers. I wear them running to the store, gardening and just because.",1
5,"Love this purse! It has two zipper pockets (one on the inside and one on the outside). Cheetah print fabric on the interior. Fits nicely over the arm. Simple design. Fun feel.<br /><br />There were some reviewers on here who complained about the price of this purse... which was very puzzling to me. After searching for purses that ranged from $20-$300 at my local department and discount stores, this seemed like a really good deal (not to mention exactly what I wanted). The purse is probably worth $35 and the fact it has Marilyn Monroe on it is all the more reason to spend a mere $10 more.<br /><br />Note: Try to view the wallet as just an &#34;extra&#34; for buying the purse. Thankfully, I only had the purse in mind when I purchased this item. The wallet is OK, but nothing to get too excited about. Other than having several compartments to organize credit cards and such in... there's not much else to say about it. But who cares about the wallet? It's the purse that's going to get all the attention! :)",1

I sized up to a large and am glad I did. It is a looser fit (not skin tight) and ties easily in the back still giving me a fitted, but relaxed look (see photos). The material is dry-fit and is comfortable and easy to move and stretch in. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with it. If you don‚Äôt want it to be skintight, I would definitely recommend sizing up one size. Hope that helps!",0

I‚Äôm 150 pounds and 5 foot seven ordered a medium if you are that size, get a small one I got was to baggie and I just don‚Äôt like it at all will not be wearing it.",0
5,Came as advertised and the quality is what I expected.,1
5,Perfect gloves.,1
5,"This cuff is wonderful.  It's so beautiful and the quality and craftsmanship is excellent.  I haven't taken it off since first putting it on.  It is so comfortable I can wear while sleeping, showering, etc.  I am sure it will remain beautiful for many years to come.",1
1,"One of the holding bars came broken, I can literally see the spring .. it doesn't seem to fit how the picture says it .. I'm very disappointed.",0
1,Didnt fit as expected..,0
1,This was a complete different item than I ordered not what I wanted at all.,0
3,"The dress overall looks great. Quality embroidery, color as depicted in the pictures. The fit is a bit more loose than I had expected. I got an XL based on the reviews, and I usually wear a solid SM. The ONLY complaint about this dress, which makes me hesitant to recommend, is the blue lining (the slip underneath) at the armpit area. The slip is completely sewed to the dress, and how it's sewed at the armpit area looks really awkward when you have your arms down. The result is simply very unflattering.",0
1,Wrong size,0
5,These are super cute and really comfy - not thin - will buy more of these,1
5,"Huge bag, unusual size, ordered it last minute on our way back from a trip, we accumulated a few extra things.  We simply dumped our dirty laundry into it, zipped it up and it traveled well on the plane (we checked it without a problem, too big for carry on).  I wouldn't put anything valuable, fragile, or breakable in it, there is no padding or support in the bag,",1
5,love it,1
5,Best robe I have.  It is warm and cozy without being bulky.  It washes and dries well in that it gets softer with use.  I highly recommend this robe.  It is great to run out and get the paper and mail.,1
1,Do not waste your money. Idea great if the strapless bra actually 'stuck' after 3 wearings. but the edges stop holding after meticulously following care instructions. I am also a small B cup woman weight and size is normal. Very disappointed. I hate bra's and the squeeze of straps etc.,0
3,"Fit is a bit small, but I will still keep it. Tight around chest and waist.",0
5,Great quality.. beautiful necklaces!,1
5,Cool retro style with excellent accuracy. Lightweight and very thin case. Drawbacks‚Äîstrap is a bit on the short side and thin. Nice collectible for its history and comfort. Well-worth it‚Äôs low cost.,1
5,Fit as expected. Smooth material. Durable. Cute.,1
1,"Cheap crap, dont bother",0
4,"Fits IPhone 8 Plus, keys, glasses and cash/credit cards easily. Soft. Nice price.",1
1,The earrings were unglued  poorly made This is the second purchase and probably my last,0
3,Sleeve runs small and color dull.,0
5,These socks made my feet feel better than they have in a very long time.  I am diabetic and these socks do wonders for my feet.,1
5,Great value,1
1,Material is cheap,0
3,Size not correctly described,0
2,Poor quality. Returned back to KingSize.,0
5,"Was a gift for my Granddaughter,  she called when it arrived, she's very happy with  it, says she loves‚ù§ loves‚ù§ loves it‚ù§!! And I am the best coolest Gma.",1
5,VERY ATTRACTIVE AND EXPENSIVE LOOKING  FOR THE PRICE,1
4,Very pretty leaves for any jewelry making project.,1
1,This has to be the weirdest fitting top of all time. It's extremely short and unlined. The unlined part wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't a two inch sliver of lining around the collar area. So even if you wear and under shirt there is this strange visible line,0
5,"Light and silky like,  but yet warm and comfortable.  Easy to pack and wash without shrinkage.  I bought two more in different patterns. Great for travel at hotels when room temperatures vary or hanging out at home.",1
3,Order Xtra large.,0
2,"Unfortunately, I‚Äôm returning this set. The top is stiff with very little stretch. I appreciate structured clothing, but when I‚Äôm sleeping I don‚Äôt like to feel restricted. Also I don‚Äôt know how this top would accommodate a growing belly. The pants are a completely different story. The feel of the fabric alone was a huge turn off. Not breathable very cheap feeling. The pants looked like a completely different size than the top. Top looked small for a large more like a medium and the bottoms looked like an extra large. The quality is not worth the price tag. You‚Äôre better off looking at Walmart or Target. I did find some great pj‚Äôs on Amazon from the brand WiWi. Pre-pregnancy 170 lbs, 8 months in I‚Äôm 192 lbs I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù",0
2,"I never thought I'd say this, but, too many pockets.  I cannot ever find what I need.  It might be great for a really organized person.  I am only moderately organized.",0
3,"It's lovely material, a sort of classic princess dress, but it's much larger than i was anticipating. It'd make sense if you had either a wide chest and smaller breasts or a small chest with pointy huge boobs (i just have a normal small d) but they're too small to fill the top and too large to fill the cup outline. Order a size down in this style is my best guess.",0
3,Little tight on the fit but otherwise as expected,0
3,It fits okay.,0
5,My son loves this mask! In fact I bought 2 of them on accident and he insists on keeping it! He loves it and it is fit to size! Thank you!,1
1,A lot smaller than thought they would be.  Great gift for a young girl.,0
5,They were a little bent on one side but I'm working with them to even then out,1
1,The horn was off to one side rather than the middle and it looked crooked when she put the headband on due to the offset horn.,0
3,I got it for my little cousin and it‚Äôs really nice. Only problem is the pink set came with two rings and one earring. Blue set is fine but it is sad that it‚Äôs not two complete sets.,0
5,"I prob own about 12 tshirts from kiddad. Maybe I have an addiction, who knows. Started off a few Christmas ago when a friend bought me a shirt as a gag gift  ( I don‚Äôt care shirt) well last summer I needed some more shirts so asked my firmed were she purchased it from since it fit so well, hadn‚Äôt faded and is super soft. She told me and here I am the proud owner of at least 12 different kiddad tshirts",1
5,I wish there were more colors available! (I'll have to make some of my own),1
5,My daughter loves!,1
1,The hat was so small !! I got two outfits for my son and daughter. And the boots were ridiculously big.  The material is super cheaply made. It‚Äôs a mess.  Gonna have to return,0
5,"Great purchase, fast service!",1
5,"I measured my foot and used the chart supplied by the company, not the Amazon fit chart, and these fit just right  I really like them.",1
5,Good product,1
5,It was simple and good for price for a young girls gift.,1
1,This arrived broken. I will be returning it.,0
2,The quality is fine but the size is too big. I ordered small and on my legs they fit fine but on my hips and front it doesn‚Äôt fit right.. just feels and looks weird on me..,0
4,"So far so good, sturdy enough to keep my sunglasses safe and lightweight at the same time. The zipper works fine now but feels a little cheap. Will update if/when the zipper breaks.",1
5,Good good good,1
1,Horrible!!! It was full of scratches and turned completely yellow!! It was not even close to being worth the money!! Do not buy this ring,0
5,"Nice fit, usual size.  Comfortable!  Because of band at bottom works for those of us only 5‚Äô2!",1
1,Received this band for Christmas and loved it. However 6 weeks later the silicone broke where it attaches to the watch. Disappointed. Not durable and wouldn‚Äôt recommend.,0
5,Love it. Super cute and makes me feels sexy.,1
3,Returning the key chain received because on one side closure was loose,0
5,Wonderful little hidden gem on Amazon!!! Highly recommend!,1
5,He‚Äôs obsessed with anything iron man I‚Äôm glad I could find some his size,1
5,I had 6 pairs from a previous purchase and wanted more.  They fit great and are priced very affordable.  These are NOT for bigger girls .....,1
5,Gift for my son and he loves it.,1
2,Looks cheaper than what I was expecting,0
3,The picture of this earrings looks better than the actual earrings and the color in the picture is darker pink.  Sorry!,0
3,"This earring is cute but it's hard to keep it on place, sometimes it keeps falling.",0
4,"seems like its good material, and the design is very pretty. it is a bit to long for me but that's an easy fix. I did order it May 14th and it came July 16th which is the only downside. But like if you don't mind waiting for something to be. shipped you should buy it  :)",1
3,Pretty but a little heavy,0
4,"The picture shown is enlarged so the earrings were smaller than I thought, even though there was a picture on a mannequin. Other than that, the earrings look totally cute. These are a gift to my mom, so they haven't been used yet.",1
5,It fits perfect and will have replacements for a very long time...very good quality.,1
5,I like large faced watches with numbers. I enjoy wearing this watch. Has both silver and gold tones.,1
2,"Runs small so I took one size larger.  I had to return my regular size for the larger size, and they were still too small.  So I had to return them again.  I did not re-purchase them.",0
3,I bought these from woolly directly months ago I‚Äôm size 34. They fit fine and were<br />Comfortable and cool. I ordered two more<br />Pairs from<br />Amazon. Same size and color. Well they fit completely different- super tight on the waist - like a whole size different. It‚Äôs quality control of some of these companies outsourcing - can‚Äôt keep sizes right. Can‚Äôt trust sizing so I won‚Äôt order again though I like the product.,0
3,"I have four other pairs of 90 Degree leggings - two cropped (90 Degree By Reflex - High Waist Tummy Control Shapewear - Power Flex Capri Legging - Quality Guaranteed - Black Medium), two full length. They all seem to be exactly the same and are staples of my wardrobe. They all have lasted for several years, too. When I saw a pair with pockets, I was thrilled. Well, the material is not the same as my other leggings. It's a little bit thicker, with a sheen to it, and the material is very slick. I don't know if it's the slippery fabric or the cut, but they slide down throughout the day and I have to hike them up. I also find that any slim fitting top I wear over it (in winter I usually wear a longer layering tank under a sweater) slides right up over the slick material, so I'm constantly having to pull my tank top down from where it's ridden up around my waist.  I wish the company would just put a pocket on those other leggings.  I wouldn't buy another pair of these.",0
5,Work great,1
3,Extremely thin material makes me hope I can wear it more than once.,0
2,I usually wear a large. This dress ran really small.,0
5,Nice.  Just what I wanted.,1
5,Love love these pjs,1
5,Gift,1
5,I fell in love just looking at the picture. I bought this after reading a few good reviews with the faith that it will fit me. I have a slim fit body style so only a few brands/limited choices I have to shop for such type of informal blazers. This is a good fabric material. Fitting is good if you are comfortable in wearing slim fit style shirts. I got a lot of compliments for this red color. Will definitely love to try other colors. I am very satisfied with this item.,1
2,flimsy,0
2,Not for me.,0
5,This bag is perfect for the gym! It seems like it would be too small but it fits a surprising amount of things in it. I love all the pockets inside as well.,1
5,Very sleek and pretty.  It fits well and I love it.,1
5,Real quality watch.,1
3,"I am giving 3 stars because it looks like it should have been good quality in route it arriving broken.<br /><br />My roommate and I both we're unable to open it.<br />It fully extends but doesn't open even a little bit.<br /><br />On a side note, the package had been opened when I received it and the umbrella cover was missing but I didn't see any physical damage find to the umbrella and it was still snapped.",0
2,The shorts have no cinch waste. they are way wide in the waist they would fall off my son's but .cheap  denim,0
5,"Delivered on time for my daughter's birthday. Although it's smaller than I thought, very pretty set.",1
1,See title. Returned immediately.,0
3,I absolutely LOVE this dress!! Super stylish & sleek! An bit tighter at the bust line area - But maybe not for everyone!,0
3,Bought this in the deals of the day. Looks better in the picture. The listed price is way too expansive. Sale price is more reasonable but wouldn't say it is a steal at all. I guess you get what you pay for.,0
2,A small looks like a large!  The lettering won‚Äôt last a wash. Sad,0
3,Nice if you are conservative. Earrings a little too small,0
1,Broke within a week,0
2,"Cheap, generic cap. Small print. When tightening to get the hat to fit, the lettering bunches up making it difficult to read...which was the whole reason for buying! Disappointed as it was intended as a gift.",0
5,Good quality. Great for BF,1
5,My new favorite pair. Went bald so now glasses are important accesories now for me and these are particularly bad-ass glasses! They make me feel like a bad Hollywood mf.,1
5,Loved it,1
5,"I got this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I love it,but it's a tad on the large size. It is made well & of a nice,soft material,too. This shirt would be perfect with leggings...nice & comfy!",1
1,Horrible! One pair was broken when we took it out of the package. And the second pair broke after a couple hours of wearing. Very cheap & crappy!,0
5,Cute spring/summer top. I love this shade of green. It‚Äôs stretchy material made it feel comfortable to wear.,1
1,Adorable!  But FITS WAY SHORT!!!!  Also didn't come with directions on how to work.  :(,0
1,"This is a TINY stone & the chain is not very nice either, you can't really slide the stone up & down the chain.  Not a good buy for the price",0
3,Love the colors but top itself seems to be made for petite height person. Kind of short on my 5'5 torso.,0
5,"Perfect!  Love them!  They're very soft, and not itchy/scratch.  I'm normally a women's 6 in sandals, 61/2 in regular shoes, and 7 in women's Uggs - and the Big Kids size 5 fits me perfectly!  I love the kids Uggs as they look smaller on your feet/not so clumsy looking, more fun styles and colors, and are CHEAPER!",1
5,god product,1
5,Nice t-shirt. Fits well and looks good.,1
2,Ugly tired gray no green anywhere thick hot not breathable,0
4,"I like these pants! They‚Äôre not she at all which is very nice, only thing is they bunch up a little and are a bit baggy feeling but i think that‚Äôs easily fixable buy getting the next size down. I was in between small and medium and got medium, wouldve been better with a small but still happy with these!",1
4,"I really liked the blouse I received, except I ordered 3/4 length sleeves and received short sleeves!",1
3,"It was pretty much what I expected however, it does run small",0
3,OK,0
4,"I really like the soft texture and draping of this cardigan; it's very comfortable. I have a black one and decided to order a white one. The color, however, is not true white. It's more like white with a purplish tint to it. So, I decided to return it and will look elsewhere for a truer white cardigan. I have not washed my black one yet (it's fairly new); I, therefore, can not comment on long-term durability or how it holds up during washing.",1
4,"I Love Lucy is my favorite TV show so I‚Äôm always happy to wear clothing around the house that reminds me of the show.  I received these pajamas for Christmas and I‚Äôve been wearing them a couple times a week even after the holiday ended.  I wear a size small and they fit as expected. The shorts hit mid thigh and are very soft, and the top is a little loose which makes it comfortable for sleeping. The graphic on the top is cute enough for wearing outside of the house, and the shorts are great for wearing all December because of the Christmas theme.  I wish the shirt was softer but I imagine it will be perfect after 15 washes or more. Great present for a fan of Lucille Ball, even if you gift yourself!",1
5,"Great pants!  The 40 waist does have a long inseam, but it is easy to toll the, up and they look nice.  I would recommend these",1
3,The zipper did not go all the way down but dress looks beautiful,0
4,"The bottoms fit perfect. However, the top is way to big. Very comfy and cute!",1
1,The quality is not good and the lights were damaged quickly,0
4,"As a bigger woman, the last thing I want is to bend over and have my backside crack in plain view for the world to see.<br /><br />From the picture, I thought they would stay up.<br /><br />These fit tight but zip easy, so they are not too big or small.<br /><br />I spend 75% of my time pulling these pants up as they work their way further and further down my hips until I look like MC Hammer.<br /><br />I like the pants, they are good quality and look nice.... well .... except they don't.",1
5,"I have small hands so cannot use where dexterity is needed. I use the whole glove as a potholder, very flexible with good grip.",1
5,I got it as apart of my Halloween costume. It match perfectly and I loved it.,1
2,"I like it because it keep me warm and comfortable, but the top too big and folding when walking",0
3,Kind of narrow fits like s/m instead of l/xl,0
2,"It had this extra fabric in the back that was confusing and unnecessary. I returned it, not for plus size.",0
5,I am very pleased with the quality of the material.  very nice,1
1,I may have liked these skirts if the sizing was correct,0
5,Perfect Fit,1
1,"Does not ""snap"" in, as soon as I move or flex my wrist either end pops off",0
5,So cute and so sparkly. Love them!,1
4,Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas she really liked it.,1
5,Love it,1
4,"I love this suit and have received many compliments on it.  It seems to be well made.  I have worn it to  about 5 Hydro-fit classes so far.  The color is much brighter and more appealing than in the picture. I am 5 ft. 3 inches tall and weigh about 115.  I vacillate between a small and a medium.  This particular suit was only available in small.  The top is a bit snug and I would prefer a medium but I am keeping it, as it is not so small as to be uncomfortable.",1
5,"This item is definitely as advertised.  It's a nice high quality material, very stretchy - and the gathering in the back looks ... hot.  No other way to put it.",1
1,"This watch is a complete waste of time and money. I got a brand-new, and the date and setting functions will not perform normally. I sold diamonds fine jewelry and fine watches for many years. This piece is worthless and is good for nothing but the trash I do have two other Invicta watches that he pretty good time but these two are a resounding disappointment you can read my review of the next one that I bought, but don't waste your time on this one. Go get a Timex Expedition if you're looking for an inexpensive but good timekeeper with a mineral crystal and normal water resistance. You won't find it here, save your money.",0
1,Buckle does not lay flat and digs in to wrist. Cannot properly adjust band. Crown wheel is too far in cutout to easily turn. The bands are molded and do not swivel on a pin so the band cannot be a perfect fit unfortunately. Color was cool though.,0
5,Wife loves the material.,1
3,"The plastic bar is a little too long so it doesnt sit nicely on my chest. It also feels cheap, but it looks like the picture",0
3,"The hoops were the size I wanted. Small for my ears but, did not hug my ear snug.  There was some drop down. I am not able to wear these because I can't get the back to close in such a tiny hole nor can my husband and friend. Not worth paying to send back.",0
5,Best quality material.<br />But not slim fit.,1
5,Got this for my father.  Very hard to find and he loved it,1
2,This cloak might be ok for children but not for an adult.  I couldn't get it around my neck.  It took weeks to get it.  It didn't cost much so it went into the trash.,0
4,"I am 5'7"" and weigh around 125lbs. I'm slender with long legs and a normal length torso. I purchased a medium but I should have gotten a small!  They are too big for me. It's not excessive, but enough where I will return them and look for something else.",1
1,I bought a Large and it still is very hard to put on.......once it's on I'm okay with it,0
5,This hat exceeded my expectations. The print is beautiful with a very breathable fabric. It also comes with straps for windy days so it won't blow off.,1
5,I ordered for a gift for a friend. It was a lot smaller than I expected so I returned it for a larger one. Return time was quick and easy. Thanks for a cute workout tank.,1
4,"Fits her well, looks nice, good quality and workmanship.",1
1,The first thing my husband said was ate those pajamas? The product doesn't look anything like the picture. The material feels like a children's Halloween costume.,0
5,"Good sized container of cleaner - have used it once on my diamond and platinum engagement ring and it's a quick and easy process that left my right nice and shiny. I do wish that the little brush didn't come inside of the container as it was just a little slippery and sticky to manage, but it's also the easiest way to keep track of it.",1
5,I liked the dry fit feel and it fit as expected.,1
5,These are the perfect size. I have a large head and face. My old KDs just don‚Äôt look right or fit right. I really like how the arms are slightly longer to reach comfortably over the back of my ears. The dark green lenses match my old ones perfectly. Very happy,1
5,Gorgeous and great quality,1
5,Worth the money came pretty quickly,1
2,"Nice band at first but it broke within 2 weeks, the part that broke was non repairable.",0
5,Arrived as pictured in a small box to protect it.,1
5,Very Cute,1
3,Very big size,0
1,not true to size,0
2,Broke same day it arrived,0
5,"Super cute, comes in a very pretty little box.",1
5,"They are great, but when I ordered  I forgot to look for glasses that fit over my prescription glasses.  They'll work.",1
2,Ordered to big & it does not fit right on me. The front hangs weird instead of a nice flat surface infront of the dress around stomach area. It was all ruffled & hanged I guess cuz it was to big on me. Also heads up pple if washed it will shrink majorly on length & not size. So instead of a dress close to the knees it came up more close to a really short mini skirt smh,0
2,Very cheap made,0
4,"TO BIG, BUT PRETTY !",1
4,"Soft fabric and really cute shorts! BUT, needed larger size than usual. With prompt shipping, was able to get a pair that fit in time for pictures.",1
2,It wasn't as cute as picture.. but my daughter loves it. The crown on the front of dress was damage since this was shipped from China. I am keeping but I wouldn't buy again.,0
3,"The band is really cute, but it seems to interfere with the step tracking. As soon as I started wearing this my daily steps were halved. Also this gets dirty really easily and it's hard to get on and off. It came with a tool but no directions. My husband managed to install it somehow.",0
2,Not 18k. I had them for less then a year. Wore them 7 or 8 times and they turned copper!!!!,0
5,The pockets are awesome and the feel of the leggings are so soft not like normal compression tight materials.  I love them,1
2,Too small.....,0
2,I just received them I like them but they are missing stone I front. I just contacted seller.,0
3,Everyone thinks my shirt is wet,0
3,So beautiful for women,0
5,Like,1
3,Fit is great but i hate the fabric. Its lime a stripper polyester not a nice cotton. Shiny like latex almost.,0
2,"It took a month and a half to arrive, it does not resemble the fur pictured and it was not true to size.",0
4,"At first opening  of the product out of the package, it looked so small but it does stretch really well. I was so surprised at how much it can stretch. It is a bit thin but you can‚Äôt really see through. It feels so soft and smooth. The length is pretty good given, that I am a short person. I won‚Äôt really use this pants when I work out. I would use it with some shirt that covers my butt , almost like a tunic. I just feel it being on the thinner side for my liking. But it is a good legging under a dress or a longer shirt. Its good to have but I would not say your go to leggings.",1
5,"A really cool, delicate looking watch which makes a great gift for those who appreciate these things.",1
5,Comfortable yet dressy. Nicely made and washes well.,1
3,Quite big. Nice material though.,0
5,just beautiful!!! i order a Small i am 5.0 and 115lb,1
1,This dress is not sized properly. It's way too tight/small.,0
5,Will buy again worth the money looks very classy,1
1,Nunca lleg√≥ en la fecha indicada y tuve que llamar para que me dijeran que no ten√≠an en producto. O sea debitaron el dinero pero no ten√≠an el producto. Fue un proceso tedioso con el banco para la devoluci√≥n del dinero.,0
3,Fabric was too thin. You could see my underwear through them. They were super soft but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to wear them.,0
1,These are very pretty but the stubs are big. when I put them through the holes in my ear they hurt.,0
4,The motor has nice detail.  The ring fits great.  The only down side.  I just noticed the letter HD on the sides.  I don't ride a Harley but I still like it,1
2,"The pendant shipped well and the energies are good. Its sturdy and seems like it will be a while before I need t worry about it breaking; however, I realized post purchase (my own stupidity), that it doesn't fully spell out abracadabra, it is missing several rows of letters.<br /><br />The design is nice and I plan to keep it. Its about the size of a US nickel.",0
5,Loved,1
5,"Great socks! They stay up and they breath Do not them. I am a men‚Äôs size 9.5.I would recommend them up to a size 9.5. If you have a larger foot, they would be too tight.",1
5,Amazing! The picture does this no justice. Very Well made bag great quality,1
1,It came with a hole in the pocket.,0
5,"I went up a size as the large was sold out,  so I expected it to be roomy. I loved it!",1
2,Have a very odd smell and came with a rip in them.,0
1,"The product image is very misleading. That costume is a photo of Bonk made by Matrices, which is a one of a kind hand-made costume, and definitely not for sale on amazon.",0
4,As described. Good quality,1
5,"Fits well&#62; I am happy with this purchase.Hot & body-hugging type. I'm 5'4&#34;, 130 pounds, 36C-33-37 & fits well.",1
5,Clothing fit perfect have a lot of room in my suitcase after packing everything.,1
1,These did not offer any support or lift for my size.,0
4,Good product. Maybe a little too expencive. One week into wearing them one came apart in the middle and had to be tied. TRUMP 2016,1
1,Poorly made and disappointing. Don't order this mask!!,0
5,Good looking. Light weight.,1
1,I am returning this product because  ratio of natural to  synthetic fibers is not satisfactory to me  it is not breathable.,0
3,its nice,0
1,"It's a lot bigger than what I wanted, the chain is longer than I wanted and it doesn't sit straight most of the time. Usually it's laying on me sideways-ish. I'm on the fence... 3 stars.<br /><br />UPDATED: After only a week, the chain is turning brown, so I can't wear it anymore unless I go out an buy a new chain for this. This isn't return eligible so good thing it was cheap. Don't waste your money unless you just want the castle pendant.  (In the photo I put it next to one of my real gold chains so you can see the difference.) 1 star",0
1,[[VIDEOID:202eedae30ad5c2ddeba4881d9c9358]] It doesn‚Äôt tic nor tok! Save the pennies you have! Worse buy ever!,0
4,Might want to go up 1 size if you want it lose. Love the feel of the material very comfortable.,1
3,More of a coral than a true red.  Matte finish and therefore a bit dull.  Yet the stones are lovely and for the price. . .($4) it's a GREAT buy!,0
5,"Bought this set as simple bridal jewelry for my bachelorette party; disnt want a tiara, veil or crown. Love cultural traditions and wanted another way to declare the occasion. Perfect fit and you can't beat the price!",1
5,Exactly what I wanted in the size I wanted and did it from home.,1
1,"The 6g flares are like 2g at the end of the flare, making it more or less impossible to get in.  No one who has gauged ears would craft earrings like this.",0
3,"It‚Äôs okay. The sweater looks wrinkled, quality ok for price. Looks a little cheaper, lines don‚Äôt match with stripes well. I thought the brown would be a little darker, but appeared lighter in person. I kept it bc it‚Äôs comfortable and fits well, but wouldn‚Äôt have picked it if shopping at the store.",0
5,Fits perfect! Super comfy! Fitted bottom I love this,1
1,"Strings everywhere, like wearing a hot dog on a stick hat",0
2,It shrinks in length each time it is washed.  It stretches out around the bottom. The longer you wear it the bigger it stretches out!,0
3,When I opened the box the hats had been pushed down in the box.  The box was too small which resulted in the hat being misshaped.  The back of the hats was turn up and so was the front of the hats and nothing seems to work to change their shape back to where it should be.,0
2,I had hoped the country names would show better but they tend to blend in with the background too much.  Bought it as a gift and just gave it anyway realizing it's the thought that counts. Wish the country name etching would've either had a darker background or been etched in an ink of a darker color or something that allows the names to stand out at a glance.,0
1,"bag is too big, color is off too, not good.<br />also not amazon prime, returning it cost you money, don't buy it",0
1,Very disappointed in this product. The moment I got it in the mail I put it on and the chain broke not even wearing for 1 min. I have a 26‚Äù waist so I did not make it too tight just enough for it to sit on my waist. DO NOT BUY VERY VERY CHEAP,0
5,"This is light weight for layering. I love it! It ashed great, doesn't wrinkle pockets are very handy and I get lots of compliments. I have it in four colors.",1
5,Cannot wait to make this into a necklace.,1
1,I had to send it back because the switch had a broken wire.,0
2,"I bought this product to keep my starter locs in tact as I sleep. The problem is that this doesn't stay on through the night. I've repeatedly woken up with half of my head exposed. I would have been a lot better off just wearing a durag. Add that to the dye bleeding everywhere and the logo peeling off a whole 6 days after I purchased it, and I just can't recommend this product.",0
3,"These are cute, but some of them are gold not the rose gold color.  The Clasp are hard to snap in ear as well.",0
3,"Ordered 3 of these to stack, all 3 arrived discolored and even after cleaning remain so. Very poor quality, would not wear these.",0
1,Too small. Size wrong,0
1,This picture shows a nice long item. It is about 12 inches shorter.,0
4,"Making allowances for a mature figure, this dress looks just as advertised.  I am 5'4, 114# and normally order a small.  Using the measurements in the chart, this is a medium and fits perfectly.  The one disappointment is that it's the most see-through dress I've ever had.  I'll definitely need a slip to step outside my door.",1
1,"I either don‚Äôt understand how to use these, or they are too small. So right now they are not in use and we‚Äôre a waste of money.",0
5,Actually this is not the glasses I wanted I will return them and order clip on shades,1
2,The ruched bust wasn't very attractive. The fit wasn't the same as other dresses I've bought from this brand. It felt tight and restrictive. Overall I did not like the fit of the dress and sent it back.,0
5,I love this watch .... Ecko makes very nice watches this is 2nd and will not be my last it is very heavy and the colors are bright and shiny it looks like a 100 dallor watch easy,1
4,Such a cute dress for the Spring/Summer! The material is nice and soft (almost silky even). It also fits as expected.,1
5,This dress is gorgeous! Bought for my 13 year old granddaughter for a formal and it is just perfect! Love<br />Love the<br />Color. Looks better than photo,1
5,Exactly what I wanted,1
3,Cute shirt<br />Very thin! Must wear a bra<br />Little small<br />Not comfortable,0
1,"Updated: Even less impressed! They reached out to me, after I attempted to post a bad review. They asked if they could fix the issue,  I happily responded, "" that would be great.... "" and then nothing from them.... for weeks, I reach out again... still no response.  So I guess they don't really want to fix the issue! Not impressed üò†. I've had this shirt for 2 months, and it is already coming apart at the seam? A very weird seam, that I can't fix by hand. I paid over $50 for this shirt and it's not worth $20, I've had shirts from Walmart last years? Of course it's made in china... so I guess I shouldn't expect much. Not happy the "" window "" of return has closed... they give you one month.  Don't waste your $50 on this cheap shirt.",0
1,This is the ugliest thing I have ever seen! It looks NOTHING like the picture! Do not buy this veil! The flowers are not the flowers pictured. The feathers are ridiculous....,0
3,"I had a similar pair that cost the same that dod not feel as cheap as these, but they are decent.  Worth the price, but don't expect much more for your money. If you just need a cheap pair of sunglasses,  I recommend these any day.",0
5,Makes you go low on the course and makes to look good on the town,1
1,No era lo que esperaba.,0
5,Went on in a breeze and fit perfectly.,1
2,They were considerably heavy. The back fell off and 2 gems popped out within a couple hours of wearing.,0
5,The price is right,1
5,Good,1
5,Love the color and all the wonderful pockets.,1
1,It broke the first time I tried to put it on.  Never got a change to wear it.,0
1,Not true to size and shorter than expected. The material is really soft.,0
5,"This outfit was perfect!! At first I was skeptical, but once it came in I was in love. True to size, color, and everything. Very well made for such a great price. My daughter doesn't want to take it off. Will be ordering again next year!",1
5,"I've been looking for a Michael Kors tote that was lighter colored and reasonable. This purse fits the bill. The zipper was stiff initially but with use became less stiff. I holds wallet, makeup case, coupon case, check book and lots of over knick-knacks. I even found the matching wallet that I bought separately. Great quality and authentic.",1
5,Happy with purchase.,1
1,The sizing is ridiculous. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 125lbs and the small fit like a giant tent!,0
4,Love the shirt. It‚Äôs a little tight around the neck.,1
5,"this was a perfect graduation present, my sister loved it!",1
5,"Nice dress shirt, good price",1
3,Thin material. Does absorb sweat well. Doesn't compress.,0
4,Ordered this to go with my home made panda costume as face paint makes me itch. Arrived on time and undamaged. Looks great with my costume and look forward to warring it to Halloween parties,1
5,"My ears are pretty sensitive to different metals but I had no issues with these. I also don't like heavy earrings but I wanted something special. These were a great, unique and beautiful earrings to wear for the holidays! I got lots of compliments.",1
1,ONLY good thing about these is they trim easy.That being said these are complete GARBAGE! They are hard to stick and if lucky and get them to stick there are bubbles bubbles  and more bubbles that will NOT come out! Don't waste your money these are HORRIBLE !,0
2,These are for sure lightweight!! So lightweight they feel cheap.  But I guess $18 is cheap. Small for sunglasses imo,0
5,"The quality is good and I liked its visual side and how it operates in the sunshine, so my choose was correct.",1
5,These are exactly what I was looking for. They have big lenses and cover the whole area of my eye so I don't have to squint at all. These fight glare from the sun and ocean fanstically which is exactly what I needed them to do.,1
1,"The tracking on these was terrible. It never updated from Package Shipped.<br /> When I asked for information on when they would be received they couldn't give me anything. When I put in for a refund they all of a sudden had specific information and they had gotten delivered that day. Great, got them, only a bit irritating.<br />Out of the 10 there are 2 that the black filter piece has not fallen out of. They have not even been used! Two were off when I took them out of the package, and the others came off in the first washing. Can't say I am happy with spending $37 to get two usable masks that I imagine will also come apart in very little time. I would not suggest buying these at all.",0
5,"I got these for my 2 year old daughter for her first pair of earrings to change into after getting them pierced. She loves minnie mouse, and it is hard to find stainless steel earrings for a reasonable price or in stores (I didn't want her to have sterling silver or anything else for her first new pair.) These are adorable and a great price. She loves them!",1
4,nice and warm,1
5,its tight but i look good,1
5,"This hat was very warm and comfortable in weather averaging 20 degrees. It's nice and soft, but , more importantly- it's not TOO warm on your head. I previously had a hat made from beaver pelt, which cost five times as much as this. The beaver hat was so hot, even in the coldest days, that it made my head sweat, and was uncomfortable. I'm sure it would be perfect in , say, the Dakota's when the wind chill hits 40 below. This shearling hat, though, was a complete bargain and of high quality. I was a little weary when I opened the box- the hat is very lightweight. Don't be discouraged by that, it does the job well.",1
4,"The perfect muscle tee. So stretchy, comfy, and perfect. I will be going back for more colors!",1
5,This hat is so cute! I bought it as a Christmas present but couldn‚Äôt wait to give it to my step son. He loves it and has worn it nonstop! It‚Äôs warm and soft. Perfect to keep a little guy warm!,1
1,Most quarter zips are light weight.  This one is like a sweatshirt.  There was no way to tell that from the picture.  Oh well.,0
1,"Very tight across chest, shoulders and arms. Washed the dress 3 times, and it still smells funny, like a chemical. When I tried it on before washing, the fabric that touched my skin turned bright red and was very itchy. I threw it away!",0
1,Chinese garbage. There is dust under the glass. Ticking sound is very loud. Dont buy this garbage.,0
5,Great quality. Held together very well. Not junky at all.,1
1,"I washed my hands and the coloring ran all over my hands, got in my clothes and the string came untied all within the first 3 hours of wearing it.",0
1,Broke after wearing only a couple times.  Would not recommend.,0
1,"Turning wrist black. I would like yo send back or replace, please",0
1,Didn‚Äôt fit. Way too small,0
5,The life changing things is actually knowing about shearling insoles. I have them in a number of my winter footwear and I looooove them! So cozy. When I slip on my old LL Bean boots with these insoles I'm reminded that the little things in life make a big difference. A welcome comfort after spending 13 hours on my feet as an ER nurse.,1
4,"I bought this as a maternity coverup to wear with tank tops and t-shirts because I am a little self conscious of my arms currently, have yet to wear it out but it fits nicely!",1
2,"I absolutely adore Octopuses and was so excited to find this dress! The colors were just gorgeous!! Unfortunately, the dress quality was poor. The top of the dress, the black portion, has strange seam going up the center of each breast. It makes it very strange looking and leaves a pucker at the top of the breast seam. It's awkward and doesn't make sense to have it there. Also, the skirt starts way too high on the dress, making you look quite heavier than you really are. I would say on me (5'9 175lbs) the skirt line starts about 3"" above my belly button. It left me with a strange ""bubble"" effect. The satin of the skirt is unforgiving. It's stiff and doesn't ""move"" making the high cut make me look like a stiff cupcake. I was super disappointed because it looks just beautiful online. Note, I did have to return my original size and to a higher one and it did not make a difference. Even though it didn't work out for me, the return process was quick and simple, so it's worth buying to see if maybe it works better on you and your frame.<br /><br />I give 2 stars because it wasn't complete garbage and the return process was so easy.",0
3,The waist is big not flattering and causes a muffin top.,0
5,Love these boots!,1
1,"It's listed as a crew neck, I received a weird turtleneck like product that Just looks like the shirt has a 3rd arm...",0
2,Very cute but clasp broke within second wearing.,0
3,Original was a better band.,0
1,Didn't like the glasses,0
4,much bigger than i thought,1
1,This looks like polyester not cotton. Very shiny and very large. Looks like something my grandmother would sleep in. Horrible.,0
1,"Very thin material, it is completely see through. You can't wear ANYTHING underneath, but at the same time you absolutely need to wear something underneath.",0
3,the coating on a couple of the gold teeth was incomplete but it overall fits with a costume type of item. Clasp for the necklace could be easily broken as well.,0
3,"I wanted something my daughter could sleep in, but this is costume material with a thin liner. As a costume, it's fine, but I took off a star because it is NOT pajamas. (Update: the lining is coming completely apart.  It only took a few wearing and washings it started shredding.  The outer part is still fine,  but the lining is going to have to be completely removed. )",0
4,"I ordered it for my bridesmaids. I love the color, fit perfectly..",1
5,Love this basket. Purchased for my husband to our small items in from the garden. He is fond of it as well. Holds just enough. Basket is deep enough for multiple small tomatoes and peppers.,1
5,Broke my wrist and had issues putting on clothes.  This shirt saved the day.  If fits well and is made very well,1
5,"I starred using this under my shoulder pads in ice hockey, after I sustained a rib injury. It fits great, and protects well, especially against cross-checks to the back in front of the net.",1
5,I was perfect!,1
1,"First of all the description says bracelet is 8 inches.  It measures 8 1/2 inches.  Secondly, it does not stay fastened.  There is a fit it lock, it does not work, and also to safety caches, they do dot work either.  I am returning it.  Also, the 5mm is beautiful but too large to look real.",0
1,Broken,0
3,Nice but run small on my neck,0
5,LOVED IT,1
2,The product was good but we really needed the uncle charm and we didn't get any of those we got extra aunts. Very disappointed because it was needed for a funeral.,0
4,The compression and fit is good.  The only thing I don't like is the stay up top is a bit tight and will leave red marks on my skin. Hoping that this softens up a bit..  Other brands I have gotten have a smooth stay up surface while this one isn't and leaves dot marks on the skin.,1
5,"First, I want to thank WalletBe for answering my question. Not only did my Samsung Z Fold 2 fit in the cell phone pouch, it fit with a slim case on! I had been searching for a wallet/cell phone case ever since I got the phone and was disappointed with every choice I made. Now I'm a happy camper!<br /><br />Not only does my phone fit, but it has the perfect space for credit cards and business cards that I routinely carry with me. Plus, it's a wallet (can put in a larger purse) or it has a wrist strap/short strap, or a shoulder strap/crossbody!<br /><br />I read reviews all the time where people say the crossbody strap isn't long enough for them, but this one is longer than I will ever need it to be. I'm 5'9"" and with the strap expanded all the way (worn crossbody) the wallet hits BELOW my hip! I'm no slouch when it comes to a chest either. :)<br /><br />In any event, my search for the perfect wallet/cell phone case is over. Thank you WalletBe! I'll be back.",1
3,Pocket flaps are weird. Fit as expected.,0
3,Cute but runs small.,0
4,"Got it for my almost 5 year old. He loves it and it seems warm. It just barely fits him and he‚Äôs on the small side, so if you have a larger 5 year old it may be too small. One of the pom poms also came off the first day he wore it.",1
3,a bit big. hung on my nose weird and it was pretty low and just looked like too much was going on on my face. but it really depends on the person wearing it and what you like.,0
1,"Horrible product look nothing like pictures, just a blur very unhappy do not buy this garbage.",0
1,Don't buy these for your child! Save your money! The material is not stretchy at all and I would have hurt him trying to force them on.,0
5,Fit nice and snug my lady likes the way my butt looks in these.,1
1,Way smaller than indicated. Waste of money.,0
5,Hands free,1
5,Very pleased with these socks.  I would buy them again.  Highly recommend them.  GO IRISH!,1
2,"I never knew that there was no pocket until I received it, but i'll use for a present",0
3,A bit tight if you have fatter fingers. But a pretty ring,0
5,"Amazing, but back flips up a lot. But seriously, it looks so dang cute!",1
4,Good dress for the price. I received a lot of compliments when I wore it. It rides up a bit so I kept having to pull it down because the split in the back would show too much of you don't. I'm 6ft tall. It looked nice for work.,1
3,The shirt runs small. The discretions says some graphics may have glitter. There are different designs. This one is pictured with no glitter. The Dragonfly is covered in gold glitter. The company charges $6 to return the shirt. The shirt only cost $9.33. So I guess I‚Äôm keeping it or selling it in a garage sale.,0
1,Bought because of heavy duty description and it was available for shorter ship time. Tried to tighten the webbing and the buckle housing just broke apart. Very poor quality. Flash on the part too.,0
2,Very cheaply made. Definitely not worth the $29.99. I don't know what kind of pins this was made for but the pages are way too thick for putting pins in. The fabric is cheaply put together with the bag coming with loose threads all over. The page are put together with 3 uneven strips of velcro on the edges in order to fold them and I don't think anyone who made these has actually used this bag because it constantly scratches you and gets in the way.,0
1,Love this purse but.....tha zipper will not budge and I‚Äôm about to send it back because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna rip it open it I‚Äôm afraid to even try to open it,0
5,Very pleased with this dress.  It fits true to size and is very nice quality fabric.  Faster than expected delivery.,1
5,I love my boots but y'all sent me two pairs so I have to send one back,1
2,My husband said so cheap looking he wouldn't wear it.,0
5,"I love the purse, but the straps could be longer.  But overall I love it.",1
2,"I purchased this shirt in another color and fir was perfect, but this white one came a little small.  I don't know if this is a manufacture issue or the material.  Other than that its good for the price",0
1,"Not really a fan of these. I ordered 2 sets because of the price but I should have known better.  The material is soft, which I like, but the head bands are paper thin and I don't think it will do any good in keeping ears warm.  I am returning these.",0
3,Waist was way way too small.  Will be returning.  Length was perfect for my 34 inch inseam.,0
2,"I purchased helmet liners from two companies, these are two inches smaller. My first question was, are these for kids? Too small. Not comfortable",0
3,"Cons:<br />- My only complain and such a shame coz I really like the pants otherwise. It is not completely waterproof! There is a different fabric band in the middle and thats not waterproof. The rest of the pant is fine. If you can manage not having rain hit your shin, then you are good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Its a very good quality product!<br />- The main fabric(barring the middle band) is waterproof<br />- material is soft and doesn't make noise when walking.<br />- In a rib boat adventure, we were to stand and sit while speeding. They seat got water splashed, but these pants kept me dry.<br /><br />Fit is decent. It is straight down with no tapering. Since its just for ski/rain pants, it doesn't matter much.<br />On my Iceland trip, in rain, I got my inner layers soaked from lower thigh to socks.",0
5,Absolutely love this dress! Fits as expected. Very comfortable too.,1
3,"I ordered this 2 sizes bigger than mine, and it fits pretty snug. Also, not nearly as long as it looks in the picture.<br />It's still really comfortable and cute, just runs small.",0
4,"Bought it for my daughter. She loves it, it very thin though.",1
5,"It looks very nice on but it does feel loose, im 5‚Äô7 156 lb I usually will order a M but i had to return this one because it was a little too long for me. So maybe size down. And im also 34C  and it wasn‚Äôt really tight at the top so i wasnt afraid to size down, bc its stretchy.",1
2,"Pretty earrings, extremely difficult to unclasp- at least the first time.  Hope this can be fixed because otherwise I may have ordered more.",0
3,"I ordered these as a gift and expected the swirled rainbow earrings as pictured. Instead, received the .5"" Round Nylon posts in assorted colors GirlPROPS also sells. Did not bother returning the set after triple checking to make sure the mistake was not mine; after all, it's only $4.99 and the recipient loved those too. Decided to give some sort of review for this product I originally ordered just in case the incorrect fulfillment happens on a regular basis--that way, other customers are pointed in the direction of the .5"" Nylon earrings they should be expecting. [[ASIN:B003U9JRCA Set Of 18 .5"" Round Studs (9 Pairs), Nylon Posts In Assorted]]<br /><br />But still satisfied, nonetheless.",0
5,Love it. Super comfortable and at a great price.,1
1,Love the style but shoes are way too small.  I will have to return them.,0
3,Nice ..but definitely not for men..I originally purchased it for my self but upon receiving it decided it was more suitable for my daughter.,0
3,"Somewhat small and uncomfortable. Im a 36 b/c and is wasnt big enough around my torso. The cups are fine and it looks great, besides the elastic digging into my back and under arms. This was a one size fits all and i have found similar item in s m l sizing which i would order next time in large.",0
5,Great buy,1
4,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and feel this sweater is a little short. It‚Äôs really wide and long in the arms.,1
2,"I noticed there was a split seam on the ""brim"" of the hat. The wool material appears to be good quality but workmanship and stitching is very poor. If you buy this expect to have to sew up any holes before you can wear it.",0
1,"Although it fits well enough, is comfortable the elastic on the right side snapped and broke the second time I wore it.",0
1,I must have been half asleep when I placed my order,0
5,I love them,1
1,Este conjunto no me sirvi√≥ ya que es muy angosto de hombro y de brazo. Un problema enorme para quitarlo. Si eres ancha de hombros no lo compres. Compr√© un xl,0
3,Cute dress but it‚Äôs see through and the material seems too fancy for a beach day cover up.,0
5,"This can be a foundation to your dance wardrobe. You can use silver or gold that you already have or get additional accessories in a color. Good for tall ladies, wear with shorts underneath, high slit.",1
5,"Great design, correct fit, great shirt!",1
5,Such a beautiful product. Very Classy!,1
5,Love these glasses,1
5,"So cute! Surprised at the quality considering the price, well worth it.",1
5,These glasses are great because they're polarized 2 let you see better and when you're driving you can see better in the rain. I would highly recommend them. And I like the fact that you can flip them up,1
5,these leggings are buttery and soft. They just like my lulu aligns. I also like aerie but I think ill be buying leggings from here from now on. I am 5'5 and ordered the smallest size ( I like to size down in leggings) these fit perfect. Very happy with my order!,1
4,"I have a pair and bought another for my friend, who was sick and stayed home most of the time.  These helped her feel special with their great red color.  They're the ruby red slippers for home!",1
1,"This is the second ring that I got. I had to exchange the first one , because the glue was all over the top of the stone. The replacement ring had a gap between the stone and the ring ( like the stone was too small for the ring ) and it set up high on one side (it wasn‚Äôt leveled). Don‚Äôt waste your money!",0
5,"Used it for a while as my main wallet, it works great, it feels like real leather and it's durable so far, I beat the heck out of my wallets, and it seems to be just as stiff as it was when new, and it's definitely high quality<br /><br />Recommended.",1
5,"Bought for my dad who works in concrete/construction, and these socks help not only during the cold, but so he doesnt have his toes rubbing on each other from the steel toe boots. He loves these! Will buy again and again!",1
1,"Misspelled heart as heat.  Always in my ""heat"".. this is embarrassing.  I want a refund.",0
2,"Fabric is great. Love the high waist. When I first opened, it felt like an expensive, quality legging. But the FIRST time I wore, the threads started to unravel in THREE locations. Because I wore and can‚Äôt return, I‚Äôll have to pay to have these fixed if I want to wear them again. Might as well just buy the expensive leggings next time.",0
2,I didn't like the material,0
5,I lose sunglasses all the time and only allow myself to buy cheap ones. These are the best cheap sunglasses I've had. I hope I don't lose them anytime soon.,1
2,"They were a bit smaller than represented, but love the look. They are not much bigger than the button it replaces.",0
4,I received this as a Christmas gift. The color is really beautiful! The fabric is a little scratchy but easily fixed with a tank underneath.,1
3,"These weren‚Äôt as dark as I thought they would be, the feel was cozy and high waisted. Way longer than I hoped and I am 5‚Äô7",0
2,"The studs are easily folded every time I put them off, one stud was broken on second day I wore it, Disappointed((((",0
5,"My son uses this backpack this school year 2019/2020. He loves it. Lots of storage/pockets. Seems to be durable. I hope the zippers hold on at least till the end of the school year. Nice color, well done, happy kid.",1
5,Great shirt,1
4,like the hat very much esp. with brim keeps my head warm,1
2,Not as advertised. Inside lining dimensions 2 inches smaller the the outside which prevents you from utilizing the full dimensions ofvthe bag,0
3,"CONS: Loose, feels like it will stretch over time, rides high, the thigh part is shorter than as advertised so it stops high thigh near the groin rather than mid-thigh.<br />PROS: it's bamboo and feels great. the red color is fantastic.<br /><br />If I could do it again, i'd:<br />1. order a 'Large' cuz the XL is too big<br />2. find a version with longer thighs<br /><br />I'll update once a few washes are under me and tell you if the color leaks, shrink or expandage, and waistband elasticity.",0
2,These shoes are so hard and uncomfortable. Not as cute and I was expecting either.,0
1,Shows every single bump and flaw you have. Definitely returning this.,0
5,Love this ... runs slightly small.,1
2,Too big.  Looked wide and frumpy.  Very soft and comfortable though.  I guess I need to order a smaller size. Ordered a large and it was way too big.,0
5,"Sleeves are too long, but te rest was perfect! Love it!",1
3,"This is a thin jacket and really, really oversized.",0
1,One of the tank tops came with a small hole when I received them. They seem to be good quality other than that...I still will be returning because of the poor condition.,0
5,I bought it for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it loves loves loves it,1
4,"There is a big discrepancy in sizing. I have ordered two pairs. One black, one grey. The black pair is baggy in the waist and fits a little loose in my legs. They stretch out a ton when I wear them, probably because it started out a little big. Knowing this, when I ordered the second pair, I considered getting a small. I am so glad I DIDN'T. The grey pair was so tight when I first got them that I thought I had ordered the small. I didn't. They were skin tight. Fortunately, I bought them for working out and since that's going well they fit better now, but holy geez, they were so tight I thought I was going to be able to pull them up! They nearly cut off the circulation to my lower leg.<br /><br />That being said, I would still recommend them. They are great for working out, not at all restrictive and I've never once been concerned about my butt showing during squats. They are a nice material and seem to hold up well.",1
3,Fit as stated,0
5,I like,1
5,"I loved the fact that it‚Äôs unisex. I love how that look and so warm. I got these as a Christmas gift for my father and he love them ,and the price was unbelievable. I would buy them again.",1
3,"The earrings I received look like they have been sitting in someone's jewelry box for about 20 years. They are VERY tarnished and used looking. They mostly cleaned up okay but the large black spot on the tip of one of the post spirals actually wont come off completely. I will try and clean them again with liquid silver cleaner as I only have a silver cleaning cloth and I‚Äôm sure it will come off but honestly, I shouldn‚Äôt have to put this much work into something that‚Äôs supposed to be brand new... I am very disappointed.",0
1,"Is it breathable? Yes. Is it protective? No. The whole point of masks is to keep particles from leaving or entering the mask. By buying one of these, you are effectively spending money to get/give the virus. Just buy a mask with a design or bedazzle your own mask, but dont waist your money on this.",0
2,Was really cute but really really thin. For 40 bucks go to Marshall‚Äôs.,0
5,"Very comfortable to wear, don‚Äôt even feel that I have them on.  Easy to put on or take off.  Comforting to know the if I were in an accident, first responders would be aware that I am on a blood thinner and specifically Eliquis",1
1,"I had high hopes for this as a dress watch case and band for my Apple Watch. Very heavy and looks nice. Quality felt good. But once I installed the Apple Watch inside this case and screwed in the back, the Apple Watch face touch screen quit working! It lost all touch sensitivity and input. Nothing. Removed the Apple Watch, touch screen worked fine. Reinstalled and the face quit again. Bummer. Also, the Watch screw crown control and side button functions did not work well once inside the case. Returned it today. I have many Apple Watch cases and bands, one in metal, but this one rendered the Watch not functional. Another note- the screw backing is sturdy but the installation takes time and tools. I switch cases and bands for work and then for sports. This case will make that daily swap hard because if screws and tools needed. For these reasons I can‚Äôt recommend buying it.",0
5,Perfect in every way!!!!,1
3,material was thinner then I thought it would be.,0
5,"I have small feet (size 5) so these socks don't show my toe but I'm not sure for others. Overall these are very soft and stretchy, good quality for the money.",1
3,"Very comfortable.<br />they havae a nice look to them.<br />However, I've only worn them twice and one of the lights on one shoe doesnt change from green.",0
3,Soo cute and i love the color/texture... unfortunately it does not work if you have any curves. Half my buttcheeks were out! So if you are petite and not curvy you will probably love it! Top is appropriate to your standard size.,0
4,Very pretty dress and you don't have to iron it!,1
3,"The shirt is darling, but waaaay too big. I'm due any day now, so I don't have time to exchange it. I ordered a small, based on the size chart, expecting a size 4. What I got was a size 6/8. I hoped to shrink it in the wash by using hot water, but no luck; technically a positive about the shirt quality. Very nice shirt, but disappointed in how it worked out for me.",0
5,"Very nice, excited for using them at my bridal shower this weekend.",1
1,I am a small in shirts and my mother is a large in womens and I gave the shirt to her b/c it was that big. Looks exactly like the picture though and recieved it in a timely manner.,0
3,Disappointing but wearable.,0
2,"Fit is appropriate.  Appearance starts off nice, but quickly degraded.  The sneakers are lightweight which make them comfortable, but is likely one of the contributing factors to literally lasting only 5 weeks of daily wear by my 1st grade child.",0
3,Cute but they are very flat and thin. I wanted something thicker decided to return.,0
5,"I LOVE this dress.  I'm glad I read the reviews first to see that it ran a little small. I typically wear a size L, so I bought an XL just incase.  It was a good fit.  It's comfortable and lightweight.  It's breathable fabric and stretchy material.  I received a lot of compliments! Would definitely buy this dress again in a different color.",1
5,I have had socks from many of the biggest names and none are as comfortable as these.  Living in a warm environment with summer temp above 90 and I still comfortable with these.  People complain about the price but my first is near 2 years old with no signs of wear and they have a lifetime guarantee.,1
1,Run small,0
5,Holds card cases well.,1
3,Alot smaller than I expected. The stones in two pairs have fallen out.,0
1,"Only received one pair of gloves, the description was incorrect. Never heard back from the seller.<br /><br />I do not recommend.",0
3,These are super cute and the perfect length. But one of the plastic ones was defective and the sides of the bar are not smooth (see photos),0
5,These pants are so comfortable I don't even realize they are on.  They stay put and are squat proof.  Love them!!!,1
5,"Good quality, great color",1
3,"They are a bit tight around the foot. Can't wear cushioned socks with them, gotta be thin ones. Other than that, I like them.",0
3,too small so I returned,0
2,Bought this early September. This work just fine for about a month. Now I have to be very careful because it will pop out at the most random times. Will not buy again.,0
5,Very nice shoes and they look great. Bright red color is really catchy!,1
1,"I was so excited to get these pants. I tried them on and they looked great. I wore them the next day and got several compliments. Then after just a couple of wearings I noticed that the elastic bands in the fabric were starting to break along the seams. They were very visible, especially in the seam along the butt.  I could not wear them. So, I bought another pair hoping that it was just that first pair that I had. I've worn the new pair one time and the same thing is happening. With this pair, the threading along the seam is already pulling apart.  I'm so disappointed because the pants are comfortable and do really look nice. But they are obviously cheaply made.",0
2,The patter leaves imprints on your leg after a 12 hour day. I bought a simple striped pair from this brand that did not do that. Will only be buying socks without patterns. Otherwise does a great job for compression.,0
4,Great but looks cheap,1
5,"Very light jacket, but that is what my 15 yr old son likes.  I bought a couple of different jackets in different colors since my son wears a jacket year around.",1
4,"Comfortable and spacious to wear. Everything a hoody should be! Fits to your typical size. Pockets are placed perfectly to rest your hands. Washes and does dry nicely, doesn‚Äôt pill or leave little balls on the sweatshirt. Great piece!",1
5,An authentic lovely coach bag .It just as I excepted,1
3,"It‚Äôs ok. It is very warm and fits ok. The length is short. If you have any type of belly, or longer torso, go up a size or two.",0
3,It cracks start to look bad after awhile.,0
1,"it‚Äôs a very cheap dress and the design is not that great, it seems like it was painted with a rubber paint, has a bit chemical smell. but it fit just fine",0
3,I didn't expect a well built sunglass but these were beyond cheaply made ... only needed for a couple days & broke the 1st day .,0
5,Exactly what I needed.  Good quality.,1
5,Omg these shoes was more beautiful than I expected. True to size and my daughter loved them. She wore them to her father daughter dance.,1
5,Perfect for my husband. True to size,1
5,Perfect addition to my St.Patty‚Äôs day outfit! Super trendy! Great quality! Affordable!,1
5,This set of thermals are very comfortable and have really good thermal qualities. Can't beat the price.,1
3,"just changes colour to fast, its ok<br />but it change colour the first day I used it",0
2,"I'm 4'11&#34; and the small was way too small. The gap in the front was too far apart as well, so a larger size would not have worked for me. Pretty and good material, though!",0
1,I can't get on my foot,0
3,"Nice quality, size large, except for elastic waist, a bit tight. Despite pull strings it cannot be adjusted.",0
3,Its a little more purply periwinkle than I wanted. The set is nice though. Just not for the event I wanted it for. My wife's dress was a nice sapphire blue so this just didn't quite complete the look she wanted for the night.,0
1,"Bought this for my friends birthday a month in advance and left it in the packaging. I just gave it to her Friday September 20th and it already broke but because I bought it so far in advance, I can't return it. Super disappointed and annoyed.",0
3,The leg is much shorter than it looks in the picture.,0
1,This shirt runs too small. i got xl my daughter wears a small and it fits her!,0
5,"My 2 year old absolutely loves these shoes, He even wants to sleep in them. He points to his feet anytime there missing and says pup shoes. They are good quality and the lights are bright. I would recommend these shoes to any little paw patrol fan.",1
2,"This watch band looks beautiful,  is easy to adjust,  and fit my tiny wrist perfectly.... only problem was our turned my wrist green within 2 weeks of wearing it!! The silver coating started coming off immediately,  and by week 2 I was green each time I wore it.  :(",0
3,"These really do look like real jeans, they are very cute. The issue with these is that because they do not have a zipper or button and the waist is not AT ALL stretchy, they are somewhat difficult to pull over your hips. Also, I ordered the size I usually wear in jeans & the legs fit very well but the waist was a little snug. My advice would be to order a size up & just use the drawstring to adjust the waist size. This is my only pair so I can't speak for the other designs but as far as looks they look good but they don't really feel like pajamas, especially at the waist. Put just a little elastic in there & they'd be perfect.",0
1,Ugly,0
5,Great service & great product. Thank you!,1
3,Feel of fabric,0
2,"Great idea, but not that great of a quality... I bought the headrest right before the trip with a red-eye flight on the way back. Inflated it on the way there and it was very comfortable. I was impressed! However, on the way back, when I needed it the most, one side started leaking air and deflated. I tried inflating it couple times, but it would not hold at all. It was so disapointing. Returned to amazon for refund. I might give it another try next time I travel as I liked the comfort and it is possible I just got a bad one... But be warned.",0
3,"Very comfortable and easy to adjust, but the underwater view is somewhat distorted. Maybe because of the curved lenses.",0
5,My friend loves frogs,1
4,they are fine,1
5,"I wanted a dress to honor the Ukraine, and this is it! It's covered with cheerful sunflowers. The dress is a nice soft knit that can be worn on many occasions. The waist is a little high. Nice and long, and it has pockets!!",1
5,Very nice fit,1
5,I've bought this item for my 12 years old son (he is the fan of the game Watchdogs). And the size is fit as expected. You can change the lenght or the rubber band as you want. It's good for the teens and for adult in the same time.  Thank you!,1
5,Excellent staple piece for my wardrobe,1
5,Bought it as a birthday gift for my mom and she loves it. The butterfly is a little bigger than I thought it  would be but it's not too big. She says it's the perfect size. I would buy it as a gift again for another person.,1
3,"This was supposed to be a gift for my daughters friend, but due to the tacky ""refund policy"" sticker on the back I think it looks too cheap to give as a gift. Disappointed.  :(",0
3,"This was a very cheaply made hat. While it does look like the hat from the viral snake-y snake video, it started falling apart and had to be glued back together within the first day we had it. Fun for a gag gift. Not so great quality, especially considering the price. It is a thin, felt material with an elastic string to hold it on. It is definitely sized more for a little kid (as you'd expect).",0
5,"Very pretty with just enough sparkle.  The only thing I dislike is the last 2 inches of the necklace is made of extender material, which doesn't look as nice when my hair is up.  If I don't use the extender piece, it becomes a choker necklace and it was not advertised as such.",1
5,I love these so much good quality and detail!!! Highly recommend!!,1
2,this is a high quality product in terms of material and looks and the interchangeable magnets is a great idea....the big problem with this product is the placement of the magnet...it's placed to high to attach to a shirt pocket...if the interior magnet could be placed lower so that it was near the fabric of the pocket so the holder won't fall out it would have gotten 5 plus stars from my dad.  If you looking for a handsome eyeglass holder with an attractive American Flag or Doggie Paws magnet to make it unique (without expecting it to attach your shirt pocket) then you have come to the right place.,0
3,good. Returned did not fit Galaxy S5,0
1,I purchased an XL and it wouldn't fit over my hips let alone give me enough room to wear as a flowy swimsuit cover up. I am a size 14. I had to give this away ‚òπÔ∏è,0
1,This is garbage. But you get what you pay for right?,0
5,These are my new favorite leggings! They fit amazing,1
1,crystals come off very easy.,0
5,Very soft and adjustable. Look great and is confortable to wear,1
5,I love this shirt. The material was soft and it was very girly. I got so many compliments.,1
2,"Cute material, but a tent would be an accurate description since it's very long and large.",0
4,Not as warm as I had expected but they work pretty well all the same. I had expected the lining to be a bit thicker but that's quite fine. They serve their purpose and fit fabulously.,1
5,"Love this coat! Very warm and blocks out the wind, rain and snow very well!",1
2,It is very fragile and hard to put on.,0
5,"I hesitated in ordering this dress.  The price was so cheap, I thought surely, I would be disappointed.  When I received this I immediately tried it on, and surprised it looked wonderful.  I proudly wore it to an event and received many compliments.  It was a great dress and an even better price!",1
4,I am going to send it back. It was a little small. I am skeptical about ordering a smaller size. I am afraid it might be too small. The hole in the back was a little to large for my style and comfort.,1
5,"These are pretty, lava stones fit perfectly.",1
3,Too warm.  Can't breathe!!!,0
4,Made from a soft formed material that was very comfortable to wear and not too heavy. High quality ribbed ribbon ties and nice saturated color.  Was a bit large for my 11 year old but would fit an adult fine.,1
3,"I have found the bracelets from this brand to vary in quality. I have one that I wear almost daily, but I returned this one because it was strung very loosely and the elastic didn't feel as robust as in the other one. However, the stones are always high quality. I still recommend this brand, even though some bracelets are made better than others.",0
2,"Well, they are warm, but the lining in each finger makes them feel like little individual sausages and make it frankly hard for my fingers to bend. I need gloves I can use my hands in; these aren't keepers for me.",0
5,Great gift for HP fans!,1
3,"The mask fit a kid's face very well however, the features are disproportionate.  The nose is obnoxiously big.  Listen, I know Mario has a big nose, but its outrageous when its placed on a normal size head.  The proportions of this mask can be scaled down by 50%.  If you want Mario's mouth to be where your kid's chin is, this is the mask for you.",0
3,I like the trim design,0
4,I bought this as a gift for a friend.  I didn't read the entire description prior to purchasing.<br /><br />I was looking for something with a fox on it.  I loved this since it had the celtic knot on it as well as the fox.  It was the perfect gift for my friend so she would remember her (Irish) Fox friend (it is a Wood Badge Boy Scout Patrol thing).<br /><br />She opened the gift and LOVED it until she turned it over and another friend noticed it said FERN on it.  Then we laughed about online shopping when I told her I only looked at the picture prior to buying it.,1
1,Terrible,0
5,"A very nice wooden wand that I bought as a gift for my daughter, a Harry Potter fan.  It's sturdy, nicely carved, evenly stained.  We are very happy with it.",1
1,I barely had these shades for 30 days and the entire hinge and arm just fell while walking in the mall. I was actually satisfied with these until that happened,0
5,Beautiful and reliable time piece very please.,1
2,Nice print...material was okay...but size very small,0
5,"Very nice  purse, very soft nylon, inside and out, easy access to items, also very light weight to carry, will order again. love the color & price. husband bought for me,",1
5,So I'm about 5'2 and knew that the dress would go a little below my knees after reading reviews and past purchases of some maxi dresses that were actually too long for me.  I love it! The medium is great for me and I didn't expect the material to be as soft or thick.  I thought it would be thinner and more cheaply made but had to try and I'm so glad I did.  Will be purchasing other styles!,1
4,"Cute, but arrived with no Backings attached, not okay.",1
5,"I wear this band at least six days a week. It‚Äôs comfortable, nice price, quality seems nice, a good by. I would recommend.",1
1,Watch face to hard to read. No sense in wearing it. Return,0
5,Really like the ring!,1
5,Comfortably to wear and love the looks,1
5,Very nice belt looks expensive and very good packaging,1
2,Is too tight for like ordered a large. Size up to 1x would have been great. Runs way small.,0
5,I'm a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan and wanted to subtly support my team in something work appropriate. This was comfy and cute!,1
2,Look good at first . Got it for my girlfriend for a wedding. But when it arrived noticed the ribbon that it was glued to was uneven and the flower was not glued to the center of the ribbon. And the glue isn‚Äôt hidden very well . It‚Äôs very noticeable.,0
5,Daughter loves it!,1
3,The color is not rose gold. It's more like a yellow gold with a faint hint of rose. The clear stones are unnaturally large. These are unique earrings and aren't terrible to look at so I gave them 3 stars rather than 2. Just don't expect them to look like the picture.,0
1,"I bought for a vacation, used it once and the strap literally broke off after 2 hrs.  So sad because it was super cute",0
1,Totally mis-sized!,0
5,"So cute<br />  Love dinosaurs, not see through, hood push up for chest area.",1
1,I would not buy again. Runs very small and material isn't the strongest.,0
5,This item is exactly what I was looking for. The belt is a little over size but as per the directions a pair of scissors quickly corrects the problem. The belt has no metal which is perfect for my zinc allergy and security at the airport.,1
5,It‚Äôs a beautiful watch. I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for a Christmas Gift,1
1,Junk.,0
3,Very nice quality but they run small,0
3,I bought this to use as a carry-on. It's a bit smaller than expected so I use it as a travel-purse. too small to pack clothing for a weekend trip.,0
4,Fun and sassy. Fits a little big.,1
3,"Good Strap. Its thicker than normal nylon NATO straps. The only thing I don't like is that the holes came out of the box frayed. Not too big of a deal considering the durability of the strap. Good company, I would buy something else from them.",0
5,I bought these for my granddaughter. She loved them.  The shoes are beautiful. I bought the pink and gold. Very happy with the shoes.,1
2,"It looked nice on the model, but it was not what I expected when I tried it on. The shorts I got were not what I initially purchased",0
2,"Just bought these about 2 wks ago, and there‚Äôs already a hole in them  that I didn‚Äôt make by snagging it on anything, and there‚Äôs lots of pilling of the fabric already, and I haven‚Äôt washed them once! Finally, they‚Äôre suppose to work while using your cell phone, but they only sometimes do (very inconsistent.) I‚Äôm bummed to have to return them because they‚Äôre nice and warm. I would NOT but these!",0
2,Three different XLarge Jack Smith sweaters. Two fit fine but this one has to be returned because it is too small.,0
4,Maybe not the best costume for trick or treating when it is cold because of the fan.,1
5,Love it!,1
1,"The reviews on this product were misleading- they were a good reason that I bought this. It was said that, if the tiers don't fall where you want them to, then you can hike it up. That's true, however, it makes the petticoat significantly shorter, too much so! I am 5'1 and this was still too short. The first tier begins way too low and begins abruptly, without a transition...so I looked like an upside down tree. It was not flattering at all. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless that's the look you're going for.",0
5,"The black which I got is what the watch should of came with. It flows just right and feels comfortable. Not hard to get use to as well, easy on and off.",1
1,Not meant for a long torso and the back was definitely cheeky. Returned simply for that reason. Front was cute but back was was too much,0
1,Cheap,0
5,Excellent quality. I buy alot of Gerber products. I am always happy with their products. It is just a bit too big,1
5,"Cute dress! I love that it was knee length for me. I got a large, and I am 5 foot 2 inches, 140 lbs. Perfect for either spring or summer.",1
1,"seller did indicate that the item was 'Japanese' fit, but I did not expect it to fit a small child. Additionally, I have had problems attempting to return the item.",0
1,This item is not what I expected.<br />The picture is a little misleading in my opinion,0
2,Seams started seperating within 2 weeks so bern hand sewing back together as needed,0
5,"great quality, arrived on time",1
5,"They fit well, very nice looking on, and at a VERY reasonable price!",1
3,Cute but falling apart already.,0
2,way too large. sent back.  The look was nice,0
5,These are super stretchy and comfortable while still supporting the girls! Absolutely love! I‚Äôm a size 40 D  and ordered an XL and they don‚Äôt pinch or roll into my sides like my other sports bras do. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
5,Lovely bracelet.  Very elegant in appearance.  Its a solid silver in color.  Built pretty thick.  It appears to be very durable.  I wore it to work and had no issues. I dont have charms on it yet but its very pretty as a stand alone piece.  It did not discolor my arm.<br />I was given a discount for my unbiased review.,1
3,There's no stretch to this dress. I was hoping I can squeeze myself into it. It didn't happen lol. It's an ok shade of pink.,0
3,Returned.  Not a good fit for me.,0
5,"Soft shirt and great detachable cape. Velcro pieces are well sewn on each side of the garment and places so that he could put the cape on himself if he wanted to. Nice length to the cape and did not shrink in the wash. The faces of the paw patrol characters are made of thicker vinyl-like material that makes the shirt hotter on the inside, but the faces are small and spaced well enough that it doesn't hold in a lot of heat and make my son sweat as much as other character shirts printed with that material vs screenprinted directly into the shirts. My three year old loves it.",1
5,I feel in love with this his purse in the store but it was not the right color. I needed it in a few days to go to a ball. I received it in perfect condition and it was well made. it matched my rhinestone shoes perfectly. Also I must add that I paid less for it compared to the store's price. I found the size to be perfect to fit my phone and lipstick with room to spare.,1
5,"My sister loved this gift, very delicate though",1
1, ,0
3,"Okay so when it came it looked pretty much like the picture. It also came pretty fast. But it didn't fit my ear at all, my sister bought the exact same one and hers didn't fit either. It was a major disappointment... I dint recommend buying this, unless you have very s small ears.",0
5,I knew what I wanted & went in search of it.  It arrived in perfect condition & is exactly what it is represented to be!,1
1,"These are just what I was wanting and hoping for. Great price. Hopefully they will hold up after washing. I'll update if they don't.<br />Update: Ok, these just lost their rating. I've had them approximately 5-6 months now and I don't wear them every single day because I have a lot of socks but the seams are separating now and they are developing holes. Also the top of them where you fold them down is getting very stretched out and I do NOT roll my socks together. I put them side by side and fold them in half so the 'stretching out' of these socks is due to poor quality. I will be purchasing the original 'gold toe' socks that I usually buy from a department store (Bealls) from now on. I've had that brand for several years and they are still holding up. No holes and no fraying of the seams. Very disappointed with these socks at this point.",0
3,Came with a stain & is not nearly as dark gray as pictured.,0
2,Did not expect a dress after even paying 15 to ship fast.,0
5,"Pippen, best ever in the NBA, the shirt is pretty good also.",1
5,Great  shirt,1
1,Too long & wide looking.,0
2,"This was my 3rd time to order this. Based on the sizing information, I ordered 2 pants at size16 and they were too huge. Returned them and ordered 12, again returned for same reason. Size 12 still won‚Äôt fit. Now, I ordered a 10 because I really like it for its softness and warmth. I‚Äôm traveling soon to Central Europe and I need warm winter clothes.",0
3,It is very small and thin not what I expected it would be in the picture lovely if it was more bigger and thicker,0
5,They do what they are supposed to do,1
1,bad,0
2,Definitely meant for someone with baby ankles. This was way to small for my roommate.,0
5,"Perfect for when I need strong magnification, but slim lenses I can tilt my head down to look past. Easily switch from close-up to normal vision.",1
5,It's good and very comfortable the design is great I recommend it,1
1,at first I loved this wallet. But I've had it 2 months and it falling apart already. The liner inside the card slots gets stick to my cards and is now pulling out.,0
1,This dress is literally so far off of the actual picture it‚Äôs ridiculous - returning this today!,0
4,"Good quality.  Love the functional drawstring for the shorts.  Runs small to size - my child typically wears size 4/5.  I ordered a medium, hoping for some growing room ... but, fits just right now without room to grow.",1
5,"Fast shipping, fits excellent...",1
3,"It's okay, but I'm returning it due to the flimsy zipper I'm afraid will break on me.. or the fact it bubbles above my butt because my butt is somewhat big, lol. I also wish the jean quality was nicer, but hey, you get what you pay for.",0
2,Constantly a tangled mess,0
4,I am recuperating from a fractured shoulder and this is the perfect shirt for me now.,1
5,The only thing I don't like it don't have Michael Kors on the band.,1
1,"The picture shows a nice silver zipper with pull tab.  Not what you will receive!  You will get a cheaply made top with a cheap copper zipper (no pull tab) and copper studs. and make sure you size up at least 2 sizes, sizing up one for me wasn't enough. I will be returning it!",0
1,"I wear  a 9M, but even the largest size was too short in the toe.  Just not a comfortable fit for me.",0
3,"I would say I love it, but the color blend everywhere.",0
5,I just love this Y!z0,1
1,"This is not the flowy, long cover up depicted in the photo. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and it hits right at the knee, the sleeves are narrow and short. Material feels cheap. So disappointed. :(",0
3,The outfit is too cute and made well!  However it does not fit right.  First it's a 2T and my daughter has just started to be able to wear it.  In other brands she is in 4T.  The chest and waist fit however the neckline is way too loose and the paints are a little long.  My daughter is in the 50 percentile of height and weight and this is not a common problem.,0
3,Heavy cotton and runs very small.,0
5,"Awesome, it takes a bit to adjust the tension but after experimenting it worked great.",1
2,Fits true to size. The material is very soft but the sleeves are an awkward length. The color of the pineapple on the shirt is more of a tan color rather than a pale yellow.,0
5,I finally found the perfect earring for my tragus. The flower is so small and delicate. I got the 8 mm and it was perfect.,1
5,"Bought for my twin niece's for the winter to run around in. On the larger side, but that means they'll grow into them",1
3,These earrings are pretty but too small for me! The product did have a picture of the size of the earrings but I didn't realize they were so small! The seller was wonderful to work with and refunded me after I sent the product back! I love that they give you a map of where the turquoise came from and a extra package of free backings to the earrings.,0
5,"i knew it was small when i ordered it, but i still wish it was a little bigger. it was the perfect gift for my niece, and she loved it.",1
5,"I recieved this product for free as a review this was a very nice fitting pants ,size was just perfect...my daughter loves them & she says its the best pair of stretch pants she has.i wash them over & over & they go back to the original fit..and hasnt gotten no holes in them.thanks great productüòÉ",1
2,"It is pretty and soft and if it wasn't so small I would give it 5 stars, I would definitely size up if you are thinking about purchasing this",0
3,"Super cute, got tons of compliments when the lights were lit. Fit was great, put on over clothing, wasn't constricting at all. Battery pack over heated very quickly, the mechanism not the actual batteries. I brought extra batteries with me to change them out. The battery pack just wouldn't last more than 15 minutes before getting too hot to function properly, and then turned off. Had to wait for it to cool off before it would come back on.",0
1,I ordered this suit for my  husband and it was not good. This suit is paper thin!!!! It looks cheap not worth buying.,0
5,Wasn‚Äôt sure I would like but did. Very flattering and worked well for wedding I attended.,1
3,"It's a nice dress, but the colors look nothing like it do online.",0
3,"WAY too small! I would definitely advise anyone to SIZE UP! I brought the 8/9size, and my daughter is 7yrs old and it‚Äôs small will not be able to wear it next year it‚Äôs a super cute design and color but the shorts are super tight and hike up, the top fits okay but still too snug.",0
5,LOVE these boots! They're comfortable enough to walk in ALL day and I get complimented every time I wear them. They're super high and look great with skinny jeans or more casual with boot socks. I can't say enough great things about them!,1
5,Beautiful ring . Came in a nice jewelry box. Perfect for a stackable,1
1,Not for big gils. I am a size 3x I ordered size 4x and still was small. If the bottom part would have stench then it would have been ok. JUST ok.,0
5,I ordered tis in a large the fit is nice - will reorder more,1
5,"These socks came right on time, mom is going through treatment and we were looking for something to keep her feet warm and to protect her from sliding while she gets up in a hurry for the restroom.  We love them",1

5,Comfortable and good looking,1
2,"I have 32 DDD boobs, and I ordered a large. This top wasn't wide enough to cover my chest, my girls were trying to fall out. It was also very faded looking and cheap feeling. Which I kind of expected, but not to that degree. I don't think this is really intended for large breasted girls.",0
5,These earrings are simple and nice. I just needed an earring for my uniform everyday and this fits. I will buy different sizes in the future if necessary.,1
4,"Amazing quality, heavy and great details. Our fantasy winner this year is an Eagles fan so the green stone option is perfect. Love that it has the date on it. Also comes with a sturdy little stand. Only downside, no box.",1
2,I really like the Damascus but the handle leaves a lot to be desired and the sheath is very cheap,0
5,"This ""Anti Hero necklace is one of a several. It happens this one is easier to read than many. My 18YO grew up on TS and loves her music. She is in college and wears the necklace. Frankly, I was worried that she wouldn't wear it out and about in a college setting. The metal is heavier than I thought, but we will see how long it keeps its luster. The finish is in between matte and shiny--just right. Great gift now that tour is coming up!",1
5,perfect,1
5,it came quicker than expected and the quality is really nice! i bought it as a gift and my friend loves it. the price is reasonable too!,1
1,Mark on front of shirt,0
5,Perfect for safely polishing my silver jewelry. Love it!,1
3,"The product itself is effective, and overall it is ok.  The delivery however, that is another story altogether.<br /><br />Due to the order and delivery date occurring on a weekday I opted to have it delivered to my office, as I have with all of my online orders in the past.  However this time it was not as expected.  The delivery service that was chosen went to the correct floor in my office building, but they chose to just leave the package on the floor in front of one of our secured doors, one that was NOT the delivery entrance.  Instead of looking for the right doorway, which was the only other one available, they chose to leave it out in an unsecured location where it could have been picked-up by anybody, anyone but me since it wasn't on my actual floor.<br /><br />Hopefully this message will help the product provider(s) to ensure the delivery services they use actually do what they are paid for and do not risk losing a product.",0
5,I wish there was a little stretch material in here as the dress bottom slides up when you sit but it‚Äôs a totally cute dress and very sexy! I‚Äôm a mom and I like that it‚Äôs flattering and fits well in the right places,1
1,The pack that came was not the one in the picture and was very small,0
2,"This heel looked great  just like the picture, but I had some space in the back heel area. I knew if I wore them for to long I would have a sore on the back of my ankle.",0
3,"The  ring was supposed to be a size 12, but it was closer to a size 10.  Made it China, but leery about the size.",0
3,Beautiful soft and warm just too small. I couldn't close it or else it would be too tight to move around in. I'd recommend ordering a size up.,0
1,kind of cheap looking poly material.  it fits well but after washing it the end threads were totally destroyed.,0
4,Loved these. Definitely worth the price. Cant wait to see them on our little one.,1
5,"I actually bought this hat because I am a USAF veteran. I served in combat, the cold war era, and in peacetime. I feel like I already did my part to make America great. Overall the hat does not disappoint.",1
1,Very horrible buy! They don't fit like the pic at all. To much work to put on,0
1,Poor quality,0
3,My husband says they help his headaches from. The sun but the metal leaves marks on his nose,0
2,Tight arm holes and it pulled. Too uncomfortable.,0
1,too thin cheap had to toss it out.,0
5,Wonderful soft pj set!! Loved them!,1
5, ,1
5,Very Cute and Unique :),1
3,It was okay. The colors just looked old. It was just okay,0
2,El cocido mal hecho la hebilla mal hecho no hay calidad en el detalle horrible,0
1,This was not worth purchasing! The sizing was way off! The 2x/3x was more for a medium build person! Very disappointed!,0
2,Se le cayo la piedra la segunda vez que me la puse De la nada sin ningun golpe ni nada,0
4,"Excellent product, but instructions should be provided with it.  It took be a while to figure it out.  The instructions on the Amazon web site are too small to read or see.",1
5,"Great dress for the price - I got a ton of compliments on it, and it wasn't too long (I'm pretty short).",1
1,Poor quality. Broke first time I put it on,0
5,"Weii made, quickly shipped.  Love the bright blue color.  And they clip on.",1
5,I Am Very Satisfied With My Order,1
3,Good buy if you have smaller kids you'll get more use.,0
4,"I loved this little item.  It is very attractive and durable and a great gift for anyone.  I needed a bigger one and, in a hurry, didn't look closer at the measurements.  I needed one that was 3 inches, not 3 cm.  The seller should write the measurements in the most popular forms, which are Metric AND U.S. Customary.",1
5,"I first saw this GShock reviewed favorably in Men's Health magazine.  I adore new gadgets but hesitated... did I really need a new watch??? Well, this one has four outstanding features that attracted me: 1) It's solar powered - never buy another battery again  2) it's atomic - receives a signal so you'll always have exact time!  3) world times are automatically configured from your home location  4) it's waterproof, attractive and vitually indistructable.  I read some people had trouble synching the watch... but I followed the instructions and it works brilliantly, especially at night.  It's fun to see my watch and atomic desk clock in perfect synch.  I think of home when I'm away and my heart skips a beat.  Not bad, if you're sentimental like me.  I LOVE THIS WATCH!!!",1
2,Weird fit,0
3,It's cute but very thin material.,0
5,This dress is beautiful!,1
3,It was lovely for a while until the bottom fell off and the light no longer works. No worth the money I paid.,0
1,The picture the seller has up is completely misleading. You can‚Äôt even tell it‚Äôs a sheep. Note the scarf/mask is almost two feet long so when scrunched up around neck you can‚Äôt tell what it is. And to top it off...it took about two months to arrive.,0
3,I wear it every day,0
5,"I have gotten so many compliments! This scarf is soft and cozy. It took me a bit to figure out how to wear it, but now it's a staple. Also works great as a nursing cover when you forget your normal cover. Definitely buy this!",1
3,"I loved the dress, BUT as soon as I opened the package there was an overwhelming perfume odor. Had to return unfortunately.",0
2,"the open mouth may have led some people to  think that it was  hinged, this is not the case, it was clear from the pictures that there was no hinged mechanism.  this dissapointed the recipient who is now looking forward to destroying the thing that was bought as  a base  for modification.  i did not promise my ""furry""  much, but they feel violated, and, the latex, smelled funny.",0
5,"This pendant has a nice long chain with about 2 inches of adjustment available. The clasp seems to be well made and should stand up to lots of hooking and unhooking. The front of the leaf has a dimpled surface with the veins of the leaf detailed, and the back has a brushed metal appearance. it's nice and shiny and has a yellow gold color.<br /><br />This necklace and pendant are really versatile. You could wear it with jeans and a t-shirt, a fancy cocktail dress, or go hippie chic with some earth child clothes. It could even work as part of a Lord of the Rings elf cosplay. Basically what I'm saying is that you can wear it everyday.<br /><br />Cons: None really. It is cheap costume jewelry. I wouldn't buy it for your wife or girlfriend when she's mad at you, or bury it in a vault to trade for water after the apocalypse but for what it is, it's perfect.<br /><br />Disclaimer. I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />[...]",1
5,I like the quality and the color.,1
4,"This was purchased for my 5 year old son and he loves it. It was a little tedious to set it, but on a positive note, it will make it hard for my son to accidentally change the settings.  My son loves Star Wars, especially Kylo Ren and loves that it is digital so he can tell time easily and he also says he loves that it lights up.",1
5,Total fit of product,1
3,"The item should becalled top or tunic, but not dress. It's very short.",0
4,"Love the hat. Not a pink as it is shown in picture more earthy tone. I have large head, so its really tight on me.",1
5,All appear function and of fairly good quality. Worn one with a gemstone pendant and it held up and looks good.,1
5,Nice wallet. I would buy it again.,1
2,"The tie was in good condition but not what I wanted, quality wiser. I needed a little bit higher quality but I wasn't willing to pay more. It was perfect for the price, if that makes sense.",0
4,Yes it's thin and not great quality but I like it. I don't like having thick bulky scarfs around my neck so this one is perfect for me.,1
5,My girlfriend is a huge Bojack fan and the shirt fits her very well. She loves it!,1
3,They are Stunning  but runs about 2 sizes to  small.,0
3,"The are not water-proof. I spent 2 days in the snow and on the 2nd day, my hands got wet. Perhaps I had an opening at the wrist. They are just ok, but I will be looking for a different pair for my next snow trip.",0
1,"The navel ring is very pretty, however, the ""14k gold plating"" is a joke. It started peeling on the ball and the entire part that connects to it completely. I don't believe it's made of stainless steel for a moment. I am very sensitive to cheap jewellery, and wearing it caused an infection after two days, so now I can no longer wear it. It would be nice if I could just return it, but alas, life happened, and the 30 day return window closed, so in the garbage it goes. What a complete waste",0
5,Such a beautiful piece of jewelry. Well made and vibrant colors. Can be worn as an everyday piece or to accent more formal attire.,1
5,"I‚Äôm wearing this for my anniversary dinner. It is so gorgeous. It hugs my curves and fits well. I love the sparkles and the color. I also like that you can adjust the dress with strings on the side. Overall, this is a classy but sexy dress that will surely make you stand out wherever you go in it! I would buy it again!",1
5,I have never gotten so many complements!  From complete strangers both men and women and of all ages! SCORE!<br />  I love this dress will eventually get all the colors.  great for work and summer wear.,1
1,"I thought ""oversize glasses"" would comfortably fit over my prescription glasses but not so. Returned for a full refund.",0
3,"Amazing, glow in the dark, but a little bigger than expected",0
2,Basically a knock off. No luminous emblem,0
4,Classic MK look. Well made and I am able to throw them on with any outfit for a quick change. Arrived with a scuff. No other complaints :),1
5,Love it,1
3,"The is the best cashmere wrap for the money. I have bought several. Warning: the dark brown is really a toffee color. I did not have any scarves that color, so I kept it. They are thick, comfy and will keep you warm too.",0
1,They had a very horrible smell to them and I even ordered 2 sizes bigger and they were way to small.,0
5,"Thank goodness for Amazon! This dress came just in time for my event and it fit perfectly. I'm US16 and the XXL fit with no issues. I received multiple compliments as well. The lace is soft not itchy.<br />Note:<br />*** If purchased, watch out for anything that came grab on to the lace like keys/key rings, hang nails, door knobs, car doors, zippers on purses, wood, etc. YOU CAN GET &#34;CAUGHT UP&#34; QUICK! lol",1
5,The perfect gift. This was the birthday girls favorite gift!,1
1,It only lasts one wash. The zipper on the back also doesn't help the kid to remove it by themselves. The hat waa badly sewed. Hides the kid's face. Do not recommend.,0
5,"These are a tiny bit smaller than the last ones I got but I love these even more, the really hug your ears and they are extremely well made!",1
3,"I ordered these thinking I would try out the seamless look. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 130 pounds and ordered a small. Somewhat athletic build but thicker thighs. These have a ton of compression in the waist but none in the lower abdomen ‚Äúpooch‚Äù area, which bask at pushed all that area down making me look very bloated. Color was true to the picture, but overall not a good look.",0
2,I am 5'3&#34; and the blouse covers my thighs.  Very long but good for a very tall person.  I don't want to take the time to return it.  I will pay for it and give it to someone who can wear it.  Thank you.,0
5,"Received this as a gift. Love it. The chain is okay, but I took the pinecone off and strung it on a gold chain. The workmanship is great.",1
1,I ordered a small the item was too large and I was only sent the shirt not the whole outfit as advertised and the color was way different then what I picked out and paid for i definitely give this a zero stars if I could,0
1,This came in a super ornate diamon shaped sparkly box. Inside was a tiny plastic bag and the pendant in yet a tinier plastic bag (so tacky!) but the worst was that it looks nothing like this smooth heart shape - it looks hammered out and warped all over. Looks more like a pretzel than a heart. VERY disappointed.,0
5,Cute print! I read some reviews and decided to size up .. and it fits great.,1
3,Runs really small compare to US sizes,0
1,"This dress is okay...I didn‚Äôt mind the cream slip, but the dress was super dirty at the bottom and the sleeves were completely different sizes (one arm fit nicely, one arm had at least an 1 inch of excess fabric).",0
4,"My wife says her legs feel much better after wearing these compression hose. They took a little getting used to the first time wearing them, but she quickly appreciated how they made her legs feel. Eased leg pain. We'll give them more time before her final assessment.",1
1,"These are really poor quality. My son wore them twice and they already started coming apart around the toes. While I didn't expect them to last more than the summer, two days was really not worth the price.",0
3,Too much boning - i gave it to my sister,0
2,"I had a feeling that the fit would be iffy because these are legit denim jeans. That means they have no give/stretch with sizes small, medium and large. I ordered a medium at 5'5"" and 140lbs. They were snug in the wast meaning that I would size up however they were extremely tight in the bum area too (I dont really have a big bum lol). Where they were snug in the waist the crotch portion just did not sit where it should which made the jeans uncomfortable. I think it is a hit or a miss it just depends on your body",0
3,"Can anybody tell me how to set the watch, digital time and date.  Don't have any instructions.  Thanks",0
5,"The dress was perfect for a wedding I was in.  The material was a little thicker than most of my maxi dresses, which I liked. Ran true to size for me. I will probably buy again in a different color!",1
5,Great product. My daughters loves them! Great price.,1
2,"I returned this, a medium would fit a 6 yr old an no larger size avaible",0
4,I like it!  My niece will love it!,1
5,"Very cute dress, soft material, good quality material, not too thin, not too thick & good length.  I bought the L and it fit pretty close to as expected but you think it's going to look like the model pictured. :)",1
1,Product did not fit .,0
4,"If you are looking for a high quality nose ring, these are not for you. If you are looking for pretty nose rings to change out for fun, these are for you. The part that goes through your nose is very thin.",1
3,The dress is really pretty. Not thrilled about it being polyester but still nice on. It was too big so I had to have it altered,0
5,"The bag & lunch bag combo is very soft, super cute and it is perfect for school kids. The side sleeve in the bag has the same pattern inside of it, which is really nice. Only drawback is the two water bottle sleeves that is not elastic (Your space for water bottle is restricted). But other than that, it looks perfect!! In love with it ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
4,"I bought this dress to wear to a birthday party. I wanted to look nice but still be comfortable. I also wanted a dress that I could wear with a flatter healed sandal . (Sadly my high heel days are over). I washed it before I wore it. I did not put in dryer just in case. It air dried quickly. I put in dryer for 2 minutes just to soften it up a bit. Came out perfect. I wore a nice statement necklace and earrings. I received many compliments throughout the evening . I think this dress was definitely worth buying. I am 165 pounds. I ordered xl just in case( hate tight fitting clothing) but I definitely could of ordered the large, no problem. If I ordered another I would do that. But lovely non the lessüòä",1
3,"OK.  Does the job.  Compact.  I prefer more cotton blend.  Color is more like cream, not pure white.",0
5,"We just returned from vacation, had a great time! I purchased these luggage tags because on our last trip our bags and tags were demolished by the airline! We got new suit cases and these tags. They are AWESOME! They hook on nicely so you can see the bright colors coming down the luggage carrousel. No rubber ties or strings, the metal ring hooks tightly and stays in place. I am ordering more for my travel friends!",1
5,Still my favorite necklace,1
2,"Problem with Nike is the sizes seem to be always a half size too small, and to narrow.  When you adjust to get a pair to fit, then they seem to big and wide.",0
5,Great fit !! Love the shoes,1
3,Came broken/missing a ring for one of the straps to attach to.,0
3,"I was drawn to this by the price, the lovely color and the promise that it was made of bamboo.<br /><br />My first purchase was a large.  I have never known anyone with a face that big.  It had to be returned.<br /><br />My second purchase was a medium.  While it was a better fit, the cut was not as comfortable as I was hoping.  The material was also not as breathable as I expected.  That one had to be returned as well.<br /><br />Despite everything this mask has going for it, I doubt that I would purchase it again.  However, I would recommend that other people give it a try.  I have a feeling that this is one of those products that will work well for some people even though it is not so great for others.",0
4,"For the price these are very cute, I bought 2 pairs for my 3 year old twin granddaughters and they love them. I like the nice flat rubber sole because there is no slipping on the hardwood floors.",1
5,"Great wallet!  Nice leather, well made, lots of slots for cards.  Only issue I have is that the color GRANITE was what I thought to be gray, but it's actually a milk chocolate brown color, and the hardware on it is gold, not silver, which is what it appeared to be in the photo.  Was looking for a gray with silver hardware, however, this ended up matching the inside lining of the purses I bought, perfectly!  Also, it's a fairly standard sized wallet.  It has two snaps on the outside so that you can choose which snap to use based on how full/thick your wallet actually is once you get everything put in it, so it's expandable and can still be snapped closed.  Nice design and good quality!",1
5,Impecable todo!!!,1
5,"This bathing suit is so cute in person. I'm plus sized, normally wear a 18 in pants, XL or 1X in shirts. I ordered the 2X but received the 3X. I tried it on and it fit very nicely so I kept it. I feel really confident and well covered in this. Would consider ordering the other color available.",1
5,You cannot beat that price. Ive had it for a month or so and its holding up perfectly well. I like it.,1
3,"It's almost like they are made for people that are not in shape yet, because it's like it had like extra room in the gut almost like maternity pants",0
5,great for slip mules,1
1,It is not as described.  It says Pink Satin Ladies not Pink ladies as pictured.,0
3,Ordered for a gift. Did not receive the patterns selected. Seems cheaply made fleece material.,0
3,"I ordered 9 necklaces as gifts for Christmas. They were expected to arrive November 15th-30th, but I actually received them on October 26th. I didn't realize these were coming from China until after I placed the order. Shipping cost less, as they were combined. I ended up getting 2 free necklaces and 3 chinese bracelets. Only 5 gift boxes included. I'll need to purchase 5 more. Although the necklaces are pretty, they do not look like the picture (all 10 I received look the same though). The flowers were a different color and not well bloomed. I am honestly disappointed and will probably gift mine to someone else. Awesome shipping, great price, and included extras (besides the boxes). I'm sure the receivers will be happy as they are unique.",0
2,"The item itself is stunning. Very beautiful. The unfortunate part is that the clasp to hold the cage part together did not work, so I never even got a chance to try it out. I was so excited about this too. I searched for a long time to find the perfect one, and this is the one that spoke to me. But of course, with my luck, it was not meant to be.",0
4,Had a couple stains on the pocket but otherwise very cute and as expected.,1
5,I love this purse.  It's the perfect size and I love the color pink too.,1
1,Bad quality. Not adjustable...too big,0
3,The dress was already ruined.  Before I opened up the package,0
2,Poor quality,0
5,I love my bracelets. I have purchase 5 different bracelets which includes the item I‚Äôm reviewing and I completely love them. Would recommend.,1
5,Style & color,1
5,very comfortable and did the job through covid,1
2,Mine broke after a month...,0
5,Nice shorts! Good quality. Nice length.,1
4,"I love that this athletic, dry-fit shirt comes in a bag. This is perfect for keeping in my backpack as an extra shirt when going outdoors. I like the fabric and the overall fit, but I just wish that it was a little longer. This isn't usually a problem that I have with athletic tops, but this just fits a little shorter. Otherwise, it seems true to size everywhere else. Great quality.",1
2,"it came apart the second time worn, bad quality",0
2,Not what I expected. If you try to organize the cords and small accessories to your gadgets into this &#34;cord roll&#34; they fallout and/or the roll gets too fat and becomes a nuisance in your bag.,0
5,"These are thinner wool sock, but they feel great.  These would work just as well in the boardroom as in the great outdoors!  Great purchase!",1
3,Get a size bigger they dont strech that much,0
2,Received months LATE! The material not quite what I expected.,0
3,"This is one of those designs that is waaaay too long for my 5‚Äô2‚Äù height.  At the price, I‚Äôm using it for PJs",0
1,Huge,0
2,The pink one arrived broken but not interested in returning.,0
5,these were great socks-had to return them due the doctors orders but the people were great and I had no problem. Sorry I could not keep them,1
5,"I'm always skeptical of ordering clothes online, but I trusted the reviews and I'm glad I did!  I usually wear somewhere between a 22 and 24 (5' tall, 240lb), so obviously I ordered the XL.  It fits fantastically.  If you're short, not to worry - it has a pretty long &#34;waist&#34; portion that you can adjust.  The length is perfect, it's just-right poofy, and the lining is really nice as it keeps the crinoline from being scratchy.  HIGHLY recommend - I'll be buying these in multiple colors now that I know how great it is!",1
3,First you see a really nice looking pouch bag. Then you open it and your hit with this horrible smell.  I almost couldn't get past the smell to do this review it was so over powering. The leather feels cheap and rough. The buckle is probably the only thing worth spending your money on. I just can't express the how bad this belt smelt. And how cheap the material felt. Would not buy. I hope this has helped. Thank You,0
2,WAY TOO BIG!  It might fit someone if they were a 300 lb man with a full beard. Very disappointed!,0
5,"I really love this bag. It is just the right size if you are trying to go with a smaller bag, but still have room for essentials. The leather is soft and a very pretty brown. The bottom has little feet on it so the bottom of the bag is not directly on the floor when you set it down. There is also a &#34;stiff&#34; frame that runs up each side and across the bottom giving the bag shape so it does not appear flat. I like this bag so much I am ordering a different style in a dark blue.",1
3,Fit was a bit small and it took forever to arrive.,0
2,"Does not work as advertised, it might reduce some glaring, that is it",0
2,They aren't as the pic shows. Not made of cloth really but some stretchy very thin material.,0
1,Was so excited to put this on and take some pics around the house but the snaps on the muzzle were off mad it look bad kinda to close together and lopsided. Will probably just return it and look for something better.,0
2,Runs small..,0
3,"This is a very nice knockoff ring, very substantial weight and sparkles like its thousand dollar competitors. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of the center stone. The roundness and height of the stone almost makes it look like toy jewelry. I'm not complaining by any means, considering the price and wear it proudly on a daily basis.",0
5,Very pleased with the shirt I love the image. Very happy with purchase cellar,1
1,THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PURCHASE EVER! It looks nothing like the picture. The colors are muted and smeared. I will not  buy again and have told my friends.,0
4,Nice but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the size and it was much smaller than I was expecting.,1
5,"I love Rick and Morty but I'm not a fan of the more ""wacky"" clothing prints available. THIS one, however, is super awesome!",1
4,My wife used this as part of a vampire Halloween costume. Great fit and comfortable.,1
2,"While the fabric is nice and soft, and very pretty, sadly, the other reviewers were correct about the cups and straps : / Have a very small frame, and hoped it might work for me, but no. The bra continually tries to travel north, and with everything else heading south, it is not particularly comfortable or flattering : o",0
5,I like very comfortable,1
3,"This dryer worked really well but unfortunately, one of them quit working after a couple of weeks (good thing it was within my &#34;returnable&#34; date).  I wear a women's size 7.5 - 8, these fit really tight in my size 8 Merrell's shoes and I cannot use them in any other shoes without laces. I didn't even try them in my boots because i didn't see how they would get in there or worse I wouldn't get them out. I think these are made for men's shoe sizes. It's too bad that i had to return them but i will buy them again if they come in a smaller size and I will definitely register them to get the warranty.",0
5,Slim and lightweight. Expensive look and feel. The perfect color.,1
5,Very attractive earring but a little bit heavy,1
5,My son likes the strings and that they are above the knee just right!,1
3,Tight in the breast area the rest of the dress fits like it says. Nicely made material. Don‚Äôt want to return due to the hassle.,0
2,"We ordered thr white pair first and they were amazing so we bought the navy pants. The navy pants came from a different manufacturer, were too small, and then shrunk in the wash. Awful!! We would buy the white pair again, but we will never buy the navy pants again.",0
3,Product looks great. But out of my 4 pairs of sunglasses none of them fit into it. Sad!,0
5,"Fits great. I though I would need some sort of support but I am a size C and it fits just snug enough that no lining is needed. It flares out slightly under the bust, so not a clingy fit. I am 5'6 and the length is as pictured right about at the knee.",1
1,This shirt was cute until I wash it. I don‚Äôt understand how a white shirt look grey.,0
4,"Very nice frames, I'm satisfied with the product.",1
1,Sizing,0
4,"Cheap, novelty glasses. Pretty cool for themes and such. The flag pattern on the lenses really does obstruct your vision more than you would think.",1
1,Poor quality! Poor on the 2nd use.,0
3,"Normally, I wear a size 16 dress, but I've been losing weight, so I had someone measure me to be sure.  Based on my measurements, the size 18 would fit, but I ordered both the 16 and 18 just in case.  The dresses arrived folded in separate sealed bags in one package.<br /><br />I tried on the 16 and it fit beautifully, so I didn't even open the size 18 dress bag.  The material was severely wrinkled and about four or five of the jewels sewn to the dress were loose.  The jewels were both glued and sewn onto the dress, but the threads were very loose and one jewel was hanging by a thread, so I just cut it off.  The design wasn't affected noticeably.<br /><br />Underneath the chiffon material is a moderately heavy lined satin skirt, which was simple to iron.  The material was of decent quality.  As I ironed the chiffon, though, loose threads were quite apparent.  Many loose threads got caught under other embroidery and that's when I noticed that one of the designs was incomplete.  I hoped the lighting at the event would be dim so that nobody would notice.<br /><br />When it came time to put the dress on, the designer's tag was sewn into the side seam of the dress.  I used scissors to carefully cut the ropes as close to the dress as possible.  I found this odd, but maybe it's customary in the country of origin.  The length was perfect.  I wore 2&#34; heels and the dress was a couple of inches off the floor (I'm 5'7&#34;).  Later I switched to flats and the dressed skimmed the floor without dragging.<br /><br />You will need someone to lace up the back and maybe a second pair of hands to help make it tight.  My dress needed tightening half-way through the event.  I wore a strapless bra underneath for support.<br /><br />At the event, I got a few compliments and I just hoped that nobody looked too closely to see the flaws.  I kept the dress because I liked it, but honestly, I may only wear it this one time unless I remove all the jewels.  The next day, after the event, I found two jewels in my car that had broken off of their own accord.<br /><br />Overall, the dress is of moderate quality.  The design on the front is of less than good quality, but from a distance it looks beautiful.",0
5,"I overcompensated and bought a size larger than I needed, but I will still wear it. Very pretty and comfortable.",1
1,"I rarely write reviews, but this is an exception.  The sizing makes no sense, whatever size you think you wear quadruple it and hope for the best. Then if you try to return, expect a response along the lines of ""we are international shipper, it is very expense to return, just keep it and give to a friend and we will give you 10% back"".  Gee thanks",0
2,This shoe hurt my toes and flopped on my heels. Not sure if it was my foot or the shoe but they were returned the next day. Pretty shoes and seemed good quality.,0
5,Warm and fits nicely. Doesn‚Äôt stretch out like most of them do!,1
4,"I really like this jacket, although it is a bit thin",1
5,I would say it runs a little small with little stretch. One had the hem unraveling but they are very cute on.,1
4,"Great comfortably, they look as they do in the photos, I recommend this item to beginners.",1
3,"Good fit good design and good price, but after a month and a half (and I don't even wear it all the time) the hem of the pants is ripping apart",0
4,"I wear a size 10 so if you have feet later than this, like if you wear a size 11 sometimes, these are a pass for you.  Because while these were really comfortable, I felt they were really stretching on my feet.  So, my mother who wears an 11.5 would hate these because they would be pulling on her feet.<br /><br />However, the fabric of the Hissox Men's Women's Cotton Ankle Low Cut Casual Socks is extremely soft and weave is kind of loose so they are breathable. The fabric is also thin, but ""cushion-y"" at the same time.  The light grey is a nice color.  Too bad these didn't come in a pack or 3 or 6.  I wouldn't call these men's socks.  The wouldn't fit a man's foot.  Plus they are really thin and really would not hold to up wear in a man's shoe.  I like these better than the socks I typically buy at a fast-fashion big box store.",1
3,didn't like material & couldn't fit on fingers,0
5,My grand kids loved it,1
3,The material is soft and looks just like the picture but the two thumb holes are very different sizes and it reeked of smoke when I took it out of the package. I‚Äôm not overly disappointed just because of the low price,0
2,It's an alright shirt,0
2,Car decals on pjs are sticky...<br />Laundered & still sticky...<br />Would not let my grandson wear..,0
3,"Granted im a big guy, but the jersey fits way small in the shoulders and belly. Nice jersey but order two sizes bigger for good fit.",0
2,"Very disappointed. Cup size did not fit at all, even though I ordered a similar bra in the same size with a different manufacturer which fit perfectly.",0
5,Cute reading glasses. As described by seller.  Very comfortable to use. It has a light yellow tint on the lenses.  Perfect for reading on phones and other devices.  Love the cars the glasses came with. Thank you for a good product.,1
3,This was a few sizes too small and I had already sized up! Definitely size up several sizes,0
5,"Just the right size so you don't look like you are all shoulders,<br />The Velcro doesn't last as long as I'd like.",1
5,"Bought this because I needed something more substantial for a pendent I bought for my daughter. I was expecting to be disappointed (have bought others and returned them) but this is really so much more than I expected. It looks  delicate but yet it is more than enough for pendent. Was afraid the boxed chain would look heavy - not at all! If you are looking for that chain to hang something from but don't want something that will break easily then this is it. No regrets. I am ordering one for myself because I have a medal and this chain is perfect. Also would like to add that gold color is subtle. (Sorry, just had eye surgery things are fuzzy). In all good conscience would deffinetly recommend this!",1
5,It‚Äôs a beautiful bracelet.  Love it.,1
2,Broke shortly after purchase,0
5,Suggestions for size up was perfect fits just the way I wanted it too!!,1
5,Very easily my new favorite shirt. So soft and is the ultimate just chillin' shirt.,1
5,Super sexy!  I got a ton of compliments when i wore it to the club,1
1,"I ordered it for 9.y.o.boy. He liked the style online. However it was nearly impossible to put them on. When he finally managed to put one on, it was a struggle to take it off. I had a feeling I was going to break his leg when helping him to take the boot off. It was simply ridiculous.  Just a side note-we never, never( !) had such problems before.<br />On top of it there is no fur/insulation on the top of the foot. Only in the shaft and wool sole. I can never understand it. The foot are is the most vulnerable part, why not to put insulation there?",0
2,"I just got back from a few weeks in Italy, gave this bag a work out ! It`s stylish, seems pretty well constructed, but there were things I didn`t like about it : the flap is only held shut by two of those cheap magnetic snaps, that pop open when you are carrying a heavy load in the bag. I passed on buying other bags for the same reason, I thought that strap on the front was functional, it is not, just cosmetic. Didn`t see that in the description, or the photo`s of the bag. Also the shoulder strap is a very smooth material, that tends to slip and get longer with use, and had to be readjusted every couple days. If you are using the bag to carry a very small amount of stuff around, it might be what you want. I was carrying 3-5 lbs. of guide books, tablet, camera, water bottle, etc. at any given time, and had the described problems with this bag. Not the bag I was looking for.",0
5,So comfortable,1
1,Does not lay properly,0
4,"I wear a 8, so ordered a 8.5.  Should have ordered a 9. But, they are very vice shoes. Will be returning them.",1
2,"The description reads ‚Äúslim fit‚Äú but this thing is big‚Äîsuper long, too. It‚Äôs just an average Hanes T-shirt; it‚Äôs thick and scratchy, not soft and fitted. I‚Äôm disappointed in the quality.",0
1,They were for a person with a small head. Or a kid,0
3,"Over all it's a great bag for the money HOWEVER it smells really really bad. We took it out of the plastic bag and whatever coating is on the bag is very powerful. We put newspaper inside the bag to get rid of the smell, it still smells. We have hung it outside for a week and half, it's better but it still smells. My husband even wiped it down like the instructions says to .Hopefully in time the smell will disapate.",0
1,"The picture makes you believe you will receive a cute, classy dress... NOT TRUE AT ALL.  It literally looks like a cardboard box on.  Such a waste of money.",0
1,"A little tighter than I hoped. Washed the shirt one time, and the design almost completely vanished.",0
5,Good socks,1
1,"The watchband is comfortable enough. I believe the pattern was stamped on the flat vinyl band because when I bend to wrap around my wrist, there‚Äôs cracks in the pattern. I do not recommend.",0
5,It‚Äôs great,1
1,This 3x is more like for a medium man size. Not even close to a real 3x disappointing,0
3,"I bought this for my 6 year old, but it was too short for her.  Luckily, it fits my 4 year old pretty well.  It's a great dress for the price, but the sizing seems a bit off.",0
5,"Beautiful,  nice matte design, well made.  Light and true to size.",1
1,Cheap and thin,0
5,Wonderful. Soft and warm.,1
5,"It was a Christmas present and my nephew loved it, yours will be too.",1
5,Just right for me. Lovely. Great value. Thank you,1
3,Had I love my mom on the back,0
3,"Normally I am a 34D so that is what I ordered, however I wasnt even able to bring the sides together to begin zipping up the middle so definitely SIZE UP. Will be returning and I'd like to order one that fits as it seemed a sturdy material but I'm not sure what size I'd be then",0
3,"Good quility, nice and clean cut. Only down fall is at seam where waist is and end of sleeves the fabric at the end curls up. Ironed it but did not solve the problem",0
4,Fit as expected good quality,1
5,Love this outfit to the tee. I am a thick girl! But this outfit hugs my booty  and make me look like a cutie.,1
3,It's longer than expected.,0
5,i ordered this because it was unique and cute. the necklace was not delivered. i contacted the company. they were really nice and sent a new one by registered mail. i appreciated the companies kindness.,1
5,Itz really durable and a great fit.,1
3,"The ring is to bulky, but the necklace and earrings are good",0
2,This is soft with vibrant colors but sheds like crazy and looks like a blanket,0
5,Was the perfect buckle to replace the one on my child's Gizmo Gadget watch!,1
1,Cheap material.,0
5,"The original band on my Fitbit was rubbing my wrist raw and this has been a game changer, especially in the summer. Dries fairly fast, easily adjusts and is easy to install. Will be buying more in different colors.",1
5,"What I purchased this for: bodysuits are amazing! I needed a cute bodysuit that was inexpensive-- and pronto. I looked for a bodysuit on Amazon prime that had sleeves, not a low-back, and with snap-closures. I knew that when I bought a bodysuit that was inexpensive, I was risking the quality. This means it could have been see-through and fallen apart in the washing machine, but no such thing has happened. I RECOMMEND THIS BODYSUIT!<br /><br />What I love: for reference, I am a size 8 in jeans, 29 waist, 5'8, with some chub (meaning that I have muscle but I've got some flab as well-- I'm not athletic). I bought this bodysuit in white and burgundy, but for this review, I'm going to talk about the white one. I was afraid that it would fit tight and that I would need to go a size up, but I bought my typical size-- a medium. The medium fit PERFECTLY. I also worried that the snap buttons on the bottom would be cheap. They're not metal, but plastic, but they snap deeply so they never accidentally unsnap. They don't feel cheap at all. It is a tiny bit see-through, but I own nude bras and that does the trick. Because the back isn't much lower than the front of the top, a bra can be worn without showing. It's also VERY COMFORTABLE. The cut of the bodysuit isn't a thong, and the back doesn't ride up thankfully.<br />It's very flattering. The stitching was high quality, not poorly done.<br /><br />What I don't love: I bought this at a very inexpensive price and with Amazon Prime, so it doesn't bother me that it's a little see-through. Yes, you'll have to wear a bra if you don't want anything personal to show through, but I would have worn one anyways. There are no complaints, honestly. You could spend way more for one from American Apparel, but those also are a bit sheer and I've even noticed rips at the seams of my American Apparel bodysuit.<br /><br />Conclusion: BUY IT! If you need a basic white bodysuit for wearing under slip dresses, with high-waisted jeans, skirts, shorts-- this is it! It's inexpensive, feels high quality and SOFT. You're going to love it. I'm very picky with my clothes and I WILL return things that I do not like, even if just a little. The buttons are effective and never unbutton themselves, they're properly placed so they're easy to snap on and off, it's flattering as the cut is shapely. Great value. Don't doubt it.",1
5,Gorgeous bracelet. I love the genuine semi precious stones that were used to make my new go to bracelet. Thank you.,1
2,"The elastic at the wrist is not covered so you can just see 4 white elastic bands that are very noticeable and do not match the rest of the dress. The cups in the dress are also too small for the slots and since they are a different color from the dress, and its not lined, it looks very cheap.<br /><br />May be good as a Halloween costume but nothing fancy.",0
3,Nice but strap is too short,0
5,great product.,1
2,"These shorts are a great price and I always love a pocket on the side (this one's on the right leg).  They are pretty short waisted, making the correct size seem too small (I'm 5'8"", 165lbs).  The waist band is just an inch-wide elastic inside a much bigger channel.  I never wore them beyond just trying them on, but I feel certain that elastic would twist around easily.  I returned them.",0
3,Good size took a while for delivery,0
1,The picture shows a high waist but it was not high.  Plus it has a thin elastic band that barely keeps the waist up.  No drawstring to adjust so pants don‚Äôt ride down.,0
2,Got a large and is more between small to medium compared to US L. Color matched picture. Fabric seems very fragile and would not put this on a dryer.,0
5,Lovely dress. Will buy again in other colors.,1
1,"These are terrible! I read all the great reviews and got carried away by them.  They are SO HUGE that even a person like myself, who wears considerably large earrings, cannot wear them.  They're just that big. And cheap looking.  The orange color is just YUCK, and the pearl on top is so ugly.  Don't have the time or patience to return it otherwise I would.",0
1,They're super cute and fluffy but the colorful piece where the toes go was super tight like her toes couldnt go through it and made elastic super tight also,0
3,"Great looking frames.  I have a metal allergy and live in a hot climate, so the coating on the frames prevents them from corroding, getting too hot on my face, or breaking me out.  The lens size, bridge and arms are great.  They are comfortable, but slightly heavy compared to other thinner frames.  It doesn't bother me as I only need them for reading and they spend a lot of time resting on my forehead.  Good for the money and classic good looks.",0
3,There was no bracelets! The reason I purchased it!,0
1,I ordered the small - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 135/140lbs. This skirt is just all wrong. The bottom part: the front is shorter then the back - it looks so off & odd. Not to mention that when I put the skirt on - it looked like I should have accessorized it with a set of bag pipes or something. Reminds me of a kilt. This skirt is a NO GO for me. Shape is weird - runs big - doesn‚Äôt flatter - material is way beneath glamorous by any standards. I‚Äôll be giving this one away. I don‚Äôt do returns.,0
3,The dress is beautiful unfortunately it is a bit tight in the bust area. The dress is  a nice length reaching the ankles.,0
3,It's rose gold not gold,0
1,While it‚Äôs a cute romper fits poorly I suggest going a size or two up because the top is loose but the the shorts part of you are a curvy person will fit tight I have thighs and a butt and this fit so snugged in the bottom and loose at the top üòï the material isn‚Äôt so bad I wish it was a more stretchy material would have been better since the size doesn‚Äôt add up,0
3,I like the overalll dress.. but it has pockets (which I love) but I had to pin them together underneath the dress of not it looked like I had bat wings..,0
2,"I love the colors and the fit isn't bad in terms of true to size but the material is flimsy and chintzy.  I wouldn't buy these again although for the price, I can use them up and throw em out and probably get my monies worth.",0
5,Looking for a good belt and a fair price this is the belt for you i purchased this belt and i am very pleased with it going to buy this brand from now on thank you!,1
1,Fell apart within a few days. My daughter prob wore these shoes for maybe a total of an hr in each day and it started to fall apart on day 5.,0
5,I love this bow necklace very pretty!,1
1,Dress is shapeless.  Wide at the bottom. Tight at the top. Bland washed out colors. Not flaterring AT ALL,0
5,Have had many compliments on this ring.  Classy looking and gorgeous.  I don't wear this every day...I switch my rings out to compliment my outfit.,1
5,Love the colors ! fast shipping so glad I chose this seller. Product true to description.,1
5,Like the fabric and fit.  Top doesn't roll and legs don't rise during wear.,1
5,Watch is very nice but I cannot adjust the date because it did not come with the tool for the job.,1
2,Product smells really bad and color fade in your skin,0
5,"Got this for my niece who was born a few weeks ago. Quality is great, no complaints, would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for christian medal.",1
5,"This is an 11 dollar t-shirt that isn't made in the U.S. You get exactly what you pay for and honestly the shirt isn't bad quality.  It is thinner cotton, but all the seams on mine (I ordered several in different colors) all seem to be the same. No one sleeve longer than the other that occasionally results from orders like this.  It's a great casual shirt that can be worn under a blazer/cardigan or by itself.  I usually wear an XL, but based on the other comments ordered 2 sizes up at a XXXL. They fit great! If you want a thick material, perfectly sewn, top of the line t-shirt then go pay 20-25 bucks for one.  This is not that and the people who are crabbing because it isn't high quality, don't seem to understand how cost/quality work.",1
1,"I took this backpack on only two backpacking trips, one 10 mile total and another 16 miles total, and one side of it quite literally ripped to shreds.<br /><br />I only had approximately 25 lbs in it.<br /><br />I definitely won't buy anything more from this brand again.",0
1,"I really loved the fabric and love the colors but I'm 5' 7"" and its just too short.  Another thing I loved, the pockets! I didn't like, for me, it's too tight on my boobs and I'm sure going up a size with not fix it being too short and too tight.",0
5,"They arrived quickly but the necklace that we wanted to go with it, and was suppose to have been delivered but we haven‚Äôt received it yet but have ordered another one so there won‚Äôt be any disappointment for our granddaughter. Thank you for the beautiful design.",1
1,"Any more plastic content and you might as well wear a trash bag instead. Seriously, the poly content is so high, the fabric feels terrible on the skin, it's too stiff, and you can hear every move of it. I've had wrinkle free almost 100% cotton shirts, there's really no need for that much plastic in it. Unless you want to bring the price down. You get what you pay for.",0
2,I wear between a size 4 & 6. I ordered this dress in a 6. It was very tight and constricting. I did not like how the necklace in the back closed either. Returned.,0
2,Very cheaply made. Very thin,0
5,"Nice thick belt. Fit great, can be casual or work.",1
1,"Wanted to have quality ""full waterproof"" pants that were wellade and stretchy. The quality 8 like but the main REASON I bought these was for a full rain like it is today to hike in. They get an F for Failure! Do not buy if as it shows in picture fully submersed In water. I will be returning. False Advertising. Amazon take note.",0
3,"I bought five pairs for my bridesmaids. They are pretty, but three pairs are missing at least one of the smaller white diamonds.",0
5,"Perfect, Perfect, Perfect!!!! I love ‚ù§Ô∏è this dress... I will be ordering all colors",1
5,I really like them a lot!,1
3,These shorts are comfy and durable.  They‚Äôre a little thicker than typical gym shorts- imagine sweatpants thickness but cut 2-3‚Äù above the knees.<br /><br />If you workout in them- their thickness And cotton material prevent them from drying quickly so you‚Äôll be wet for awhile.,0
3,"This helmet liner fits like a really tight shower cap. There is an elastic stretch band that goes around the bottom exactly like a shower cap does. It is extremely tight, and to use I had to cut in a few places to ease the tension. I would have returned, but needed to use immediately.",0
1,"These are NOT linen!! They are some sort of plastic(think outdoor picnick table,table cloth) it arrived with small burn holes in them and looks like they were haf sewn half GLUED together! I know this because they were badly glued on those arts and coming undone!This was a serious scam of selling goods I have ever seen!BUYER BEWARE!",0
5,"Great product, love it.",1
1,"These are beautiful earrings and the pair I purchased were given to my daughter for Christmas. They looked great, but broke the 2nd time she tried to wear them. We would've had better luck buying a cheaper pair at Claire's.",0
5,"Wow! These are some of the most comfortable socks I have ever owned. Really soft. Really nice to wear. And they look great. The kit came with 6 pairs, 3 black 2 gray and one white, and I love them. Really really pleased with this purchase.",1
5,"Beautiful - fits my 43"" tall daughter perfectly",1
3,it is a very pretty blouse but the size is too small,0
4,"The dress fit almost perfectly, surprisingly! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 215 lbs and got a size L. I usually wear sizes 12-14 in dresses. Only gave 4 stars because some sequins started falling off and the slip underneath is very short.",1
5,Me encanta muy adecuado para el verano,1
2,"I loved the dress online but when I received it, it was way shorter than I expected. I am short, 5'2 so I figured I would have a little extra length. I decided to wear it with leggings or a skirt and it will work.",0
1,Did not last more than 5 months.,0
5,Great socks. Use for coed softball. Great look/fit.,1
4,"My almost 3 year old wears size 9, and these fit perfect. She loves shoes, but this is her absolute favorite. The stripes are glow in the dark. It is very easy to clean. However, it doesn't look like it is very durable as the outsoles already look very thin and worn. She's had this for couple of weeks only.",1
3,Its a cool looking shirt but i washed it once and letters started to come off and its not worth the time or effort to send back..<br />Update: i was contacted by the company im sure they wanted to make it right. I appreciate it and it shows they stand behind their product so i bumped up the rating from 1 to 3.. But as i said i dont have time to send it back nor do i care about getting a refund.. Plus the shirts graphic hasnt deteriorated any more and ive washed it several times now.,0
5,Yes. It's a football but it's done great and worth every penny!,1
3,It‚Äôs very soft.  But there is a seam right down the middle which makes it a little unbecoming,0
3,It's not slim. Wallet gets thick very quickly with adding a few cards. Looks elsewhere if you truly wants a slim wallet.,0
1,Fabric was dull and pilled after ONE wash. Don‚Äôt buy.,0
1,"I don't understand why plus size underwear is never actually made for plus size people. If your mons pubis is prominent at all, forget these.",0
4,"Adorable print but I had to return, did not fit my daughter... was too small",1
3,Somewhat small around the chest area feel like it would show nipple if you did wear now show bra along with the romper  even though  it has &#34; built-in bra&#34;,0
5,"There was a delay, I contact the seller, she was great, I got my items next day, t-shirts are beautiful, my daughter was so happy. Beautiful colors,designs, material etc",1
3,It fits well and beautiful but poor and cheap fabric. Very disappointed,0
4,It fit a little bigger than I expected. But looks ok,1
3,The hole where the material crosses in the front is a bit wide.  It looks like the shirt has an unintentional hole in it.  It's okay though.,0
3,Could have made the belt a little longer so that someone with a waist of 38&#34; or above would have had sufficient length without fitting so tightly,0
5,I bought these for my daughter. I purchased the 0-6 month. My daughter is pretty chunky for a 3 months old. The ‚Äúwaist band‚Äù part is snug on her belly. But the foot part is really big. She‚Äôs worn the leggings twice and I have to told them into her shoes. Definitely cute though!,1
1,The inner lining will easily come out and it's impossible to put the gloves on afterwards. It left me stranded at the summit of Kilimanjaro. Do not rely on this glove.,0
1,Looks cheap in person,0
5,Love this dress. So different.,1
5,I have short legs and these pants fit perfect. Sit right at/ slightly above the navel. Can be styled fancy or relaxed. A little bit of heels and you won't even have to hem it.,1
1,Cheap trash. Washed them and every one frayed at the hem. I should've known better. You get what you pay for.,0
5,Great fit . I weigh 215lbs and got a XL. Perfect for cold weather because of the inside lining.,1
5,Fit great. Stretchy. Great for all activities,1
5,Love the material ü•∞,1
3,-fabric was different than I expected. Shiney an stretchy. My daughter currently where‚Äôs a 2T and I ordered 3T-4T and it fit perfect. Still very cute but a little darker than expected.,0
1,Fith like a too tight blouse.,0
5,Beautiful and comfortable.,1
4,Doesn‚Äôt cover breast if you are a D cup. It is a snug fit. Love the look of it.,1
5,Great shirt,1
1,Too fragile,0
3,"Its really nice, just a bit short for my liking",0
3,Well it fit very well when I first got it but it was super wrinkled so I put it in the washing machine and hung it to dry and it shrunk. Now it's skin tight and very see through so I'm not sure how I'll be able to wear it again. The dress is beautiful though,0
3,Really like it but 2 links broke first time I wore it,0
5,My daughter love her outfit,1
2,"I've had some ill-fitting pants before, but never have I tried on a pair that was actually loose in one leg and tight on the other! LOL. With that kind of quality control, I don't think I'll be trying these again... They were soft and warm, so if they still have the free returns option you might try them and see if you get lucky! But be prepared to return.",0
3,"This jacket was much smaller than expected, even though I ordered a larger size than what my son wears. It was also material that was similar, if not the same as, costume material. However, the seller was very accommodating and helpful and refunded my amount of purchase.",0
5,Ibroghter it as a gift for my grand son for Christmas don't know how it fit yet,1
1,The Lettering‚Äôs sloppy!!! The hat itself is poor quality. The snap barely stays closed.<br /><br />Product should be more like $5 because it‚Äôs definitely not worth the price.,0
3,"This is a nice soft shirt- with a very large scoop neck- I think it will be great for workouts- where my sports bra is ok to be seen a bit- it has a nice long length to cover some bum too- might make a cute bathing suit cover up- Maybe if I had really large breast and wanted to show my cleavage this would be perfect-<br />Cute wake and back writing- can be referred to a couple things ! but it is soft-<br />I would probably not have bought this in a store but I had the opportunity to purchase this t-shirt at a discounted cost for testing, inspecting and reviewing. I was not compensated and am not required to write this review. This is my opinion based only on my experience with this product.",0
5,"It feels comfortable, soft, it shows off my body well, it fits well, it's a perfect product.",1
5,I have CATEYES!!!,1
1,I thought this was a cute little chain for a youth boy but it was huge about 4 or 5 in,0
5,"I love this bracelet, have had many comments on it. The only thing that I would change is the clasp, I think I would put a snap on it so it would feel more secure and not falling off or shifting.",1
1,pequeno,0
5,Works better than any ive tried. I had almost given up,1
1,"I got this on 05/24 and initially thought it was well made. Boy, was I wrong. It lasted 19 days...<br /><br />Some highlights of the false information in the item description:<br /><br />1) The band is not leather. I didn't really expect it to be, being that the product is $3... But even so, why lie about it?<br /><br />2) Doesn't glow in the dark as stated in product name & description (which is actually a huge disappointment)<br /><br />3) The ""custom glass"" is really just one of those cheap crystal pebbles that you find in bulk bags at any dollar store. The design is not etched into it, but printed on a piece of paper placed behind it.<br /><br />All this to say, buyer beware... While it's true that you get what you pay for, I do expect some level of transparency on the sellers side, and this is just the complete opposite of what they claim to be selling. It's cheap, wholesale crap. Very disappointed.",0
5,I love my new scope! Perfect for the job!,1
3,"It‚Äôs a very cute top but if you are busty, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. I am a size 32 DDD and I purchased a medium. It does not hug sound the rib cage and I had a nip slip when trying to pull it down",0
5,It was amazing! The other reviews said it was quite crooked but it wasn't crooked for me. Maybe it's because of the delivery services but it was perfect for me!,1
5,perfect,1
5,"Love the color and design of the dress, we all did. Was a hair too big on the chest section but only by a 1/4. We have an 11 yo who is 62 pounds and 53&#34;. Such a beautiful dress and excited to see it worn on the wedding day",1
5,Good material and good print.  Good for gym,1
5,"A decent automatic that keeps time well when you continuously wear it.  If using a watch winder to keep it running, you may still have to reset the time/date after extended periods of disuse.  Though that's not all that unusual with automatics anyway. 5 stars for quality compared to the price.",1
3,"The material is surprisingly stiff / cheap. I was hoping it would be more flowy and comfortable. Also, it‚Äôs tight. I bought it sort large (2xl) so it would just hang off, and it does not do that. It fits more like a large. It‚Äôs prettily designed, however.",0
3,Dress is ok. Definitely nice for the cost.,0
1,Very  malleable. I put the earring backs on and the whole earring just bent downward with little to no pressure.,0
5,Love these boots!  They fit perfect and look even better.  They are comfortable and stylish.  Would definitely recommend these boots to family and friends.,1
5,Absolutely love this bonnet! It's adorable. Used it for a photo shoot. Came out perfect!,1
1,I ordered an XL because I wear a L and didn't know how the clothing run ....shirt is EXREMELY small,0
5,"I love these earrings! They look great with casual and work clothes. They do not look like kids earrings, but are small (dime size) and delicate.",1
5,Great fit. Looks exactly like the picture.,1
2,Nice bracelet but size is for a man. This will fit very few women. It was returned,0
5,Lots of compliments. Comfy stretchy material,1
5,I just ordered another pair for another vehicle i drive. They work great. They are very tight against the sides like someone else said and the plastic is a type that goes right back where it was if you try and bend them. The fix is to use a heat gun first and heat up the arms then bent them out a little.,1
4,size down when you order other than that very good shirt,1
2,The colors were nice and the fabric was soft which is why I gave it 2 Stars. The construction was terrible and the fabric did not hold its shape properly and was extremely thin meaning that I would have to wear a shirt underneath. I returned them,0
2,Dislike! Would have sent back if it wasn‚Äôt a bigger hassle than just keeping it. The color is faded and does not look black and white.,0
2,"I have pretty significant foot swelling. I love the look of the shoe but they feel incredibly heavy to me and that is tough on a sore foot. Also, the heal of the food does not situate so its almost more like a flip flop which will definitely cause those with plantar fasciitis issues. I am going to give them a try but I am not looking forward to disappointment.",0
3,Had to have alterations done. The fabric was thin compared to other suits in this price range. The style was nice but in the areas under the arm and in the lower back it puckered outward. I had to dart the puckered fabrics so that it would lay flat against my skin.,0
2,Dropped my ring on my bathroom tile and it shattered! Looked great until that happened.,0
1,"Picture is pixilated, and the image isn‚Äôt exactly the same as the one shown. It is like zoomed in or spread out. The mouth is HUGE.",0
1,bad finishing,0
5,"cheaply made, but i go through sunglasses a lot. i love the look of these and they fit really nicely.... but you can tell they are not of the highest quality...",1
4,Very soft and good quality shirt. A little small.,1
2,"These shoes look just as described and depicted, PU leather seem to be of good quality.  Unfortunately, just right shoe worked as expected.  Left shoe got stuck on blue light until the battery died, it didn't hold charge after that.  I returned the first pair, bought a replacement pair, same exact problem, left shoe failed. What a shame, I really liked these shoes.  The funny part is that both pairs I got arrived with 2 USB cables and 2 remotes.",0
5,What a lovely pendant! And at such a good price with very fast delivery. It is a nice solid pendant that even has a chain provided. Great buy!,1
5,Cutest baby swim suit. Very easy to put on and off. True to the size! Definitely order more in the future.,1
5,"They are super cute!  And they come with a little bag, they are perfect to give!",1
5,Good purchase. My sister used this for my nieces birthday pictures,1
5,"This boot is gorgeous. It is a little steep, but it is very comfortable otherwise. It is also a little big in the circumference, but I have skinny legs and ankles.",1
2,"[[ASIN:B01NAUGHI2 Manduka Unisex GO Light Mat Carrier Variegated Stripe One Size]]<br /><br />I've been using this for 3 days a week for about 5 weeks before I noticed the seam started separating.<br /><br />The zipper is a &#34;J&#34; or &#34;L&#34; design where it would open partway down the end to make it easier to get your mat in/out. Much better than a top-only design. There is an exernal mesh pocket to hold keys, and a separate carrying handle on one end of the bag to make it easier to grab and go.<br /><br />I'm out of luck because it's a week past my eligible return date to the seller, and Manduka says they won't cover it because I didn't purchase it directly from Manduka.<br /><br />Even though it says &#34;GO Light&#34;, I was hoping it would last longer than 5 weeks :(",0
1,Liked this watch fine until it stopped working after 7 months. Would not buy this brand again.,0
3,5‚Äô6‚Äù 133 lbs. 38‚Äù bust 27‚Äù waist 36‚Äù hips. Medium is wayyy to big.,0
1,Cheap fabric.  At least two sizes too small (and I DID check measurements),0
1,"Toooo disappointing on all levels!!! I ordered M to be on the safe side as the chart showed my size should be S although am usually M so i stuck to M !!!! It arrived kinda tight and the zipper is just there for decoration, it doesnt zip and when it does it rips right after so i have to take the zipper down and up again to try to zip but it rips right after !!! I was soooo excited to receive it and was bummed once i did. I would return it but i dont live in the states!!!  :(",0
3,"Not overwhelmingly in love with these pants.  They are a little too fleecy, thick which makes them kind of bulky on your body.",0
5,Love this purse!!!  Absolutely the right size not too big not too small. Wonderful leather with the right amount of class.,1
5,They are awesome,1
5,"I got a small and it fits but I wish I had gotten a medium so it‚Äôd hang just a tiny bit lower and be a bit more oversized like in the photo. The material is kinda cheap but ok. Fine for the price. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 120 lbs. would have preferred medium.",1
3,"Got a small, I‚Äôm 120 pounds 5‚Äô2 so pretty small, on me this is a very baggy and knee length skirt.",0
5,Really fitting perfectly,1
2,I absolutely LOVED THIS DRESS! UNFORTUNATELY  I have to return it because once I put it on (again) for my main event it **%^$# BROKE! I was so upset!!! It was an hour before the party!!! TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!! After trying this on a few times with shoes/jewlery I thought I had the perfect dress. Had to send back! Would like to re-buy but now that the party is OVER I'm not sure when I would wear this dress..too bad,0
1,This dress fits big even with me getting an extra small. It appears to be stained not that light grey look I was expecting. This makes me not want to buy clothes from Amazon.,0
3,Just ok. The quality is good but it looks cheap. I doubt I‚Äôll ever wear it,0
2,"Fits okay, but based on the condition of the item. It appears to be a used garment. This is based on the pilling on certain spots of the item. Will be sending back as I‚Äôm not paying full price for a used piece of clothing",0
5,Great quality! Happy with this purchase.,1
5,"This coat is fantastic. The outside is heavy and not cheap looking. The inside is soft and the cut is great. Great coat, especially for the price!",1
2,So theyre really comfy to wear however they fell out when I was eating. I'm a little disappointed with how the cap doesn't stay fitted for long as I was expecting it to be a much stronger hold.,0
5,Very good,1
5,I am obsessed with this scrub cap! I tried it on with my mask and i felt a sudden relief behind my ears. It is adjustable and comfortable. I highly recommend!,1
5,"I have been looking for months for something to replace the Cabernet hipster underwear that Dillards discontinued. These are perfect! Nice and stretchy, soft, and have held up well through many many washes. After reading reviews I sized down one size and it was a perfect fit. I have also had zero problems using pantiliners or maxi pads to these. I came back and ordered a second pack within a week!",1
5,Love that the words are grip for walking on hardwood floors.,1
1,"It's very short waisted, almost empire waisted. Even with the wrap belt it did not cover the waist seam. Will be returning",0
5,Liked it,1
4,"The top is very cute and I like it a lot and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it, however the bottoms are not so great for me. But that is okay, I ordered a large set since they don't come separately, and I am a medium in bottoms, so it wasn't anyone's fault, I could just order another set in medium but I don't need it. I wish bikinis had the option to not come as a set so I could get a different size bottom and large but for the same price as a set.",1
4,"If I order a large as a set i want all pieces to be LARGE. Companies keep sending these lil @$$ bras. I had to pull it to the middle to cover my nip nip. If I open the jacket, the other half hanging out. BUT I WOULD ORDER AGAIN.",1
1,Muy peque√±o demasiado,0
1,They broke within a span of 2 wears. Grr disappointed in the craftsmanship,0
4,They're a little bit looser than I thought and the waist is too large but I really like them and they are a good length and good quality material very thin and crispy though.<br />The waist is kinda loose for the weight the pants have to keep up. Aka they kept sliding off me!,1
5,Mine is a much darker muted color. still like it. just be advised you most likely will not get the one shown in the picture. I also changed the necklace cord to hemp and added a bead.,1
3,i found the ring to be a disappointment; it was not as good quality as i expected.,0
5,A great piece of jewelry at an unbeatable price! Definitely perfect for a gift to a father on a budget!,1
5,Wow I was surprised how nice this looks! I‚Äôm so glad I bought it. Buying another color,1
1,The earrings were way to heavy for your ears. They were pulling the holes down.  If you keep wearing them eventually you will never get to wear studs in those holes.  The studs will just go through the hole.  I wish they were lighter in weight.,0
5,They came as expected and I love the variety of the earrings,1
5,Good hose. I am not a delicate lady and I tend to tear hose the first time I wear them. These made through a whole wedding (open bar) unscathed!! Fingers crossed for the next wedding!,1
1,Turned black,0
2,$25?????!!!!!! For what I just got? So so so flimsy and thin. Lol I would feel comfortable buying this at CVS for max $12.,0
2,Ordered perfectly for my body size and so the dress is way too tight around my chest and arms and the material is too stiff and so I can barely move in it! I will probably be donating it!,0
5,My son loves this hat,1
4,Very nice. A little thin. Very pretty,1
5,Very good and easy to install.,1
5,Great coverage and support. I love that the padding is bigger and not those weird circles.,1
3,Was so dirty.,0
5,"Soft, silky and sexy! Love it!!",1
3,Super cute just didn't fit as I expected it to,0
5,very cute...gave them to teen grand daughter and she loved them as part of her steampunk look<br />great addition to the steampunk look,1
5,really well made little card holder. love the color,1
2,This is a very cheap oversized hat. If you have a pumpkin head I'd say go for it. There has got to be a better quality hat for this price. $23 for a hat I *might* wear once is not worth it. Give me a hat I can wear daily and we'll talk.,0
5,Lots of great characters. It was fun to sort through them and pick out our favorites.,1
5,"I love this one! I have always looked for a slouch beenie and couldn't find one,now I have one and it fit very well over my hair and head ..I have very thick hair and it was not hard to get that professional look with it!",1
5,Love em,1
3,These are adorable. A little on the small side. My 2 and 4 year old were barely able to fit them on their heads. They lasted one day and a tea party themed birthday party and started to unravel at the hats edges. But they are just adorable. And not bad at all for the price.,0
3,I bought this item since I think it's cool and fun when I talk to my friends online and take some pics sometimes. however the strap is kinda loose and hard to keep it stay on my head...I think with rubber band and some magic sticker it will be better...maybe?,0
5,"These shirts are the best. They absorb light sweat, are warm, soft, and well fitted so are very comfortable . My new favorite winter shirt.  I hope more colors are available next fall/winter.",1
5,Cute pattern and fit well.  Not all that hard to get on or off.,1
5,I bought this for a puppy so it was a bit large for him so I cut it in half to fit around his neck. I will definitely rebuy again when he grows some more. I‚Äôve already washed it and it has held up well!,1
5,Nice for around the house or running to the grocery store.,1
5,It was a good fit.  Better than I thought.,1
5,complete order,1
3,hard to see hands and one of the hour markers fell off dont know where it is hope it dosent jam the watch.,0
4,"My son has these shoes - they are awesome and we are looking for another pair, however, the price from this distributor (plus over $16 for shipping because the item is listed as weighing over 11 pounds?) is OUTRAGEOUS.  The most expensive off-sale pair of these shoes sells anywhere else for $34, and they go for as low as $28 with free shipping at other online sites.  Ridiculous.",1
3,Did not come with a case. Just wrapped in a nylon,0
3,"Not as Long as it seems. Was hoping it was as long as the one in the movie, and it runs very small.",0
5,"I need a sun hat for Rosacea (no sun), but also uncovers my hair because I also have Psoriasis (needs sun). This hat does both. The only draw back is that the head band only comes in black and it gets hot",1
5,This dress is made well! Great quality! I purchased the solid black one and it is definitely BLACK! Love it. I got the L/XL and it gits my curves like a glove! I'll be wearing it in a music video! photos to come ;-),1
5,Beautiful! Love the pattern and the lanyard is very durable. A perfect replacement for my old Vera lanyard and wallet!,1
5,"Awesome, well constructed, would order again",1
5,"This is wonderful. Cute, durable , beautiful. Genuine 4 leaf clover. Great gift idea!!",1
5,Beautiful and perfect for my grand daughter's 1st birthday party. We loved it. Just a bit long in the arms,1
2,"If you have larger breast and really need support I wouldn't recommend this product.  The material gives allot of stretch so it doesn't really hold anything  in place while running.  If you are just doing weights, or machines this is ok but if you are doing any exercise that makes you bounce you might as well be wearing a tank top with a built in bra.",0
5,Husband loves it!,1
5,"Love the fit and fabric, great pants for the price!",1
3,So cute!,0
4,"It's a cute ring, you get what you pay for though. I don't expect the shiny finish to last for more than a couple months though! :)",1
3,"This Myobe women's crewneck knitted sweater is really cute, but I was a bit disappointed with the sizing.  I normally wear an XL, as I like my shirts comfy but not hanging off of me.  Although it is incredibly comfortable, the material sucks to your body and is a bit small.  The XL states that it fits a US size 12-14, but it's more like a 10-12 -- so it's off by a size or so.  It's very lightweight and wouldn't keep you very warm in the really cold winter weather, but perfect for our Arizona winters.  It's actually quite thin, so you'll probably want to wear a t-shirt or tank top underneath it - because you can sort of see through it.  This is pretty stretchy and has a tiny bit of sheen when I took a picture with a flash, but when seen with your eye, it's a solid brown color with no sheen at all.  I do love the A-line flare at the bottom of it and you could totally dress this up or wear it with a pair of jeans!  There was a snag on the bottom front of my shirt and I'm afraid that if I snip it with a pair of scissors, it will start a horrible unraveling effect that would ruin it completely.  Washing this may be a bit tricky.  There isn't a tag inside mine that states what it's made of or how to wash/dry it - but my guess is that it would have to be hand washed.  It just seems too delicate to throw in with other clothes, but MIGHT work on a gentle washing cycle.  I've gotta say, it's a lot cuter on the model in the picture listing, probably because she's a tiny lady - but it gives me inspiration to lose more baby weight so it fits better.  Overall, it's ok - but doubt I'll wear it a ton just because it was sized wrong and I'm not particularly keen on hand washing clothing items.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",0
1,Couldn‚Äôt return it-tried to file a claim but couldn‚Äôt do that either. Wanted to return for cheap quality and see through.,0
1,It was way too small! The top is very ugly in person. Looks like cheap glitter on it and it really itches on your skin. Hated it and threw it in the trash.,0
4,Comfortable and does the job.,1
5,good comfortable shoe,1
2,Everything seemed fine except my normal XL size was too large to wear.,0
5,I love the earrings that i ordered and received.,1
5,beautiful but very small,1
3,The problem is the quality. It Is just not worth the money being asked. This is like a $15 hat and it is overpriced. The cat on mine is kinda crooked and one of the cats paws is to far out. So kinda disappointed in this purchase.,0
5,"Do great in the washer. I mostly hang dry, but sometimes one makes it into the dryer. I have had them about 6 weeks and They are holding up well with weekly washing. Good coverage. I am very happy with the purchase.",1
5,Awesome,1
3,Good fit. Quality not the best,0
3,"I loved this outfit! the material was nice and soft and my son looked so cute in it, but he was only able to wear it twice because it fit him too snug. I  bought a size he would be able to grow into, but I should have bought 2 sizes larger because it was a small fit.",0
4,My daughter loves them. I'm looking forward to seeing how well they hold up.,1
2,"very cheaply made, fell apart quickly.",0
2,"I ordered 1 of these masks for my 9 year old daughter and she loved it.  Good fit, cute and has a filter pocket. She doesn‚Äôt like the masks with the elastic as they bug her ears.  I ordered 2 more masks and they are different sizes in compared to the first one we got. Disappointed in the variation of sizes. The first masks I would give 5 stars, the two that just came are too small.",0
1,I am normally a Medium and ordered a large since it is cotton and wanted it to be loose fit.<br />It does not fit.  Seems more like it is a small medium<br />I really need to return it,0
1,Was not leather like it says in the description. Had to put charms back together due to metal pieces were not connected correctly,0
5,great show good fit,1
5,Love Love Love this bracelet.  Have several of his Rose creations.  So special,1
1,It was damaged,0
1,All they do is keep breaking apart,0
3,"Arrived quickly. Nice packaging. Product seems like good quality.  The bra is just much too small though. Definitely runs small, I would order a size or two bigger next time.",0
4,I've only had time to try this on. It fits well and the pockets are roomy,1
2,It‚Äôs cute but it was snug,0
3,Seems sturdy. Opening is a bit small. Difficult to get on and off my wrist (and I have small hands).,0
5,"perfect size for everyday essentials, or day trips.  nice quality leather.",1
5,"It is hard to buy jewelry on-line, but this is the best experience I've had.  The price, the service and product are all of the highest quality one could possibly expect.  The chain is a great quality, sturdy, sparkly, well made.  I have several silver pendants that I would like to wear at different lengths depending on my clothing, so I will eventually buy all sizes.",1
1,"No support!!  Very wimply and would not hold anything up!!  Sides caved in, too.  I was baggy and saggy.  Very disappointed!!",0
3,"Fun costume , but the head didn‚Äôt hold air very well, I had to hold its head up all night",0
2,It's a very thin product that bends easily.<br /><br />It doesn't turn my skin green though.,0
5,Nice.,1
3,"Ordered a small burgundy. The burgundy is not true to the normal ""deep red"" burgundy color and it's basically just a faded medium red color. It's also a lot more low cut than expected and would have to be worn with something underneath-which I hate doing. 3 star rating because it's not awful, I was just expecting something different and returned it.",0
5,"Stylish wooden glasses, with UV and polarized protection. Great price!",1
5,Very beautiful. I bought it for a gift for one of my daughters. My other daughter loved it so much I bought another one for her.,1
1,Seems pulled apart after opening package. Poorly made.,0
3,Worth the buy,0
5,"Looks nice, keeps watch very secure.",1
5,Came in a cute bag works as it should,1
5,Happy with purchase,1
2,I loved the graphics and design of the helmet. I bought the helmet brand new from amazon but ended up returning it due to a large scratch on the modular visor. It was brand new so I'm not sure how it got there. I was pretty bummed I had to send it back.,0
4,Color alittle off from picture,1
5,Its great! Im buying one in every color!,1
4,Does what it's supposed to. And price is ok.,1
3,"Runs somewhat small and made with two (2) different, stretchy fabrics.",0
1,These masks don‚Äôt look like the pic and don‚Äôt fit the description. They are of a very thin fabric and don‚Äôt have pocket for the filter. Also they don‚Äôt have nose clip. I didn‚Äôt return bcus I wasn‚Äôt going g to waste more money on return charges,0
1,Zipper broke after the second time I wore it......bad quality. Had to throw it away!  Don't waste your money!,0
1,"I bought the adult size. The item nearly strangled me, a smaller woman, as I struggled to pull it over my head. It has cuts in the material rather than ear loops, and fitting your ears into the cuts is tricky. When I tried to talk while wearing this thing, it was so tight that it sucked the material into my mouth and totally muffled my voice. I felt as I was being strangled trying to wear it. Also, the patterns do not look as nice and clear as the photos make them appear. I am very disappointed and am immediately returning for a refund. Simply awful!",0
1,awful,0
5,Excelente,1
1,Cheap looking,0
5,Just received the minister's stole today. Can't wait to use it for a wedding in March. Thanks again.,1

1,Didn't like is nothing lk the pictures,0
3,Stiff.,0
5, ,1
3,"Cute, but looks like costume jewelry for sure.  It's what you'd expect at the price.  I've worn it a few times and haven't had problems with clasp or chain yet. Arrived much quicker than the expected delivery date.",0
5,This is a great shirt. Soft and comfortable,1
3,I purchased this for a Holiday Party.  Decided not to wear it because the material is so thin.  It did fit me well so I decided to keep it and wear it during the summer.,0
1,Look very cheap,0
5,Loved this,1
2,"Looked so fake, I did not even used it.",0
4,"I liked this, did not love the material. It is a great summer robe though.",1
1,I was very disappointed. You cannot see the pleats in the photo. Do not like the pleats,0
1,Squinting is about as effective as the sunglasses. They really don‚Äôt provide any glare blockage.,0
2,"The material is not what expected, shiny and uncomfortable",0
5,Was a gift for my mom and she loved it. She hung it on her car rear view mirror,1
1,Flimsy and too small for a human neck above the age of 6 months.,0
2,Very thin and not warm.,0
5,Its very comfortable and stretches to fit right,1
4,"The product looks great and has a premium finish to it. However, I think the fit is a bit loose so better order .5 size smaller!",1
2,Cute. Wrinkly though and material is slightly weird.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô 134 lbs. small fit but could probably fit in a medium too.<br /><br />Update: after washing itt once and letting it air dry it shrunk like 3 inches! It‚Äôs now way above my ankles. Bummer.,0
1,It's a 2$ t shirt . At best.,0
4,Shirt isn't very soft. Washing helped a little. I'll just have to wear it out a bit ;) Other than that its great!,1
3,"The thickness of the material for these is a little bit thinner than expected.  Also, they are quite snug.  We bought the size suited to our little one's weight, but the size runs smaller than expected.  Also, there may be some shrinkage in washing.  Other than these small complaints, they're pretty decent...especially for the price.",0
1,Loved the look but after wearing for one day my ears became red. The interior ear pierced area was raw. If you have metal sensitivity like me skip these,0
5,"I got the blue plaid winter hat and I love it!!!  Stretchy, warm & cute!  The bottom is adjustable, roll it up or down the way you like. It‚Äôs gathered at the top, maybe add a pom?  Very comfortable and well made!  I must buy another in case I lose this one!",1
5,I love it. It fit right like what i expect. Its prettynet color. It is light weight to wear. Comfortable to used. I got the 6.5size they deliver it before the delivery date which makes me more hapier and satisfied.,1
5,Beautiful,1
5,"Excellent quality, silky and fashionable",1
1,"Cheaply made. Flowers coming off. Also the size is right, but they are short. My daughters feet had a hard time slipping in",0
5,Cute,1
3,The price should have been more of an indication but these feel real cheap when you are holding them... Oh well. Was a gift for my Mom and she seemed to really love them. Got each of her kids birthstones to go on a necklace.,0
3,Good for youngsters...,0
4,"Maybe I looked at the pictures wrong but I didn't realize there were flat until I got them. My 7b year old wanted them for his book bag and they're still on there, not broken yet so it's all good.",1
5,I love buying the faux wrap dresses from PattyBoutik to wear to work. They make such great dress clothes.,1
5,"The shirt looks like it did in the photos. The quality is good so far. I've washed it about 8 times and the graphic is still on and looks good. It fits well,  and it feels nice.",1
3,THE SKIRT IS CUTE.,0
3,Earrings are very nice......not crazy about necklace.,0
2,"I read the reviews before purchasing and was convinced to buy my normal size ( M 8‚Äì10). Because I‚Äôm curvier, I should‚Äôve sized up! I had a very hard time getting the suit on, but once I did, it fit at the waist, was slightly tight in the chest, and tighter than I‚Äôm comfortable with in the stomach/hips. Overall, it‚Äôs a nicely made and generally flattering suit, but I wish I had sized up.",0
3,"The color is absolutely different than on a picture. The pants are light baby blue ones, not dirty mint ones as shown. Fit is nice. Probably will be nice in spring/summer time. Dont like baby blue, but they are comfortable. Kept them.",0
3,"I put tickets to a show in the wallet for a Christmas present for my husband.  Unfortunately, looking at the picture, I did not realize it was so flat and did not have a snap or some kind of closure.  I will probably need to get a roomier one for him.",0
5,Definitely. Would buy again.,1
5,This is a top quality product that I am confident will work perfect.  In my professional role I am not able to have any tattoos exposed.  I want to finish a sleeve and I have found the perfect way to do it and still maintain my work expectations.  I have looked at MANY products & none were as amazing as this one.,1
5,Super cute ...and arrived in a cute box which was a nice touch! Thinking about getting a set in another color,1
3,Very constrictive on the wrist,0
4,Comfortable,1
1,Was way to big fit like a moo moo,0
5,These are fantastic! Bought them for all my girlfriends for Christmas. Everyone keeps telling me about all the complements they are getting on them. Everyone loves them!,1
2,The straps keep popping off. The back band is not 36 and would not fit if it wasn‚Äôt for the included extender.,0
3,"Reverse stitchng at the waist, and very see through.",0
5,The most solid cufflinks I have ever purchased. I'm so happy with it.,1
5,Great lightweight robe. I got it to stop the static shocks I was getting in my synthetic robe and it worked! I practically live in it at home.,1
4,Just as described,1
2,"Its literally 2 little ""pads"" (if I can even call them that) with a stick side....not impressed. Should be thicker and higher quality for the price",0
5,As advertised.,1
1,The stone was loose in the bag and not in the setting. Very disappointed,0
5,Looks great and is easy to clean,1
5,"The bag is great, looks stylish, seems durable. Didn't realize this from pics but also has convenient pockets on each end as well as internal pocket.",1
3,Fits large. However it is very toxic smelling. It was washed 7 seven times. Finally with baking soda helped to get it to where you could have it on for five minutes. We also had to make eye holes and more breathing and hearing holes.,0
2,This dress is not my favorite of the summer dresses by Elise Bloom. I don't like the top piece and I don't like the bottom and I don't like that it doesn't fit according to their size chart.,0
5,"I love this eyes glasses, they are comfortable and looks really cool and stylish. Highly recommend this product",1
1,Shirt came in way too small,0
3,I think I would love them if they fit - too tight. I wear an 8.5 and I should have gotten a 9 or 9.5 for slip on comfort.,0
3,"This skirt is well made and the pattern is very cute. However,  I found that there is just too much fabric making the skirt extremely  full.",0
5,They seem to be of decent quality and exactly as described.  Happy with the purchase.,1
5,"This dress looked great, I got it for the holidays. The material it‚Äôs very thick, perfect for cold weather. I am 5‚Äô3 weight 130 lbs and medium fit me perfectly. It‚Äôs very short though, but looks great, classy & it‚Äôs comfortable.",1
3,This has no padding? Wtf,0
3,"A lightweight shoe for my almost 5 year old. One shoe is not as comfortable to her foot, but this wasn't noticed until after wearing a few times. Also, these shoes scuff easily and show wear and tear quickly. It will do, but I think there are better options from other brands or styles in this price range.",0
5,"When people give reviews they should really really shut the f'up if they don't understand how to give a review. Take a look at the previous reviews about this product please. I am so glad that I don't make my final decision about buying something based on reviews. I get it, it's the way of competition. I come from old school, and its about having good sportsmanship. I never was the type to follow others or just because social media say I should try this. I'm not going to try it. These buckles are worth the price and nicely made. I'm going to let you do the math on how much each one of these buckles cost. You will then find out why I hate to listen to others when they give negative reviews on products like this.",1
5,Nice,1
5,Purchased these for my daughter to wear on her wedding day. Absolutely perfect and lovely with her dress. She has smallish ears and they fit perfectly. Great value for the price!,1
5,"Of the many styles of survival paracord bracelets I've bought, this is probably the best, but it still has issues.  On the positive side, the adjustable strap make it the first one that actually fits my wrist.  And the quality of the fit and tolerances is excellent.  The light is extremely faint, but if you drop your keys in total darkness, you'll be glad to have it.  I love the SOS function, even though I doubt you'd see it from very far away.  The compass will not give you an accurate reading unless you first remove the metal knife & tool.  The screwdriver & wrench functions actually work, but only on very small nuts & screws.  The whistle is loud for its size.  The pin is cool but I doubt I'll ever use it.  My only major disappointment is that after 5 minutes of trying, I couldn't get the magnesium rod to spark.  But I still give it 5 stars just for the ingenuity and overall quality.",1
4,Im totally in love with this top cant wait to wear it out just a mi or issue the part between my arm nd forest is a bit tight byt the cotton materiAl is a material that relaxes after awhile si im bot too worried it was totally worth it,1
3,"I believe I got what I paid for. The bracelet is large, better for a guy. The beads and charms are fine, but the knot elastic thread has ends long enough to stick out from the bracelet. Will restring to make it smaller.",0
2,Runs big,0
5,"Great quality,  can fit quite a bit, stood up to shower water without any problems.",1
4,Pretty earrings.  The three color choices are great.,1
5,Fit perfect.  Better than expected.  Love it!<br />Doris Nelson,1
5,My daughter loves these!,1
2,looks and feels cumbersome,0
5,Very comfortable! The colors are beautiful.,1
2,"I didn‚Äôt mind the thinness, but I ordered a 18-24 month. My daughter is one usually wear 12 months, sometimes 18. The dress was very small and entirely too short to be a dress.",0
5,I bought it for my daughter she loves it. Her name is rare just like her and I wanted her to feel special. Thank you for the design it's perfect .,1
1,Cannot use for my purposes... the screw  near the bottom hinge is so sharp on ALL OF THEM.  Never expect that. Shame.,0
5,Son loves,1
1,"While I like the softness of the material it is too thin and see through, a lot smaller than the black on I got on the same size but if I would have gone a size larger the arm holes would have been too big, as much as I want to keep it I could only wear it with a jean jacket and that beats the purpose of the material.",0
5,"The doggies are super cute!  The socks are a nice quality and perfect for a little touch of personality in my work outfits.  I have smaller feet (size 6.5) and these are the perfect fit, if you have larger feet they might be a bit snug.",1
5,They went on quick and easy. After I put the springs on the new hubcaps I pulled the 2 factory ones that had not fallen off with my fingers. I have lost 6 hubcaps since we bought the car. The 2  I remove had broken parts and were about to fall off. I could not pull the new ones off with my hands after I installed them. A lot better than the crap Toyota put on we it came from the factory. Note: The indent in the spring wire you put on the hubcaps goes down facing the cut out for the valve stem. If you put it on so it is facing you or gets in the way of the stem and can't be installed. The wire spring went on the inner clips to fit our wheels. On the outer clips it was too big aroiund to go on the rim. There was no paper work showing which way the indent should go in the package. They were all incased in form covers in the box to protect them during shipment. I bought others on the web and they fell off like the originals. These will stay on. We have a 2006 Camry XLT.,1
2,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 115lbs and size small was too big,0
1,Worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. Clasp broke as I was removing the 1st one from the wrapper. As I stretched the others to check the clasp they all came undone from the belt. I hate returns but here I go.,0
1,Hoops are too small for your nose,0
2,Not what I expected,0
5,They are great,1
3,Waist of money does last more then an hr ... doesn't the fan dont help plus they send u the wrong face plate,0
5,Todo,1
5,Love it!,1
2,no support,0
5,"These are the perfect goggles!  They can fit an adult down to a child, easy to adjust and the clasp in back makes it easy to put on, no hair pulling.  Durable and they look good too!",1
3,"I was hoping these pants had a little drape to the fabric that would make them look more like a skirt. The fabric is thick and rather stiff. The cut is weird, almost like the pockets were put on backward. Also, the fabric care tag had been cut off when I received them. I'm keeping them because they're comfortable but not what I expected.",0
5,Quality,1
2,Very uncomfortable. I had to run a lighter across it to burn off the strings and glue that was scratching me.,0
1,Just terrible.,0
1,"The bra was too small. My body poked out of it in very unflattering ways. Yes, I'm over-weight, but the XL should've fit me. I've sent both bras back.",0
1,"I've been wearing them everyday, sixteen bucks! so far so good.<br />After a few months both soles cracked, wow, I hate to throw money away.",0
5,True to the color. Great material and very nice. It was jus bigger than expected but I highly recommend it for someone who move around with a lot of stuff.,1
5,I‚Äôve tried 3 other brands of compression socks and these are by far the easiest to put on and take off. Pretty comfortable to wear for about 12 hours which is what I needed. Very happy with this purchase so I bought a second pair!,1
1,Wore it one time and the inner thigh seam came apart at an event. Had to throw it away.,0
3,"Ordered cause it was meant to come with matching bands and face covers.<br /><br />I received the bands, which look nice but the bright purple face cover was a very light, navy blueish pink color.<br /><br />Everything else seemed ok but I ordered for the purple.",0
5,Nice. A lil snug,1
5,Very nice looking,1
5,Really ? What did I use it for lol Sleeping !!!!!!,1
2,Bad quality belt not what i expected the buckle is the only thing im saving to put in a real leather belt,0
3,Missing the first three pairs,0
4,"This Duffel has the same weak spot as many other affordable price bags.<br />To keep the handles together for grab and go, they use a cheap hook & loop wrap that wears off before the bag even gets broken in.",1
4,"Great product for the price. It's close to being true-to-size but I would recommend buying one size larger than you need. Also, the drawstring is just for show so the shorts cannot be tightened.",1
5,Very cute quick delivery,1
2,"I ordered two sets of these to use for my three lobe piercings on each ear. I felt pretty confident in my purchase after ordering, but for each earring one of the backs (there is one on each end) fell off. They were all gone within 2 weeks. The earrings are very pretty, good quality CZ but they would just not stay in",0
2,I should‚Äôve read the description before purchasing.. I absolutely detest polyester! PERIODT.. it‚Äôs poor quality,0
3,Ordered a 2xl and is about the size of a large,0
4,Very nice fabric. Definitely shorter than I would like. Would still buy another.,1
3,shorter than anticipated. My height is 5'7'',0
1,This is not worth the purchase price. Material is cheap. It is barely big enough....doesn't adjust any larger.,0
5,"Love the feel & size, this purse meets and exceeds my needs!",1
5,"Very easy to change original band for this one. Also, the resizing tool made it very easy to adjust the size for your wrist.",1
5,I used toppers to top parfait dessert.  The cupcake wrappers fit well.,1
1,Couldn't get some of these opened.  The ones I was able to open I couldn't get closed once in my ear.  Will not order again.,0
4,"Nice bag, bigger than I expected, pretty hot-pink color (which I love), the handles are very unique.  I received it very quickly & was packaged very nicely. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bag is so stiff to open but otherwise it's lovely ‚ù§üëú",1
5,Volver√© a comprar,1
3,Was not the shoe in the picture,0
5,"Love this sweater, I bring it every where. It‚Äôs soft and comfy",1
1,"I got it for myself and eventually gave it away due to it being slightly too big and just overall hot.  It's weird how it provides warmth on my back area.  My friend who received it, hated the way it warmed certain areas hated it too.",0
1,Bought as a birthday gift to my daughter and she loved it‚Ä¶.the only thing is that the moonstone fell off as soon as she put the ring on. The stone snapped back in but kept falling out‚Ä¶.you get what you pay for I guess. I ended up returning the ring.,0
5,PERFECT,1
1,The camel toe is strong in these shorts. Don't buy loolol,0
1,Not to size and looks so much better in the photo than in person.,0
2,"I was so excited about these earrings, but when I got them, I realized that they aren't actually stitched scraps of leather. The pattern was printed on. They looked cheap, so I returned them.",0
5,"100 percent happy , good material nicely made",1
5,Very pretty. Easy to add and remove charms.,1
5,"Well made, good buy.",1
3,"The quality is not very good. Stitches and threads come out. Does not fit right, not slimming. Overall I am not very happy, but will keep it as a spare.",0
1,"i ordered  a much larger size and it was still to small- the crotch fit really weird on me and I could not figure out how to wear it in a flattering way. i bunched up in the crotch but tried to create a wedgie in the back.<br /><br />Also, I expected denim, or material closer to denim and it was just a polyester print- very cheap material.",0
5,"I love my bracelet! It's very comfortable to wear, light weight. I have been wearing it for a couple of months now and it is holding up great. Not showing any signs of wear.",1
5,"Fun, cute, heavy",1
3,Smaller than normal sizing. Size up. I returned.,0
1,The three that was worn this week cam apart!<br />VERY POOR QUALITY!<br />And I bout two sets of five... very dissatisfied,0
3,Love the top of this swimsuit. It is a little too big where my boobs are at. I will probably end up returning this for a Large. Overall I love the cross cross straps in the back and the flowy tank around the bottom.,0
3,"I bought these lenses hoping they would go well with my new Oakleys. I got the silver chrome lense and they looked awesome on my jawbreaker frame. The thing is, when you put them on, there is a tint of green and purple that is given off when looking at certain colors while I'm riding on the street. It gives off a 3D effect that makes the road look rather weird. They made me naucious at times. They need to improve the quality of the lense so it doesn't give off weird coloring effects when wearing them.",0
5,These run big:  I wear a large but these were to big.  But I do like them so I‚Äôm exchanging for a medium.,1
3,It‚Äôs OK at best. VERY THINN.  Not a WOW item but I can wear it everyday as opposed to having my wrist empty. Also the adjustable strings are way too and I can see myself being annoyed when wearing them for a while.,0
4,THEY ARE GREAT,1
1,Hippie belt!  If you are a huppie vegan this will be awesome for you!,0
3,The shirt isn't red all the way through the inside is white and it seems like they just sprayed the outside with color. Fits properly. Very light weight.,0
5,I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother-in-law.  This little gem far exceeded my expectations.  It's lovely and well made.  The image doesn't do it justice.,1
5,"Worth the money and unique. If you have a small neck, it might be a little large.",1
1,This is not the same quality as the original band for Nano Vista glasses.  The clasp of the band broke after a single use.,0
2,There was no engraving I love you on this ring like it was shown.,0
5,Liked them... soft and light and works,1
2,I bought these for my husband and he does ac/heating and is on the rooftops 150 degrees and these boots don‚Äôt have any traction they slip in water please know if you are working in these kinda places please don‚Äôt spend your money on these boots my husband does like to where them when we go to dinner but not to work very dangerous,0
3,"So far, so good. No problems as of yet. The last time I purchase one it kept turning over to the other side, just showing the the side without the Red hologram.",0
5,"THESE ARE PAUL MALONE TIES, IN SILK WITH THE MATCHING HANKY AND CUFFLINKS. SUPERB QUALITY , IN COLOR AND IN MATERIAL. A VERY GOOD STAPLE IN A MAN'S WARDROBE. IF YOU NEED TO LOOK GREAT AND GET COMPLIMENTS FROM YOUR PEERS AND ADMIRERS. THEN THE PAUL MALONE TIE AND HANKY SETS ARE FOR YOU !",1
5,Love the dress it's beautifully so comfortable so comfortable can wear  it anywhere.dress it up or casual. I love everything about it!,1
3,"I was hoping for better fabric, which is quite cheap. The dress does look nice and true to the pictured color.",0
2,It broke two days I received it!,0
1,Nothing like the picture. It‚Äôs thin fabric not like a sweater. It isn‚Äôt long like it is on the model either.,0
5,"Fun, comfortable, and well received as gift.",1
5,The Bklyn beanie is a perfect hat for the winter. It‚Äôs comfortable and fits well. It‚Äôs stylish and able to be worn while shoveling snow or a night on the town. The material is very soft and you can see what a quality product it is as soon as you slip it on.,1
3,The dress is cute and I purchased a small. However it is a little too loose on me and kinda a baggy fit. Otherwise it seems to be of good quality and the color as expected. It might look good on tall build - it maybe because the baggy fit was not faltering on me. I am short and petite build.,0
1,"The fabric is sheer. You can literally read a newspaper through this material doubled. Sending them back for a refund. Not suitable to wear in public unless it's with a bathing suit. I've had this pattern pant before that was like true rayon, this is is more like sheer muslin. Very disappointed.",0
3,The outfit is adorable. But that quality is truly washed away after the first washing.<br /><br />The material gathered ‚Äúballs‚Äù all over the outside and is not worthy to wear in public.<br /><br />This outfit was good for one wearing.,0
4,The shirt is super cute but the material wasn‚Äôt soft enough for me.,1
4,Cute cute cute!  The only thing that gave me pause is I had to turn the earwires around.  Otherwise the faces were turned to my back.  Weird.,1
1,"So disappointed. The shirt came in a plastic ziplock pouch and when I opened it, the pungent chemical smell almost knocked me out. The picture depicts it as a casual, loose t-shirt and what I received is a cheaply made, shiny (like work out material) shirt that looks nothing like the picture. So disappointed.",0
3,"Sized wrong , medium-sized was like an extra large had to return",0
1,Posts we're too skinny. The backs wouldn't stay on. Tried different backings and same outcome.,0
5,"Super cute! I thought it was a clip-on, it's not, it has an adjustable strap that goes around the neck.",1
4,"It really perfect with one acception, which I knew before I purchased it. I wish it were a real coin. LOL",1
1,Received empty package!,0
5,Nice fir,1
5,I bought this 2 sizes larger then normal and its fits perfect alittle short but i love it,1
3,"They are a little small, very pixalated blurry not what it shows in the picture. But still cute and comfy.",0
4,Muy buena calidad y grosor de la tela,1
5,Doesn‚Äôt have the stretch like most newer jeans do. Good quality jeans.  The embroidery is gorgeous.  Rise is nice so my belts will fit. Don‚Äôt get too small thinking they will stretch because they won‚Äôt.  Tory run true to size.,1
5,"Bought this for my son, he is a big fan. He loved it as soon as he saw it! It was priced just right, it‚Äôs thickness and quality was just right.",1
5,I had to look a long time to find an 8 hook key case.  This one has very good quality leather construction.,1
2,These are so cute but holy camel toe. I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt wear these.,0
3,The zipper broke on 2 of the bags as I was packing. Very cheap quality. The other 2 bags were okay and I was able to keep my belongings somewhat organized during my trip to 3 cities in 6 days. Nice color.,0
1,too small,0
3,I have to keep sewing it because they are WAY to big.,0
5,Absolutely adorable! A little big but my daughter will grow into it.,1
5,For that price I was expecting a low quality cap but it is really very nice!,1
3,Very cute but wasn‚Äôt going to fit my 9year old,0
5,Solid with real metal.easy to use.,1
1,Ordered a size 25 for im a size 23ish and omg size 25 too small this pants looks like a size 19. Nice jeans but too small for me. Another waste of money and disappointment üòí,0
5,I love this shirt. It's comfortable and a nicer quality than I expected.,1
5,"Adore moonstones, and this is very nice.  A little larger than I thought, but I still love it!",1
3,Smaller than described.,0
1,"VERY disappointed! The first time I ordered these I received a pair of eevee leggings that were very soft and fit perfectly! I ordered again using the same link and received a pair of completely different branded leggings  (C Marc Classic)- which did NOT fit and were a much different fabric! I returned those and tried again (I loved the eevee and really had hopes of getting MANY more!) But, again I received the C Marc Classic - which I am AGAIN returning. It's unfortunate because I intended to buy a large quantity of the advertised product. Don't waste your money - I guarantee the C Marc Classic brand is garbage!",0
5,OMG I love these glasses they looked better than pictured. They make everything look so clear and they look great on. Buy them you will love them.,1
1,I could have made this work if they only would have included the belt I am missing the belt to this item looks ridiculous,0
3,Go up one size,0
3,not for florida. its to hot,0
2,Way to big,0
3,"The price is right, but the links are already falling off even while being careful with it.",0
1,Honestly looks like costume jewelry up close.,0
3,This was supposed to come with a headband but it did not. ‚òπ,0
5,My husband always wears M but these are kinds too big they look like normal on the guy but kinda not so slim at the bottom.. pretty cool material and came in fast!,1
5,"I am very happy with the dress, it fit really good except the sleeves  were little long and snug other than this loved the color and Flour design.",1
1,Clasp for stockings literally flew when it popped off. Shoulder strap broke as soon as I put it on.,0
3,"The only problem that I have with this necklace is that it I hooks very often, other than that it is beautiful",0
3,"The watch itself is very nice and I get many compliments on it, however the band is horrible. For this watch to be so nice it is as if someone intentionally tried to bring this watch down a peg by putting this cheap rinky dink pu leather band on it. No worries I am going to put an aftermarket band on it.",0
4,"I ordered a size smaller but it's still a little bit  big. I still wear it though and I love it, I might order another pair . smaller this time ..:)",1
5,This is going to make a nice Christmas present.,1
5,Bling bling should be my middle name!,1
3,"Really cute, but not at all correct in sizing. Runs about 2 sizes too small.",0
3,Too small.... Great look,0
2,"I liked it, and since I knew from the reviews it was somewhat small, I ordered a size larger than normal and it fit great. However it had a horrible smell that I could not get rid of. I tried washing it multiple times, washing it with oxi-clean and sunning, but still the formaldehyde smell was too much to take.",0
2,"This septum ring is beautiful, except after two days of wearing it two of the bigger gems fell out. So sad! Because other than that it was perfect! Adorably dainty, with just the perfect amount of pizzazz! üòøüòøüòø",0
5,Fits great.,1
5,I bought them for a 4 year old and 2 year old to use in the bathtub but they are using them in the swimming pool and they are working great and seal well even when jumping off of the diving board.,1
3,"This is not for us curvy girls! I kept it in hopes I can wear in the future, but definitely size up if you are blessed with hips.",0
5,Love this ring.,1
5,"I‚Äôm usually a small and I ordered a medium based off reviews. It looks nice, good quality but defiantly shrinks substantially after wash and dry!",1
1,Im a fan of Maggie Tang tops but this was an awkward fit. Had to return.,0
1,These are available on other sites for 2.00 and also the quality is of low grade. Not a good product ..the picture appears much nicer..must be the lighting..,0
5,The perfect solution to stud earrings falling out. Very affordable and effective.,1
5,I bought this for myself and it was a great buy. Looks and feels great!,1
1,too large,0
2,"Pretty pattern with vertical accents.  Cut is small, VERY HIGH WAISTED, and short.  Disappointed üòû",0
1,I ordered the purple and pink silicone key ring and only received the purple one. This is not okay. I paid for 2 and only received one.,0
1,"Its just a hole in the middle of the shirt, no tie no nothing just a hole",0
4,"I am 5'9 around 185, ordered a large. Fits good, could not wear it as a dress though. Definetly need leggings under it. Very roomy, swing fit, almost to big in hip area. Very comfy! Will wear and accessorize with a scarf!",1
5,My dad tried these socks on and compared it to other running and compression socks he had. These appear to be higher and cover the knee slightly on his 5'7 frame. They have a nice soft feel and the top cuff is smooth and not too tight on top.,1
2,Super small! Ordered a size 15 and it barley fit my mom whose a size 7! It does have a good materiel and looks nice it's just too small,0
4,Nice and soft washed a few times and no little cotton bumps or peeling.  Very comfy,1
3,Gift,0
1,Didn‚Äôt work well at all.,0
5,Nice but cheap shirt. It looks like it wasn‚Äôt finished.,1
1,Ill fitted small in arms huge in torso,0
1,It doesn't not look like the picture yes the leggings are the same pattern but the shirt while yeah it's the same print the style of the shirt is a normal shirt not oversized at all and it doesn't hang off the shoulder like it shows.,0
1,"I think the swimsuit itself is cute and would have really enjoyed it had it not arrived with a defect. On the top strap of the bottom part of the swimsuit, I noticed a bulge. If it wasn't that bad, I would've just worn the swimsuit anyway, but it was really noticeable--trust me, the pictures don't do it justice.<br /><br />The seller hasn't been responsive, so this morning I decided that if I was truly stuck with this thing, I'd try to make it work, so I cut a small slit in the inner part of the strap to pull the &#34;stuffing&#34; out. The photo is what came out. Whoever sewed the swimsuit not only stuffed a bunch of extra fabric into the strap but actually sewed the extra fabric INTO THE SEAM, so it's impossible for me to pull it out unless I open up the ENTIRE seam and cut it out.<br /><br />As I said, the swimsuit itself is cute, so I'm really disappointed in the poor quality. I'll be continuing to try to return it.",0
3,It‚Äôs not the same design that I ordered but it does the job,0
5,The polishing cloth did a fine job of cleaning and polishing my silver jewelry. Good purchase.,1
2,The star fish broke very soon after I bought the product and I could not get it to go back on.,0
5,"Got it for a gift for my Dad, and has not taken it off since Christmas!",1
1,"The badge is more of a shiny shade of purple than black and even less tolerable is the ""gray"" design that's actually pink.<br /><br />Pink!",0
5,"At first, these felt a bit snug on my size 7, medium-width feet,  but as I broke them in they softened, and now they are like walking around with cozy clouds on my feet.  The soles are sturdy enough to walk outside, but soft enough for hanging around the house comfortably. I got these in the plum/purple color. Love them!",1
3,"Face front is a nice width. Ear loops are inset, so very close together. Great for a toddler or very small child, but I had to boil the earpieces to bend them to a straighter line for my child.",0
5,Really nice! The band was very easy to install. The blue color is just as pictured and the band isn't flimsy feeling. Great product at a great price.,1
1,Too small and uncomfortable,0
1,"When I first got it I loved it. But in one week of wearing it I realized that the back of one of the earrings is missing. I don't know when did it come off or where. Looking for it also turned out a hassle since the plastic is clear and impossible to spot. So there you have it, I spent 25 dollars for nothing :(",0
1,"Sizes are not accurate and my seven month old son still ended up with rashes on his face with this on. My son has been diagnosed with eczema since he was nine weeks old and this did not help. If you are looking for something that irritates the skin less, this is not the right product. I would only recommend this product if your child is scratching their face or ears causing bleeding/scratches.",0
5,My friend was impressed. She wore it out to dinner that same evening.,1
1,Very cheaply made and was too small and way too long,0
5,"Sturdy fabric, comfortable and true to size.",1
1,It was super small! I have to send it back. That is really frustrated!,0
1,"Received mine with glue smudges on frame and specs all over, I cannot tell if it‚Äôs by design or scratches; more like scratches to me. The arms are just horrible.",0
1,"Very disappointed!! Gawdy, inexpensive looking, large chunky, photo is deceiving!",0
1,"Was excited to receive this dress, only to find that it was torn. :-(",0
5,Very comfy,1
5,Great product,1
4,Hard to get it open and both are extremely short as in would fit a child,1
5,Love these but one did not turn out and didn't get refund,1
2,"The fit was slightly different than i expected. I wanted it to be more flowy, but it was just a thick tank... not much else to say about it",0
3,I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs comfortable and I can see it looks good but why does a shirt that looks old and worn have to cost so much?,0
4,Looks good but hard to see in day or night time,1
5,I love these ear muffs. They keep the wind  and cold away from my ears. Great fit for an adult and the different colors to wear with your outfit.,1
4,Just what my daughter was looking for.,1
1,The clip rusts.,0
1,These are not Microfiber at all I would never trust putting any type of sunglasses in these pouches. The description is incorrect. This fabric will scratch your sunglasses. Returning to Amazon. Also the bags are on the small size for sunglasses.,0
5,Nice tank. Just too large.,1
2,way to small,0
2,"I ordered a pretty large size, but -although they fit - they were 1 size too small, and feel very tight.",0
1,Broke first week,0
5,This product got great reviews and I now know why. The key fobs worked perfectly every time. I bought the red handled tool sold by this same company and it has plastic covers on the pliers so you don‚Äôt mess up the fob as you close it right. Not cheap material.,1
3,It has a bit of an odd shape and does the material is a bit cheap. Wish I could return it.,0
5,"I had to look a couple times to make sure this is black, it seems almost navy blue in certain light, but it is black. The sizing is accurate and easily tightened by the drawstring at the waist.  i love this aspect of it so I can make it a little more form fitting and less shapeless.  The details on this coat are very beautiful and well done. There are also lots and lots of pockets, yay!<br /><br />The first time I wore this, my daughter told me I looked like a model. It is super trendy and stylish. It is perfect for spring weather because  its not too heavy and warm but it keeps you warm when the wind blows and during these chilly pennsylvania days. It has been my go to for when i have to run to the store (back when I still left my house) when I would usually just throw on a hoodie. It makes me look like my outfit is put together even when its not!<br /><br />I think this is a great quality piece, I am unsure of the pricing on this coat but would expect to pay around $50 for this if purchased in a department store.",1
4,Dress is very pretty. Excellent customer service .,1
1,The bandanas are just fine but I only received 4. There should‚Äôve been two 4-packs  in my package but there was only one 4-pack. I left feedback for the seller but never got a response.,0
1,Encoje,0
5,Fit good but was long. But I love it. Will be ordering again but need to know what size to get so that the skirt want be too long. First time ordering clothing on Amazon. I am only 5'4 but the skirt was long enough for someone who is about 5'6.,1
5,These are super cute with very bright colors and details.,1
5,Super cute. Worked well on adult and toddler crocs,1
5,They are adorable and give time wardrobe a pop. They are sturdy,1
5,Our son loved it for his Halloween costume.,1
5,Love it just what I wanted,1
5,These are fantastic - my legs are not even sore after a 12 hour shift. They held up in the wash and I wear them a lot!,1
2,The belt is WAY too small.  It's more like a &#34;thigh&#34; belt!  Made for someone with a 16&#34; waist!,0
2,"The ring is beautiful, heavy and comfortable. Unfortunately, it came apart after three days of wearing. I would love to purchase another, and likely will at some point but I hope that the next does not break down so quickly.",0
2,"The fabric is terrible and it does not hold up.  When it gets wet from sweat, hat just flops.",0
1,The boot were too big and it took entirely too long to receive the package<br />Still trying to get my refund,0
5,Great,1
4,"I adore this design and as always love this brand of compression socks they are excellent for nurses, the only downside to these is the designs on them are an overlay of threading so they're adorable but towards the end of the shift when your feet are really swollen they cut into your skin. So when I took them off I had little heart pitting going on down my left calf where my leg swells the most. If you're not prone to swelling and just need the compression thought these are excellent!",1
3,This belt does not look as good as the picture.,0
5,really cute!  Great service,1
5,This glasses is really amazing! It looks pretty cool wearing it and the quality is great! Can't wait to drive my car wearing it.,1
5,"Got these for my Daughter for her winter fest dance. And boy did she love them, she really like the way they sparkled.<br />Fast shipping",1
1,Beware do not buy this sweater. What they send is a cheap knockoff of the sweater pictured. Would not even give it a one star but it wouldn't allow review to be posted otherwise.,0
3,"I loved this thing for 1 week and then tonight I just noticed the spinner had broken off and I was just wearing the chain so I‚Äôm pretty sad about that, I‚Äôll search my house and car but if it",0
5,"This is a lovely cut crystal heart. The blue is such a unique tone and I get so many compliments every single time I wear it. Don't get overly excited about the chain, it is ok but can used to be replaced with a much nicer silver chain. That would make this necklace even more beautiful. If you are into hearts, the color blue and crystal then you must add this to your collection. The heart itself is a nice size, not heavy at all.",1
1,It‚Äôs a cute design for sure but I need something more quality as far as BOT see through. As well as it came with a rip so I am defiantly disappointed.,0
5,Nice,1
1,"I loved the fact I was able to find this wallet again. However, it's either VERY cheaply made OR i got a bad pick out of the bunch because i just recieved mine today and it's falling apart by the buckle. Super disappointed!",0
5,I use this hat for every day wear but not for work.,1
1,Bulky underneath clothing,0
4,"This was the second pair of Bionic shoes that I bought for my wife. She loved the first pair, so I bought a different pair of the same size.<br />However, I probably should have gone with a half size smaller since these are slip it's.<br />Even so, she's happy with this pair. Claims that they're very comfortable.",1
5,Very beautiful piece and complement in my outfit that I wore with it.,1
5,Love these socks. So adorable!!!,1
5,Linen always looks classic and timeless! Love this dress!,1
5,"Great grip, a teensy bit small, but still comfy.",1
1,Narrow shoulders,0
5,Very soft and comfortable to wear!,1
5,"I am a 2x and ordered a 4x to make sure it fit, and it fits me the way I like it. I don't care for my clothes to fit tight.",1
3,"I am 5'6&#34; 170lbs, 38B. The top was too small  for me in the bust. Seemed to be made well for the price. This tank would be good for a skinny chick. It's also short. It ends at waist line.",0
1,Delivered with a dead battery smh,0
1,The strap on these shoes broke (right at the stitching) after only 2-3 wears.  Very disappointing since the return time had past and we really would have loved to have had these replaced.,0
5,"Love this necklace! Perfect long length, nice solid construction, and super cute!",1
1,"Hands freeze every so often, works about 30% of the time.",0
5,My mom she loved it!!!,1
3,I have size 12 feet. I should have payed more attention to the size. I thought with them expanding it would be ok but I can zip them up.,0
5,"This are my favorite boots! The quality is really good, They Run half to 1 size bigger, be aware of getting them on a smaller size than your actual size",1
1,Absolute garbage the bill was twisted it doesn't fit right tho it's large enough and the stick was cockeyed,0
5,Good basic gardening gloves. We will see about the durability by late fall or even next spring.,1
5,Perfect for 9 yr old who loves sequins.  She can wear according to outfit.  Great price.,1
5,It was a perfect gift for a Disney Sleeping Beauty fan.,1
5,Wow great quality,1
5,Granddaughter picked out these Mickey shorts herself! Plus a Mickey shirt to match!! Precious...,1
5,Item came so quickly!  Item is really lovely and I especially love it because my family is from Scotland and I had the privilege of visiting the UK and love the memories.  Thank you for the necklace / pendant charm and for the lovely extra gift tucked in the package.  I look forward to shopping with you on Amazon again.,1
1,"Not as picture shown, a picture shown leather but the product i got is a suede. If you want to do a business , you have to be honest.",0
5,S√∫per cute and comfortable,1
5,"Somewhat small - I usually wear a Med/Large - so Large is best for me. (I'm 5'9"", 140lbs)",1
2,"The skirt looks nothing like the picture, it fits really loosely and fabric is awful. I can't send it back because I'm in Jamaica and will have to pay to ship it so I guess I will just have to throw it away...I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase.",0
5,Lightweight and soft.  My daughter loves them.,1
5,"The headband is fun to wear as it makes observers smile.  My head is a size large, and this headband fits with ease.",1
5,Great slides for price,1
3,"I bought a pair of these in brown on sale for around $140  and ended up returning them. They have several obvious manufacturing issues. The welt was cut a it short on the right boot, the lining is paper thing and will tear easily, the came with  with a cheep foam insert on top of a cardboard insole. These are not made like a $300  pair of American made boots.  These are of lower quality than a pair of $150 Chippewa boots that I own. If you were going to spend $300 on a pair of boots you would be much better off with a pair of Redwings or Wolverine 1000 miles. If you watch out for sales you can find them for around that price fairly often. For $200 you could get a nice pair of Thorogoods.",0
2,"The XXL is closer to U.S. Large. That is the only reason I scored this one star. It's a beautiful skirt, incredibly soft cotton-like feel rather than polyester as the tag says and lightweight. I wish I could wear it, I normally wear an XL and purchased one size up due to other reviews, but it's still too small.",0
3,"SOFT ON THE OUTSIDE AND LOOKED PRETTY ON OUTSIDE, BUT KINDA SCRATCHY ON THE INSIDE, NOT HIGH QUALITY,  BUT IT WAS A PRETTY ROBE, THE WHITE INSIDE ALSO MADE IT LOOK CHEAP.",0
4,Love the look on my wife.  She loves it too.  Great belt.  She wears it with a fantastic go go dress and looks lovely.,1
3,"The detail I  liked most on the green scrub was  the turned  up buttoned sleeve , however, the scrub was far cuter on the model in the picture then me. On me , it looked boxy and the fabric was like somewhat rough muslin. Finding it unflattering on me , I returned it.",0
1,These came with existing holes in one pair and the other two tore like tissue paper. Super disappointed.,0
5,I like the ease of use.,1
1,Poor quality. The sizes listed are not correct.  In a T-shirt I wear XL for comfort.  Ordered the  XXXL and still too small. Part of the problem is it is very thin and flimsy material.  We writing is ‚Äú glued on‚Äù. After three weeks still trying to return and having issues with the supplier. DO NOT ORDER. Poor quality and returns most difficult. I soo regret buying this product.,0
3,"Very thin string, beads are smaller then shown.",0
1,"First of all, battery died prematurely twice.  Both times it was replaced by a reputable jewler.  The third time the jewler told me the watch is dead because of water leakage into the housing.  Indeed, there was rust inside the watch.  Second of all, to replace the battery, you have to remove the pins from both straps - an incredible feat in itself, since the pins are very difficult to remove.  Third, the wrist band is very stiff and uncomfortable.  Fourth, the glass face is very reflective and it makes reading the display very difficult.  Fifth, when you remove the watch and place it on any surface, chances are that you will depress the light switch on the side of the watch, and then if you don't notice it, you will drain the battery very fast.  Final tally: don't buy this thing, spend your money on something better.",0
5,Great quality,1
5,These earrings are simply beautiful!! They have such a rich look. To see them it looks like I spent a fortune on them!! Class without breaking the bank!! The quality of the I blue earrings is amazing!! They are so gorgeous the pictures don't give them justice. I love how they have so many colors in them that you can wear them with just about any outfit dressy or casual! They are really a nice item. They came in a pretty little velvet baggy. They are not real heavy but they do have some weight to them. My ears are very sensitive and these didn't irritate my ears like most earrings do. I highly recommend them.<br />I recieved these earrings at a discounted price in exchange for an honest opinion.,1
4,"This is a nice product. Depending on your height and build, the necklace might long on your neck but nevertheless the lace is good. I'd recommend this for your Drake cosplay.",1
5,"Normally knitted fabrics give me an itch after a while of wearing but these leggings are the complete opposite. They are very comfortable and warm and very stretchy, I could have easily gone with a medium.",1
3,Would have liked elastic under the breasts for when it flips up in the pool. Separate panties. Looked more like a tennis outfit.,0
1,"I ordered a yellow tie, and it was supposed to arrive just in time for my homecoming. Unfortunately for me, the tie came in and was BEIGE. I ordered yellow, the package said yellow, but it. Was. Beige. Had to go out last minute and buy a different tie for a way higher price. The tie itself is fine quality and the patterning is nice, but the color is completely wrong. Very upset.",0
2,Cheapy material .. look for another option!<br />I ordered the orange color- good luck with the rest :D,0
5,"The material is light and good quality, almost a polished cotton.  Garment is well made.  Short-sleeved, which I want for summer.  It is long enough to reach my ankles, so it looks graceful on.  Very comfortable to lounge in now that the warmer days are here.  A reasonable price besides.",1
5,Got these on sale and they are wonderful,1
5,"I really like these boots. I was looking for something simple (no buckles, etc.), and these fit the bill. The leather is nice. The pebbling is subtle. They were just a bit loose in the ankle, but there wasn't any slouching, so it didn't bother me. I walked about 2 miles in them for the first wear, and they were quite comfortable. I got a small blister, but they're not broken in yet, so I think that will go away.",1
5,"So cute, luv them. Bought several different pairs of tropical drink and beachy earrings for girls annual beach trip. Cute, colorful, fun, worth it.",1
1,Too small,0
5,"It's compact, easy to use and even better, now I know what size shoes I'm looking for before I even get to the store.  But the best part?  I don't have to drag my daughter along and there's no more drama when buying shoes.<br /><br />What could be better than that?<br /><br />If portability isn't one of your main concerns, check out their Ritz Stick Foot Measuring Device.  We've been using them for ages and they used to be the only device you'd EVER see in stores.....long before the much more expensive Brannock device was even a thought in anyone's head.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, these folks have been putting out handy, inexpensive foot measuring devices since the 1960s which are considered to be the gold standard of the industry.",1
5,Larger than expected but very cute!,1
3,Doesn't stay comfortably,0
3,I need change for extra large. The large is small for me.,0
4,"Present for the girlfriend. Took about as long as expected to get to Australia - but then that's our issue for being in the middle of nowhere not Amazon's :(<br />Jumper looks good. Nice blue colour, just like the pictures. Fits well and feels comfortable (to touch, not sure how it feels to wear it!). Cool design which is just like the pictures. All in all, happy with the purchase, as was the missus!",1
5,"These sunglasses do exactly what I was hoping for, which they do not fog up while wearing them and that they are great with bright sunlight out. I have worn these everyday so far and I have not had any issues with them at all!",1
5,Looks small but fits just fine.,1
2,"Fits fine, super cute, but there‚Äôs this ridiculously strong rubber (almost weed) smell that hasn‚Äôt gone away in over A YEAR of having these. I‚Äôve tried leaving them outside to air out and they still smell. Incredibly disappointing.",0
5,"they came mildy tarnished but with a little baking soda, probably solved. No regrets, I wear them everyday.",1
2,Didn‚Äôt realize that it is made of shiny-ish spandex type of material,0
1,The threads on these do not hold the ball on..this is terrible while in the middle of a conversation my balls fall off and now I lost one already. Waste of money,0
2,"Purchased for a costume party, it was very hard to straighten the wig. It was back frizzy within a couple of hours.",0
2,"Strangely this bra is both too small and too large at the same time.<br /><br />The bra arrived and when I took it out of the package I immediately noticed the scratchy feel of the fabric.<br /><br /> I typically wear either a 36B or C depending on how the bra is made.<br /><br />The band was too small but the cups were way too big. The seller did include an extender so I probably could've worn that and adjusted the band size but with the fabric and cup issue, I didnt bother. The straps on this bra are nice and wide though so that was a plus.<br /><br />Overall, I dont think this bra is worth the price. Even if it did fit, the quality of the material just isn't there.",0
1,"Too small, seller would not refund money",0
1,Thin fabric. Does not look like photo.,0
5,Great,1
3,It fulfills its simple task.,0
2,Looks nice - detail stitching is very good.  But elastic stretches out after a few hours requiring retightening.  Over time (just a few weeks) the elastic is getting much weaker.,0
1,Lasted for two weeks and it tear itself apart,0
5,"This bra saved my self-esteem. After purchasing some pathetic nursing bras, I stumbled upon elomi bras.  I had lost hope that anyone made a nursing bra for those of us who have a lot going on (36F personally) and don't want the girls to be down to our belly buttons. It's bad enough that I cringe when I see the rest of my post-pregnancy bod, but the girls have to suffer, too?  No more!  This bra made me cry it fit so well!  And it looks great on, too!  The girls are back where they are supposed to be and I no longer feel dumpy.  This bra is a must purchase - seriously.  I have NEVER reviewed anything and I ran to my Mac to type this up the moment I tried this bra on.  Ladies, don't hesitate.  And yes, the clasps are different and don't unclasp by simply looking at them, but it is worth the extra second or two of effort...trust me.  I will be purchasing more elomi bras soon.",1
4,"The fabric has a soft buttery feel on your skin and the fit is perfect. The shirt is attractive and flattering on. However, the fabric is<br />also very thin and see through. I found the I need to wear a full tee-shirt under it or it just looks tacky.",1
5,This watch is wonderful for a preteen girl. My daughter loves it so much she would like it in other colors.,1
1,"Returned. Didn‚Äôt look like pic or even remotely good. It‚Äôs so busy it‚Äôs an ugly,  crazy hat.",0
2,Cheaply made,0
3,The gem got removed but it was mostly my fault. Don't shower while wearing them.,0
4,Runs a little small but looks nice on,1
1,not worth the money,0
5,Wings and necklace arrived I was surprised myself because it was so beautiful and match so many items that I wear I really really love this necklace,1
5,"It's very hard to find a turtleneck I actually like (I have a round face and they usually are very uncomfortable on my neck). This turtleneck is a good one. If someone that dislike turtlenecks in general likes THIS turtleneck, you're sure to like it. The material is stretchy, the color is exactly as pictured, and the neck is just loose enough that it doesn't feel like I'm being strangled by a very weak person all day.",1
5,I'm not really a hat wearer but this past winter I needed to wear a hat because of a new short haircut. This hat exceeded my expectations. My buddy who is an avid hiker saw it tried it on and immediately ordered one for himself,1
5,Cute cute cute!  It fits perfectly too.  So glad I purchased this.,1
1,Poor quality. Hope it‚Äôs shoddy design will last for more than one use,0
5,So cute! You never know when ordering from online but the material feels soft and its a very flattering design :),1
2,"If you think this sweater might be sage green, per the posting photo, guess again. It is the oddest shade of seaweed green mixed with undertones of blue-grey. Quite strange and brassy. However the construction of the sweater seems decent. The color remains offputting. Seller needs to revise image and NAME rather than hide color descriptors.",0
3,"I bought the 12 month size based on the reviews saying it runs small. I added a photo next to an item that is 6 month size. The arm holes are also different sizes, one is much bigger. I'll probably only use once for photos.",0
5,"Based on previous reviews, I ordered a medium as a 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 125lb woman. It fits perfectly and looks great on. I got just what I expected.",1
5,"This bag was purchased as a requested birthday gift as a replacement for an Ameribag that she has had for several years.  Being that lime green is her favorite color, she loves it and lucky for me the price in this color was at a discount  It is very well made, the style and shape is well known for its safety and comfort, and the leather is very soft and pliable.  I'm sure it will give her many years of stress-free use.",1
2,"The only problem was the chest area.  It has a built in bra type thing, I didn't know that.  At my age (59), my bust isn't that high anymore.  I tried hoisting up my bust up that high and it was uncomfortable and I came out of place as soon as I moved my arms. so going dancing in the dress wouldn't work.  Otherwise, it was very pretty, excellent construciton, very well made.  It's probably better suited to a younger person or a larger bust person.  I really wish it had fit me better.  I will definitely try a dress without the built in bra feature.  Thanks for making these dresses.",0
1,3 of the 7 reviews for this item use the word &#34;waggle&#34; to describe the product. Buyer beware because these reviews are fake and they're not even hiding it. SMH,0
5,Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the belt.,1
2,After a few days of wearing them. I noticed a hole in my sock,0
5,My granddaughter for her birthday she wanted the dress,1
5,Fabulous quality!  Well worth the buy!,1
1,"I wish I could give this zero stars. The printing was horrible pixelated, blurry and so dark you couldn‚Äôt even see the designs. The fir was super weird, short with a tiny neck but really wide. Weird slick material. All around just terrible quality, quickly got returned.",0
3,"Love the shoe horn functionality but the blue paint job is terrible. As soon as I opened the package the blue paint literally started cracking and flaking off without even touching the shoe horn. Since then, almost all of the blue finish is gone on the handle end of the shoe horn. Aesthetically it does not bother me as the shiny silver underneath is OK but the problem is the blue paint specks end up everywhere while using the product. At least until the paint is completely gone. Too bad, if the finish had been done properly I would have given the product 5 stars.",0
5,"My husband loves these! He has been wearing them every day. They are comfortable, yet they have some support. He is not able to wear his regular shoes at present, due to recent surgery, and these moccasins have been perfect!",1
5,Fits well. Nice colors. I love it!,1
3,I was going through a phase were I Really wanted this piercing but decided to try this instead.<br />It was cute and it helped me through my phase tbh tho I lost them LOL<br />I recommend if ur parents r strict :33,0
4,"Comfortable, non-binding",1
1,Material is cheap. Buttons are too. Collar doesn't keep it's shape and doesn't allow any inserts to be placed.<br /><br />Stitching was poor. A few buttonscame undone.,0
4,"I liked it - but it does seem to bind under my arms - however, I haven't worn it that much and maybe because it is new.  I bought it to wear under hiking clothes.  The hook fasteners (back) are somewhat noticeable (can feel them as I walk).  I may consider something (in the future) with front closing.",1
5,"gave this to my best friend, she love dandelions but she is allergic, so this was the perfect gift!!",1
1,Other people may like the fit but I like my hats not to puff up.  Additionally the bill seems to be out of proportion with the hat.,0
2,XL was too small for my 130 pound 5'9 daughter! ridiculous !,0
5,Prefect,1
3,fine looking but a little tight,0
1,"The hat is sold as a hard brim. Not!! This hat is flimsy and not worth 5. Not to mention 33.00. I would return it but it costs too much. I will chalk it up as a loss and toss it. Clearly, it is useless. Keep your money. It is not worth it.",0
5,"Soooo cute, wish this company made more of these Midi skirts instead of the maxi skirts",1
2,"This ""dress"" is so sheer it should not be called a dress.  It's a cover-up.  Very disappointing because, the fit was perfect.  This item was sent back.",0
5,Quality it‚Äôs really good and I love it !! Fits perfectly!,1
4,"My mom loved it. Easy to put on, waterproof. Very inexpensive for daily wear.",1
5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS!,1
2,"Huge cheap belt strings, just a huge blob of cheap material",0
1,"Wore it once, washed as directed, shrunk so bad I had to give it to my 11 year old daughter.",0
2,The color was amazing and the quality was great. If it wasn't so wide would have been the perfect product.,0
5,love the socks!!,1

5,"got married on the beach and it was a great accessory paired with a rose gold coral necklace & net sarong! so far metal had held up better than the necklace (being on the beach but not in ocean.) hoped to wear it on bicep area but no-go, so I wore it securely high on my skinny forearm- it was tight but comfortable~ love it!",1
2,Printing on shirt is very poor quality so is fabric,0
2,This band was everything I had hoped.  But after about 6 weeks one of the buttons fell off.,0
5,This is a great shirt for any Spartan to show their hate of that school in Ann Arbor.,1
4,Pretty mask and functional.  But it‚Äôs extremely hard to breath out of.  There are times I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm losing air from how thick it is.  Aside from that it works Atleast.,1
3,"Beautiful, but latching is nearly impossible.",0
5,I thought I was going too give as a gift . but I becided to keep it . I could still gift it though,1
4,good,1
2,"After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes up and the fit was OK.  The blue color though, is darker than depicted and the fabric is like canvas.  Also, the embroidery around the skirt bottom ends in the FRONT and there was a noticeable 3 or 4 inch space with no embroidery at all where the seam comes together.  With the apron over it, it would be ok, unless the wind blew.  I might have kept it even with these faults, but the fabric in the blouse and the apron is a heavy, scratchy, wrinkly cotton.  I could not tolerate it for a few minutes let alone for an entire Oktoberfest.  Sorry.",0
5,This dress was perfect!,1
3,"The color of the top was beautiful but when I tried it on the material is similar to tight leggings. The fit is slim, my arms were too tight, even buying a larger size I know I will have the same issue. I returned it, but overall is a pretty top.",0
1,There was one of the single rings completely broken the double rings are so flimsy I‚Äôm afraid they will break the first time i would even try to blow my nose. Very dissatisfied,0
1,"This t-shirt smelled like some type of high-potency chemicals. The heart in the middle felt like a big plastic shield on my chest that would quickly peel off. I washed it to see if I could make it better, NOT! I put it in the trash instead of returning it. Wasn't worth the trouble.",0
5,"My daughter is 11 bought size small ,perfect  fit .she love it",1
5,Ordered it as a gift for my bridesmaids and they are beautiful! Love them so much and I know my girls will. Can't wait I give it to them! I received them days before it was estimates for them to arrive!,1
5,This is my 2nd bag. I love this one. If u like pockets this is the one to get. I can fit a water bottle on both sides.<br />I‚Äôm not crazy about the decor I picked out. Only because it looks more kiddish. I got the black with orange flowers.,1
5,I wanted yellow and it‚Äôs the perfect color! Fits comfortably,1
4,nice,1
3,"They are very cute. But when they arrived, a couple of fruits fell off their posts so I have to get a glue gun or something to paste them back on. So I am a bit worried that they may fall off when I'm wearing them.",0

5,Good very good. Nice jersey store material. Looks authentic. Better than some NFL jerseys I've purchased. Excellent work. Thank you,1
5,Decal could be a little bigger.,1
3,"Ordered a medium, I'm 5'2&#34; 32B. Fits too big, might use it as a bathing suit cover for the summer.",0
5,"I will always purchase this brand, they last a long time and look cool.  I wear them to the beach, mowing the yard and wearing them in the mud.  I wear them when I should be wearing boots and they still do not fall apart.  Easy to clean up and they dry quick!",1
1,"Second hand sticking, unable to even keep accurate time.",0
2,"(1) fit is too short in the crotch (not enough room in the back), and (2) does not dry overnight",0
5,"I bought this for my boyfriend and it is absolutely amazing!! Not to heavy, very comfortable. He is a big man and wears a 3X so  finding something to go over the outside of all his other clothes is an issue most of the time, but not this time!! :-) The material looks to be very durable and it is super warm!! Can‚Äôt wait for him to test it out around our farm.",1
5,I'm a size 13 and these worked perfect.,1
5,These temple washers are a must if your temple arms are loose.  I placed one on top and bottom of each arm and now the temple arms do not flop around. Nice and snug. Package came with ten pieces. You use four each change and a couple extra in case you drop one.,1
3,"Fine, but after a while it started almost falling apart... . Not durable enough. Buy just for a cheap price.",0
3,I absolutely love these shoes! I wore them standing/walking 16-hours a day and they are truly comfortable. I only gave the product a three star rating because after 6-9 months of wearing them the insoles began to slip up towards the heel making them uncomfortable/unwearable. I may have wore them down quickly and wished they lasted longer.,0
2,can't keep it on my ear,0
5,Wonderful dress! Fit perfect and looked gorgeous on!,1
1,no way a flat chested lady could even fit  in this,0
4,Loved very comfortable,1
5,"nice little socks, fit good in shoes",1
1,Very disappointed. Only 2 out of 7 pairs worked. 1 of each earrings worked for 5 minutes and then didnt stay lit at all. My students were very disappointed! Would give zero stars if I could.,0
1,Cheap.  Caught on everything.,0
5,It's Beautiful and great quality !!! My fault I ordered the wrong size üò¢,1
4,I am 5&#34;6 220 pounds and the dress fits as expected. Not too small or tight. I like my cloths loose and not fitted. The loose fit perfect for me.,1
5,What a great versatile dress! I‚Äôve wore it to a luncheon and to court with complements on both occasions! This dress made me feel very confident as I know it fit my body well and I knew I looked good in it!,1
1,"These earrings are TINY. When I opened up the box I had to laugh, I ended up giving them to my 7 year old niece because there was no way they were going to fit my ears. Perhaps it was my error in not noticing the size description (if there was one), in addition to the laughable size, the clasps are nearly impossible to open/close",0
1,This turned immediately after my daughter put it in.  Caused her incredible discomfort and a mild infection.,0
4,Nice casual skirt.,1
5,La talla es m√°s peque√±a,1
2,Cheaply made,0
5,The rain jacket was just as described and I was very surprised how quick I receive.<br />Was a pleasure to do business with.<br />Thank you,1
3,"Look, there's nothing special or bad about these so I have no major complaints or praises. I wear them when I work out to help keep my hair out of my face. When I'm done I throw them in the wash with my towels.<br /><br />The 8 pack is great because you always have a clean one.<br /><br />They fit tight but loosen up after a few wears.",0
2,These looked kinda cheap and ran really wide in an 11. Couldn‚Äôt keep them on comfortably w/o gripping my toes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and 145 lbs. . Returned them.,0
4,"Very good quality, replaces old bracket that was broken.",1
1,They don‚Äôt expand much and it‚Äôs just elastic with a hole at each end.,0
5,These were a great deal for the price. They look very trendy and spice up any outfit. Very satisfied with this purchase.,1
5,Daughter is happy with it,1
5,I love this dress. I can be cute and comfortable. I have 3 different colors. Nice to throw on and go.,1
5,"Very nice dress. Bought it for a Hawaiian themed party.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a perfect fit and FYI if you have big boobas (I‚Äôm 40DD) but want to keep it buttoned up and want the fit to be more loose on the chest - order a size up. Otherwise, can be worn unbuttoned at the chest with or without a camisole underneath.",1
5,Exactly what we ordered and expected.,1
5,I love this bag. It is my everyday bag. Very light weight and just enough pockets. Quality construction. Lloks as good today as it did several months ago.,1
3,"I like the colors, and the quality, but I am 11 and they are too short at the end.... I wish they were longer",0
3,I like this product except for one thing..  the cord is way to fat to fit in the tiny little D clip on the side of my Canon 70D..  so I actually have to attach it to a clip made for full size harness rig I sometimes use..<br /><br />How are other people attaching this to their cameras?,0
5,This is my 2nd Calvin Klein hat and I love it! Great color!,1
2,These ARE light and reasonably comfortable.<br />BUUUT...I have always put my sunglasses on my hat when not wearing them. When doing that w these the lenses pop out easily and are not easy to put back in. Ended up throwing them out. I‚Äôll just pay the the extra $$ for prescription sunglasses.,0
3,"They are super soft and comfy. No compression in the stomach area at all. Picks up pet hair and lint like crazy. Overall, I would say good house leggings. A tiny bit see through",0
1,The glass is smaller than I excepted. I don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt recommend for others to buy.,0
2,"Charm is obviously not a charm suitable for a pandora bracelet as it is too large.  Very disappointed at the size.  The appearance is nice, just to large.",0
3,"It's a nice bag, but I should have read the product description better. It's way too small for me. Unfortunately I cannot return it because it will cost too much to do so. Sigh!",0
5,About the size of a quarter. Obsessed with them!,1
5,Truth size. Nice colors. My son love them.,1
1,This is opened right out if the bag.,0
1,"I really liked these leggings at first, but then I wore them to the gym and someone told me they could see my underwear. They're completely see through if you bend over, even the black ones, which I was wearing that day.",0
5,"I bought it for my son. He absolutely loves it. Eventhough the paper instruction needs microscope to be read,but it's very simple to be adjusted. The other good thing is it  comes with extra batteries.",1
5,Awesome pants. So comfortable and flattering.,1
5,This cover up appears just as expected. The colors are vibrant and the stitching is neat. Perfect as a beach cover up or paired with cut off jeans and a white tee. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.,1
1,I purchased the titanium 20g hoop but received a surgical steel one. My skin is sensitive and I can only wear titanium so I'm having to send it back.,0
5,much to my surprise this was more than I expected can't wait to wear it to the concert I purchased it for.  The color is amazing and I love the material,1
3,Was wider than I expected. Some reviews said it was narrow,0
1,I won‚Äôt call it large<br /><br />Even few bucks that I tried to fit in were stuck out,0
5,"I bought 3 of these bracelets, 2 with the smaller stones and 1 with the larger, all w/brown leather. All 3 were sized at 6.75"". The smaller stone pieces fit perfectly, the larger stone piece's size was too large, and I had to return it. This size difference was not substantial but made it too loose on my arm, and was especially noticeable when worn with one or both of the others. The larger stone & wider silver rim around the stone make for the need of a larger opening in the leather, so I'm guessing that is what caused the different sizing. This may make it a better choice for some people. The leather is probably the most beautiful thing about the bracelets. It is nice and thick, so It doesn't stretch out. The stones (I have the turquoise and the red) are thinly rimmed with silver that hasn't begun to tarnish after wearing it 24/7, as well as in water. They are priced pretty high, but the craftsmanship is top shelf, and I love both of them!",1
3,Ya very  tiny but cute,0
2,"This was a BRIGHT orange, not distressed like the picture.  Looks like something a hunter would wear- it's that bright.",0
4,"Stiff and heavy, otherwise I loved it.",1
5,Thank you we love it,1
5,Beautiful colors and patterns. Rich and beautiful quality.,1
5,"You can't go wrong with these, good quality and comfy fit",1
1,Sizing way way off<br />It would have fit a 8 year old not my 12 year old,0
5,"Perfect! I'm 5'3'', 140lbs and the medium fit perfect! Modest neckline and hit right below my knee. Arrived on time and after a light ironing I was good to go.<br />The great thing about this mustard is it can be worn in the fall with leopard or spring with bright blue. Lots of compliments.<br />No care tag but after washing and drying there was a slight shrinkage but still fit. The zipper bowed out a bit but the tie fixed it.<br />Will order another is a different color",1
1,They were too small.  I have now lost weight and decided to wash them after being in storage and the material is a disaster.  They are going into the trash.  Useless.,0
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This is nothing like the picture. It is literally just a piece of fabric with a couple leaves hot glued to it. This picture the hat is stuffed with cotton to stand up and the rim of the hat doesn‚Äôt hold shape either. You can literally go buy felt fabric and make a better hat yourself. Don‚Äôt buy it.,0
2,Order a large fit like Like a size M,0
1,Ordered a size small (for post pregnancy) and it‚Äôs fits like an XL (luckily since I‚Äôm pregnant it looks somewhat okay)!,0
5,I love it! So cute and simple! Couldn't even wait till Christmas to give it to my boyfriend. We've been wearing them everyday and night. It's just perfect,1
4,"The cuffs do not extend down the wrist as much as you see in the photos. Otherwise, fine.",1
5,Fits well. Lightweight.,1
3,Very beautiful. The silver rubs off fast. If you don't mind brass you will like it.,0
4,"Great lenses, fit my Oakleys perfectly. Keep them away from salt water though. Two days on the beach and the tint was peeling off.",1
5,This was perfect! I‚Äôm 5ft and wanted a tutu for these goofy pictures I did and didn‚Äôt want a super short tutu and this was perfect!,1
5,"OMG these starfish earring are absolutely the cutest earrings I have ever worn! They are light pastel colors, so they go with just about anything. The pictures are clear and colorful. Well made and a perfect size for my ears! I have worn them twice already (once at night when I was dressed up and once with jeans) and I received a ton of compliments and I was asked where I got them. These are great and I highly recommend them to all!",1
3,OK ORDER LARGER THOUGH.,0
1,The board did not have the correct numerical order and it was missing stickers of running backs they had duplicate stickers and no blanks,0
5,Good product,1
5,We use these for our photo booth business. They are very popular! Well made and look great!,1
3,"If you want jewelry for a specific occasion or only want to wear them a handful of times this is the product for you. I was hoping to keep them for a while, but they started turning black not long after I bought them.",0
5,Delicate and pretty,1
5,Love these - the pattern is super cute and they are so soft!  Definitely a great addition to my summer wardrobe - I can dress these up to wear to work or wear with a tank at home.  I will be buying more!,1
3,I have a small head and still I found the hat was too snug and therefore doesn't feel good. The color is good and the quality is good but the fit is not good. I would not recommend this hat due to the small size. It certainly isn't a one-size-fits-all hat.,0
5,Very nice product.,1
3,Doesn't have the same stone as pictured. Has a plastic multi colored bead. Looks pretty cheap and flimsy.,0
5,I got these earrings for my son for my birthday and I love them so beautiful.,1
5,"This dress is so comfy and cute to wear for anything, formal or for a walk, I'm in love it's so stretchy !",1
2,The hat came all folded up in a small bag. I never could get the shape back right to look like the picture. I ended up wearing a different hat to the derby so I didn‚Äôt look like my hat needed ironing.,0
2,Somewhat small and the armpit holes are weird.,0
1,"Just arrived. Took out of package for my daughter to try on and before I put them on her, jeans already had a hole in the leg. Very disappointed and will be returning. Hole looks like it has been pulled apart? Not sure but will be returning. Never put the jeans on for fit due to the damage. :(",0
5,"I really love the intricate design on the necklace, and the fact that the design is on both sides so I don't have to worry if it gets flipped over.",1
5, ,1
5,Fit perfect,1
5,"For starters, I hate doing reviews but I had such a good experience with this seller that I had to leave a comment. I initially went off other reviews when I purchased my pants. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and curvy/fit. I weigh 146 and my waist is a 27, hips 43. I thought the small would fit but they were so tight they smashed my butt in. The return process was so simple and communication with the seller was great! He/she always responded back within 24 hours and helped me with sizing. I paid nothing to return the items. I love these pants! High quality material and VERY cute! They make the booty pop! I ended up getting a medium and they fit perfect. There are a few materials on some of them that fit extra small. I had to get a large in the black knit ones! I will be buying my pants from this seller in the future! Highly recommend!",1
1,Looks cheap and is I‚Äôll fitting.,0
5,I wear them all the time in my ears,1
5,Love these shorts,1
1,I guess when I ordered these I didn‚Äôt think of them fogging up- I guess I figured they would be ventilated a little ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br />The fact that they got up doesn‚Äôt really bother me- it‚Äôs that they get all wet on my mouth and that grossed me out,0
4,"Nice colour, nice fabric, as it appears in the photo",1
1,Did not like this bra at all. Fabric was not what I expected. It was flimsy plus edges were not finished. Shame on that company for putting out such a crappy product.,0
2,"This look nice, but mine broke the first time I tried to put it on my tie. The pin was not attached to the body very well. RR",0
5,This housecoat was much fuller and MUCH longer than shown in the picture.  I returned it for these two reasons.,1
5,Beautiful!,1
4,Gift for my brother but he seems to like them and said he's been toasty on his bus/walk commute to work.,1
5,great gift for any age,1
5,I am loving every minute of my new glasses.<br />Very nice product for a reasonable price.,1
3,"Not a bad pair of cheap polarized sunglasses. They fit me fairly well. My only complaint is that one of the rubber ends fell off and I didn't notice so it's lost. I can still wear them, but not as comfy as with it.",0
1,The tooth fell off of the ring. 1 lasted 1 day the other last 3 days. Needs to be more secure on the top part that goes into the tooth part.,0
1,The top fabric is too stretchy and it stretched out under the weight of the bottom so it became see through after one use.,0
4,Love it.  The quality is nice but I wish the chain was a little longer. My husband has a big neck,1
5,"I love this pullover hoodie. It's a thick material that feels like it will hold up well to repeated washings. The color is a nice color with a mineral-washed prefaded look. The quality is fantastic for the price. I bought an XL, and it's roomy and cozy.",1
1,Band will not stay secure on the face. Too risky to use because it easily falls off.,0
1,"The suit is adorable, however, I agree with the rest of the reviews in they the green peel and fades almost immediately. So that was $80 down the drain...",0
5,"I used this for my hair to prom and I loved it! It's a great price compared to the others I looked at, but it didn't look cheap at all. I have really long, thick hair but it managed to stay in really well! I would recommend this product.",1
1,The material is very thin doesn't make you look fit at all big water of money,0
5,Great,1
5,nice shirt,1
4,I really like it.  It's not too small and not too big.,1
2,"It was pretty small and tight on me. I can still wear it, but only on certain occasions.",0
1,"I looked like a big square in this cover-up, just returned it.",0
5,"I am in love with this top I wear it every week it goes with anything very comfy, definitely worth it. ü§óü•∞",1
5,"Love these! My husband bought me these for Christmas and although I've tried many different brands, these are definitely my favorite. They fit well- without being too tight or causing any discomfort. They are also very fashionable. I've received compliments each time I've worn them. I will definitely be getting more from Maven Thread in the future.",1
3,"Didn't like the fit on me...not enough top for my top....if my boobs were a little smaller or the top portion was a little longer, i probably would have liked it.",0
1,[[VIDEOID:19e369d08b2abbea4895132dc4954f3c]] No es plata,0
5,Super cute- stays in place,1
3,Sunglasses and regular eye glasess,0
5,"I purchased these to make my LBD more interesting.  Previous reviewers mentioned they are heavy.  As I always wear stud or hoop type earrings, I was worried I wouldn't be able to tolerate the weight.  But I had no problems.  They are heavier than normal, but not so heavy that your earlobes get pulled down or cause discomfort.  The quality is amazing for the price - comparable to something you would find in a high end department store's costume jewelry department.  Had no issues with the crystals falling out or the backs coming loose.  I would definitely buy these again or buy them as a gift.",1
1,Believe missing. Mickey ears missing. Only hearts,0
1,"I loved the look, feel, and fit of these leggings......but",0
3,It‚Äôs small it‚Äôs not a plus size,0
5,So comfy,1
3,"Fits okay, a little too big and you can‚Äôt adjust it but very cute design and fun to wear.",0
5,It‚Äôs OK but the fabric could‚Äôve been better,1
2,Made fairly well.  Unfortunately been stored somewhere for a long time.  Leather is molded and brass hardware is corroded.,0
1,Have a return because I didn't get the suitcase set,0
1,Wayyyy too small. Can‚Äôt even get it over head and I‚Äôm only a small gal myself,0
5,Love it!,1
5,"Silicone is silky smooth and matte finish, the red stitching is excellent looking and done well. The matte black buckle is large but still looks good",1
1,"The holes on the lining of the hood where the buttons are supposed to secure it to the collar were really out of line, leaving ugly gaps between the collar and the hood. Also, it does not fit the way it looks like it would in the picture. It is too wide and strangely short. Overall, just a poorly made shirt.",0
4,"The boots are very cute! They kind of go in a little around the ankle, but not real noticeable.",1
5,Fast delivery. The laces are just what I was looking for. I will be ordering another pair in a different color for my other shoes. So glad you carry these!,1
5,great,1
2,It definitely runs large. A large felt like an XL. It has the potential to be really cute but it runs large and the fabric is itchy. I had to return it.,0
5,I can't sleep without it!  It soft and stays on my head.,1
3,"As the previous reviewer mentioned... it was not what I expected from a Travelon bag.  I too noticed what appeared to be the zipper locking clip was on the wrong side of the bag.  I called Travelon's customer service and they told me this bag was made specifically for QVC... so could be why the quality is a bit different.  I'm waiting for them to call me back and let me know if it's for a different purpose or just decorative.<br /><br />Unfortunately the threading was coming apart on the inside lining, however this allowed me to see the inside materials of the bag.  I was a bit shocked to see white plastic foam-like material was used to line the inside of the bag.  It's like the thin foamy cushy shipping material used to wrap fragile objects.  It's nice that it adds a bit of cushiness to the bag, but so odd!  Maybe it's part of their water repellant claim?  Definitely won't soak through to your stuff in there.  The polyester material does feel pretty sturdy, but not the same slash proof material I am seeing on other Travelon bags.  The netting on the side pocket is pretty flimsy and already gets stuck in the zipper.<br /><br />The style and size of the bag is perfect for what I'm looking for, but I'm contemplating on exchanging for a new one or just returning it.  That inner material bugs me for some reason.",0
5,I have my septum done but my mom don‚Äôt and she loves them,1
3,"These wedge sandals are true to size and comfortable, however, the heel strap is quite a bit bigger than it should be which makes it awkward feeling, thankfully for the straps that tie up your legs because they really hold the shoe in place. The downside is that these shoes are not as cute as I'd originally hoped they were. The material used on the wedge doesn't match the material used on the rest and the two materials just don't go together. Plus the wedge material has a huge noticeable seem in them.",0
1,There smaller than I thought they would be,0
5,Very good,1
3,The clasp comes undone sometimes but overall it‚Äôs pretty good for the price.,0
3,"The pack has plenty of storage places and options, and worked well, however, the straps on top were too short for my sleeping bag, and the buckles throughout aren't strong enough to withstand a strain. You get what you pay, and this will work fine for a weekend trip.",0
2,I liked the style but the scratchy fabric would be too uncomfortable to wear.,0
2,XXL Size not true fit.,0
5,"A great and beautiful bracelet.  Seems to be well made.  I would especially recommend this for the teenager in your life.  (Either male or female.)  As for as the size and how it fits, well read the description, it answers that question.",1
5,I wear a size 10 shoe and a lot of women's socks are small on my feet. Sometimes I buy men's socks because they are made larger. I am really liking these socks. I can't say much about the durability as I've only had them for a little while. They have only been thru a couple of washings. They are nice socks and well made. They are thick but not winter super thick. They are low cut but not no show. The socks come packaged well. Each set of socks is individually wrapped and all six pairs are in a zipper seal bag. I am very happy with the socks.,1
5,"I accidentally flashbanged myself with an IPL laser tool, and after the headache and temporary blindness from my retinas melting & remoulding in my head subsided, I ran to Amazon to buy these.<br /><br />They work & they're comfy.<br /><br />Not conducive to using the ipl laser on the face, but perfect for the body. My eyes are thankful.",1
2,The skirt fits but the top was giant. It also came snagged. If it wasnt for these problems I would of kept it since it is a really cute outfit.,0
1,The shirt did not look anything like the picture shown. It was short and no pockets,0
5,"Fit perfectly! I'm 6'1&#34; 200 lbs with an athletic build and this fit great! Usually sweatshirts are too wide, this one is more narrow.",1
5,I use these in the shower at my gym to avoid athletes foot and other general grossness that may exist in a public shower. They dont absorb water which is great because they can go right in your gym bag when you're done getting dressed. A must have.,1
5,Love them. Comfortable and fit perfect..,1
5,It's simple yet effective necklace!! I love it!!!,1
1,These are ridiculously see through. I only paid $8 for both pairs but had I known they were *that* bad I wouldn‚Äôt have even spent the $8. Truly terrible product.,0
1,It was all tarnished and discolored,0
5,I was spectacular when I ordered this. But once I received it. I was very happy. This is great for packing and then putting into a suitcase. My jeans fit perfectly into the large size. Then I put shirts in the medium. More shirts in the next size. Then under garments in the smaller one. I love it how everything just fits right. Makes traveling so much easier.,1
2,"I really wanted to love this dress, especially since it was only $10! I read the reviews and had high hopes because people said it was a beautiful red and thick material. I did not find that to be the case for me. The red is not a darker red as the photo indicates, it's more of an orange-red, sort of a hybrid between their orange and red photos in the color options, definitely not a holiday red like I was hoping for. The material is thicker than most of the cheap dresses/tops sold on Amazon, but not thick enough that your bra doesn't show through.<br /><br />For size reference, I ordered a large. I'm 5'4, 175lbs, 36DD. It fit okay in the bust, but the waist and skirt were too loose and looked a bit baggy. It was also too long, hitting around the knee which just looked awkward...like it should either be shorter or longer. The whole thing was very unflattering for my figure, so I'm sending it back.",0
4,"COMFORTABLE, NICE ARCH.",1
5,I do MMA and these were surprisingly durable and tough,1
4,Love everything about this dress. A lot of compliments,1
1,"Not crazy about it,  didn't realize how small it it.",0
4,"My Grandson loves anything, and everything Cars.  Decided at the last minute to get this 2-piece pajama set for him.  He wears a 4T and the closest size was a 4...I took a chance and ordered it.<br />Overall, they fit as expected.  The top fits great however, the pants are long.  As a result, he doesn't wear them, only the top...Which is fine with me...He loves it.<br />Highly recommended for sure!",1
5,A+++++,1
3,"The color the flowers are pretty, you can get a nicer quality dress and Ross, TJ Max, for the same price. It‚Äôs pretty for a cheap dress, which should cost like $10, I‚Äôm returning becasue it didn‚Äôt fit, cheap looking too.",0
1,"Be warned that these bags each hold ONE shoe each (unless you've got flip-flops).  Seem to be great quality, but I'm going to have to find a use for them other than holding my shoes when I travel.  I felt really misled when I got them.",0
5,"These are very comfortable and lightweight. I didn‚Äôt realize they have pockets in the shorts, but I love them! I got the floral pattern, Buffalo plaid, and a Halloween set. Probably will get more of them too! (I wear a size 10 usually and got a M. They fit a 40-30-44 frame well (not tight at all).)",1
1,Very poor quality and seller would not take back.,0
2,Wish it came in x-small. I'm 5'2 120 lbs and the small looked ridiculous. Might look better on curves or larger women.,0
5,Made these long strips to make a wall division I still sewed them together yet the cement was perfect to keep them in place before sewing.,1
5,"Really gorgeous set! LOVE them, will most likely buy some other colors, Thanks!  üëèüòÅ",1
5,Will wear to work in winter time & short sleeves in summer time,1
5,Gorgeous ring very deep blue love it thank you AmazonüòÄüíôüòÄüíôüòÄüíô,1
5,It was Absolutely beautiful it doesn‚Äôt look like a chain it looks like jewelry,1
5,"Fits perfect, I have a narrow foot.",1
5,This is a gorgeous watch.  I bought it for myself but I'm giving it to my husband for Christmas instead.,1
5,"Wonderful product, fit as shown.",1
1,This bathing suit would be great if you have a very short torso. I sized up to the large because I‚Äôve had that problem before in these bathing suits and they still don‚Äôt fit. PS I‚Äôm not a large normally a small or a medium so that made the chest too big but it‚Äôs still didn‚Äôt fit right.,0
5,The dress was just as I expected. The fit is nice and good quality,1
1,Runs very very small. I bought a large and it's more like an extra small. Pretty but not worth it.,0
5,A sturdy umbrella with room for two! I love the design,1
5,This dress fits like a dream!,1
3,Eh<br />It looks great feels great and handles pretty well.<br />Durability isnt the best only 2-3 weeks of occasional use and the stitching is ripping showing the second layer of the ball.  Multiple areas where this has happened.  Anyway the ball is good but not the most durable,0
5,Cute dress,1
5,"Cute, and light enough to use as a keychain which was my plan!",1
1,Poor quality and looks very cheap!,0
5,Daughter loved it!,1
1,It looks super cheap. Didn‚Äôt even bother trying it on.,0
1,Wrong color. Was actually purple.,0
4,Fits perfect but too short.  I'm 5'8.,1
4,They fit; they're a good price. All my cards in just one insert--great.,1
5,I hate wearing masks but this one is very comfortable and cute too.,1
1,"Loved my joggers and only got to wear them once, washed them as directed and my joggers faded out horribly. Very disappointed with the material.",0
5,Great quality socks.,1
5,Great fit for the mini! She wanted matching glasses like mommy. They fit her great and came nicely packaged!,1
4,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and the legs on these were still very long. If your vertically challenged you‚Äôll need scissors.,1
5,The design is very nice and it has even better price.,1
5,My niece loved this jumpsuit so cute.,1
3,"I'm a pretty small girl, but my chest is 34DD. I bought it expecting to be able to wear it with a pencil skirt, but the fabric is definitely not meant for that kind of look. I think the sweater is best for really cold days because it is very warm and it does leave a bit of room. Overall a good sweater, just not for what I expected it to be!",0
5,Love it works well! I work 3rd shift and it helps keep me up all night. No one even notices I'm listening to music.,1
5,Beautiful necklace.,1
2,"There is no neck to speak of, so getting this to stay down in your top is a challenge. Also, after dark (trick or treating), it becomes impossible to see through. He could see fine during the day, so we had no warning that he wouldn't be able to see before he couldn't see at all and his costume, and evening, was ruined.<br /><br />I bought the adult size and it was really snug on my 9-year-olds face - nose squishingly tight.<br /><br />Because of poor fit plus the visibility issue, I'm only willing to give this two stars, and that's only because it's not sewn poorly or completely misshapen.",0
5,We bought these shirts for our grandson's fifth birthday next month so he has not tried them on yet.  They are a nice quality and appear to be an accurate size 5/6,1
5,"I am always skeptical when it comes to buying clothes without trying in before. These are perfect in every way. Soft, comfy, stretchy yet flattering, good for relaxing, and cute enough to wear to the grocery store. I ordered an XL because all the reviews said to size up. I'm 5'8"" and 150lbs. These are fitted but have wiggle room.",1
4,Standard sunglasses with a little flare. I often get complements on them.,1
2,"I LOVED this tunic for wearing with leggings and it is so flattering, but it got a hole in the sleeve after the second wear.  I am so disappointed because I loved it.  I had been contemplating buying in black as well, but I have decided I won't be buying another because shirts should last longer than two wears.",0
5,Dress is well made and fits nice,1
3,"Purchased for my 5'3&#34; 12 year old daughter who typically wears a women's small-medium. Ordered the 14, but when it arrived, the head opening was so small she couldn't get it over her head. There is no button or way to increase the size of the opening either. When I was thoroughly examining it to make sure I hadn't missed something... Well let's just say it fit perfectly over my cats head, if that provides a better image of how small the opening was. I realize these are Asian sizes, based on petite Asian women, but unless these women have shrunken heads, it's entirely unclear how anyone could wear this shirt and I sincerely hope this was just a sewing mistake.<br />Well reorder in a larger size and see what happens!",0
5,"I love this romper.. the material is strong and thick but soft and not see through..I am 5""8 180lbs and I got the large..It fit to perfect..but i want mine to be a little loose..so I am returning and getting a xl..and more colors..let's just hope that the XL is not too big..",1
3,Cute. It runs small compared to other shirts from them,0
3,"Love jacket style, but only room for long-sleeved tee shirt. Body & inner elbow too tight for sweatshirts. Left side (European style?) zipper. Suggest order larger size than usual.",0
5,"Great glasses! My only  complaint is that the rubber eventually began to pull loose from the  ear pieces. I've tried to glue them, but they don't hold. Otherwise, I love the glasses.",1
2,The fabric was rough and that in its self was disappointing. The design was beautiful. The fit was great (S) but the elastic bands that went around the breast to the waist then arms was very rough.,0
5,"Super comfy. Sooooo cute. Feels like Lulu material. Still breathes. My 5 y/o wears them under her dresses. She wears a 5T in clothing. We used to get into HUGE fights over wearing shorts or bloomers under dresses and rompers every morning. These immediately solved the problem. Now she wears them even if she‚Äôs not wearing a dress (with jeans, shorts, and everything else.) LOVE!! Ordering two more sets right now.",1
5,"Hat fits as shown in photo. Not for tiny ones...my son is in 24m. It is unbelievably cute though! Love the cowl neck - works wonders in place of a scarf. Face opening is small enough that he can't easily pull it down. I have washed it once and hung to dry. Held up just fine. Shipping is not quick, but super cute and priced well!",1
2,"The skirt looks good and I like the style.  However, it‚Äôs made from a very cheap jean material and runs slightly big.",0
2,"Really cute,  but cheaply made. My daughter dropped it in the bathroom and the glass shattered",0
1,It did not fit in the Liv frames that I purchased them for.,0
5,"Great dress, love the stretchy back, MUST USE A PETTYCOAT otherwise it looks flat",1
5,Son loves it and very happy!,1
5,Had an issue with this watch. Called BC/Surf Sport about the problem. They went beyond my expectations to fix the issue. Would reccomended buying from them!,1
1,"I ordered an XL since I am pregnant and the fit was horrible and barely reached my ankles. It is not worth the 24,99 and I will be returning.",0
3,"Very cute blouse, but runs small. I usually wear a XL, but ordered a XXL so it'd fit loosely w/wht capris. I could not even get it on and I actually have medium shirts that fit bigger than that. On the bright side it is a very very cute shirt",0
5,Me encanto,1
3,I couldn't wear it but its pretty enough. Only wish it was a lot larger. My 18 yr old size 4 cousin is enjoying it greatly.,0
2,Cute. Bigger in person than I thought they‚Äôd be. Cons are that they are super foggy smudgy lenses. I used cleaner both wet and dry and nothing worked. They broke in half. Super frustrating.,0
5,Fits great  comfortable thanks,1
5,Very light and seem well made. Quality seems as high as the Oakley or Revos I also have. For $20...very hard to beat.,1
5,I was skeptical about buying a shirt from Amazon as I am unable to try the shirt on.<br /><br />I was happy when the shirt arrived. It is identical to the description and picture. It also fits great. The shirt is soft and durable. I would recommend buying from this company again.,1
1,The dress was very large and ugly.if you do want to buy this dress I would suggest you go down 1 or 2 sizes .,0
2,Had a large whole in it.,0
5,Great fit,1
2,"This is a package of three Cotton Spandex bike shorts. The fit is good. One huge problem that renders them unusable. When the shorts were made they were made out of two different colors of pink fabric. One pair is bright pink on the right side and a softer pink on the left side. One pair is bright pink on the left side and a softer pink on the right side. The third pair is without issues. I tried to get the company to remedy this for me but was unsuccessful. However being FBA, Amazon stepped in and did an awesome job for me. To Amazon I give 5 stars. To these shorts, I give them to the garbage man. That may sound harsh but I tried to fix this appropriately and did not succeed.<br />I received these at a discounted price for my honest review and feedback and they aren't worth the discounted price. Sad.",0
3,they were warped when arrived and you can not adjust,0
3,"received quickly, but the frame‚Äôs integrity was questionable. It was certainly quality Persol glasses, but the frame came defective.",0
2,My son bought this to use as a missionary. It lasted for his six week training period but now both clasps holding the shoulder strap have broken.,0
4,I'm 5'10 and the dress hit me lower mid thigh. Seems to be decent quality.<br />My husband loved it. Hides all the lumpy spots.<br />Came quickly and just as described.,1
2,"I have a small head, and this is pretty tight.",0
5,These are awesome. I was a little suspect of them because of the price but they are amazing. The fit is awesome and they have a great look to them. I'm going to buy a few more of these bad boys for me and the Mrs. The price is just icing on the cake. Nothing like having new workout gear to motivate you.,1
4,I wear a 12. The length was perfect (I'm 5'2) - it hit right at the knee.  It isn't see through at all.  The arm openings are huge. I have to wear a tank underneath to hide my bra on the side.  Straps are thick enough to hide bra straps. May want to consider a bralette to wear with this.,1
4,I brought this to go along with my Egyptian outfit. This headpiece is very nice. It fit on my head pretty good. The chains did seem not to line up on both sides but I have a big head so that may explain it,1
5,I‚Äôd be looking for a little extra something for under a shirt. This is so inexpensive and so cute! Can‚Äôt wait for sweater weather. I‚Äôll be wearing this allllll the time.,1
5,Came exactly as expected. Loved it :),1
3,It is ok for the price,0
5,Purshased for my 6yr old daughter. They are cute the material feels light and soft. It fits her very well she likes that all she needs to do is pull it up when she's entering a store. She also got compliments on how cute her face covering was.,1
2,"I'm 5'2 barely maybe 210lbs, ordered a 3x and it was too large and easy too long.  Haven't ordered any other styles or name brands other than What Waist in which there's no comparison at all.  I would've ordered a smaller size but I chose to try a different brand.  Good luck",0
5,She loved it,1
5,Girlfriend loved and is a great quality charm !! Pandora beads can be pricey these are a great deal for similar products!,1
2,not great product to invest..it's nothing like shown..no flare nothing..disappointed..,0
5,Party accessories,1
5,Really liked this but hope you make these pajamas with the Barbie design in bigger sizes please,1
5,Fast shipping and perfect,1
3,It is very tight and I ordered it a size bigger than what I wear. It takes two people to lip it up.,0
1,"Great looking belt and initially loved it. But after wearing this belt daily for about a month, the buckle broke.  The pin holding the metal hinge on the buckle just fell out and the buckle fell apart.",0
1,I was very disappointed with the fit. The fabric Is a shinny material not of good quality.,0
5,Beautiful necklace and excellent service.,1
1,New??? This has brown nasty spots all over it straight out of the package üòî,0
3,does not run true to size :(,0
2,Not professional work pants. Material is similar to spandex.,0
5,Loved this bag - worked perfectly with a pair of shoes I was trying to find a pocketbook to match for over a year.,1
4,This was very cute and fit as expected. I will be saving and using for my second daughter on her first birthday.,1
5,Cleaned up the necklace I wear daily so fast. Embarrassed that I let it get as bad as it did. The time it took to clean and polish was about 3 minutes.,1
2,"The chain was broken when I opened it and I was able to fix it by bending some wires, I was disappointed in the length of the earrings.",0
1,"Like some, ended up with what appears to be a knockoff. Pattern is not the same as depicted, poor copy, and the material was stiff, not loose as mentioned in the web description. Returning and will try another seller, as I really like the pattern as shown on the web. Was hoping to wear to a function this weekend! :-(",0
1,Poor quality. My leggings were made with end fabric and had a white streak down the inseam.,0
2,"So disappointed, this dress does not look like it appears I will be wearing it around the house or maybe a grocery store run.",0
1,I ordered a size larger than I wear and they were still too small. Soles felt thin as well.,0
5,"Sure as heck beats spending $300+ dollars on a pair of prescription sunglasses. My glasses are pretty big, but these sunglasses fit over them perfectly.",1
5,"This dress was just what I wanted. the material is soft, feels very good on the body. im 5'4 150lbs and 36c bust I ordered an 8. fits perfectly. im smaller on the hip area and that's what I loved about this dress. it fits me perfectly. if you have a bigger bust and a smaller bottom this is the way to go. I got this dress in several colors and enjoying each one. I received many compliments and oh, hubby loved it too!!!!",1
5,"I liked everything about it, thanks.",1
5,My 7 yr old granddaughter absolutely loved it!,1
3,Ran small,0
1,[[VIDEOID:9d7d4ddf586025c65d5f6ccf5c0f7cd9]] False advertising...NOT STAINLESS STEEL!! Tarnished after 2-3 day wear! Probably have better quality at the Dollar Tree.,0
5,Glasses are light weight and can be conveniently stored in a small purse.,1
5,Nice and durable,1
2,It is missing the clasp to buckle the strap.,0
3,Cute but not for kids. There to big,0
1,Will not hold air. Tried everything to make this work. Was very disappointed! There is no way to keep it tight enough around the waste or the legs to keep the air in. I even tried string around the bottom of legs to hold in the air and it still wouldn't keep enough air in for the neck to stay inflated. Wanted to use these in a 5k color run for a costume contest but it was a bust!!!üò°üò°üò°,0
5,NICE!,1
4,look fabulous,1
1,Very bad quality. It was torn after first use. Would not recommend it.,0
5,"I was skeptical about ordering a size 4 since number sizes are a hit or miss for me. I‚Äôm normally a size small, 32D for reference. Happy to say the size 4 fit perfectly! Love that there is removable padding. Offers medium impact support so great for moderate work outs but better for lounging around. If you‚Äôre familiar with NVGTN‚Ä¶this top is very similar to their infinity sports bra. Looks awesome paired with high waisted leggings or shorts. Be aware though, the cut is pretty low so expect the girls to be on display. Not recommended for the modest type. Overall, excellent workmanship, very comfortable and figure flattering. My new favorite go-to and will definitely be ordering more colors!",1
4,Gorgeous dress. I wear a medium but order a small because I am dieting and thought it might fit a little big. Wish it had been a tad smaller. But I did love the dress :). Wore it to a beach wedding!,1
1,"I wish I heeded the warnings from other sellers. I also wish I could return them! I wonder what type of business can get away with creating a product that does not have correct sizing. For someone that usually wears a medium, I ordered the xxxl and one pair fit. The other 5 pairs are wayyyy too small. What's up with the size variations?!?  What a waste of $20!",0
5,Shows well! Well made Item.,1
4,"Nice shades, very comfortable. One of the rubber ear pieces pulled off. I don't know if it stuck to my head or pulled off when I took them off but I noticed it is missing.",1
1,Half of them didn't work.,0
5,He loved them thank you,1
5,Good product. I would purchase it again,1
3,"Too small. Barely fits her now, DEFINITELY not going to fit her by the time she turns 2...",0
2,Not what I expected. Cheap made. Very thin.,0
5,I really like this product for my aftercare. I use this faithfully on my piercings and it healed properly with this. Its very soothing. It's good for nose piercings as well because it helped with a tiny bump that I was forming on the inside of my nose and it completely healed for me. I am here again to place another order of it. This worked better for me than the more expensive stuff. I'm glad they sell this here.,1
4,Great can't wait to get another pair as soon as their available,1
5,Bought these for my 18 year old niece. She wears them all the time. Genuine leather and 3 colors for the price of one. Considering ordering some for myself.,1
5,"The fit was perfect.  In the cool California winter, these pants were warm in the morning.  The length was very good.  The heather color was great; like old-fashioned heather.  I'll buy more.",1
5,My girlfriend loves these and they fit great. I think they're very nice.,1
5,I've gotten so many compliments on these shoes! They're definitely my new favorites üòç,1
2,Really really cheap looking- I have gotten better looking things at the dollar store. They do come quick though!,0
1,"I like the red shirt I received but that was the only shirt I got, there wasn't a black one with it. I got a refund and purchased different colored shirts from same seller and they should arrive today, fingers crossed",0
5,This belt of great quality and very sturdy. I like how well it's made and the fabric doesn't fray around the belt rivets. Only thing I might change is the spacing between the holes. They could be a little closer together to accommodate those random weight gain/loss days.,1
5,This shirt has a flattering fit for all sizes. It‚Äôs comfortable and loose. Considering getting additional colors,1
5,Extremely attractive even on weman,1
1,Size is not true to fit. I recommend getting 1-2 sizes larger than normal.,0
4,"Brilliant little clip.  However, it is large.  When making it into a paracord bracelet it ends up being quite bulky for womens sizes but works well for someone with a larger wrist or for working into a belt.",1
4,"Overall I like this suit. It's a different way to wear a two-piece and it takes a little getting used to but it's really nice and modest without being as grumpy as a lot of mom suits. This does run a little small in the bottom. I am 5&#34;7, 140lbs and have 3 kids, youngest is 1. I have mom belly build and this is nice and supportive in the lower tummy area. I normally wear a medium but I ordered a large in this and I'm glad I did bc a medium bottom wouldn't have fit. The bottom fits perfectly on the top half. I deducted one star bc I feel like it's cut a little odd on the bottom- the crotch is a little too square so it's baggy just slightly in front and the leg holes are just slightly too tight for a large so they give me a little leg muffin which I don't love. The top has a little padding but nothing crazy and it's adjustable tie straps so nothing to complain about there. The print is vibrant and flattering. I will wear this.",1
3,"Band looks great with my Vivomove HR, but it has fallen off twice in the first four days of wearing. It seems as if the pins used in the replacement band are just a bit smaller than the Garmin pins.",0
4,"I love the skirt, the color, the flow and the design.  The only issue I have is SIZING. I have returned several of them because the sizing is about 2 clicks &#34;off&#34;; where I normally wear a size large, I have to order this product 2 sizes larger.",1
5,"Easy to install, to clean and very comfortable",1
4,"We bought this to look like old-fashioned sleepwear for my 12 year old to wear in a play. It worked great for the role, but she also likes wearing it to bed because it is soft and comfortable. It's not ""cool"", but it's pretty and nice quality.",1
5,Well made!,1
5,looks cute on my daughter.,1
4,The bag is just the right size and it holds a lot.  I used packing cubes that I had to help with the organization.,1
2,"You get what you pay for.  These glasses were less than $10, including shipping.  I only ordered them so that I could test if I liked bi-focal glasses for driving my car.  I didn't, so this $10 saved me from spending several hundreds on prescription bi-focal driving glasses.",0
4,"Works like it's supposed to, but the white color is not very bright...fyi.",1
3,Bought the belt for my bf who wears his belt below his belly.  I think he just pulls it too tight as what happened is where you put one end of the belt into the teeth and lock that down it keeps ripping off and he ended up doing this 4 times before I finally said let's just send it back.,0
1,"Ridiculous.  I should have taken a cue from the 2 pervs who reviewed before me that these are trash.  I am a size 6 and ordered a large as these were reviewed to run small.  What I pulled out of the small beef-jerky-esque package was means for a small doll.  Not a human.  No person could wear these.  I don't have any idea why they are sold as regular, seamless panties.  What a joke.",0
3,"Sweet shirt, way too small for 3xl. 3xl is more like an xl. Super cheap shirt.",0
1,"I hate leaving bad reviews because it makes me feel like a karen but this jacket is just not it. It's not soft it's scratchy, it picks up any and every piece of hair or lint in the room, it fits really strange and pokes out in weird places. The location of the ears is funky as well... just spend the extra few bucks and go for a better one. Bummer, because I was really looking forward to this jacket!",0
5,This is my 2nd pair and they are the best alongside stance socks for there quality. I am in need of the compression aspect as I am on my feet all day and they keep me going for the mile!,1
5,Got this as a gift for someone and they love them. So cute and easy to wear,1
1,"I have three pairs of this style in another brand and the quality between this brand and the ones I already have is night and day. These are super thin, see through, zero compression anywhere and very unflattering. I knew they were garbage as soon as I took them out of the package. I wear a medium in almost everything and these felt super big as well, so it‚Äôs not as if I bought them too small. Save the time it will take to return them.",0
5,Love Them  !!!!!,1
3,Narrow width to this brim .. only covers directly in front of your face.  No shade at all from the side.  Also.. brim is shorter than what it looks like in the photo. Well-constructed and nice crown .. too bad it doesn't really shade.,0
5,"Excellent quality, excellent price.",1
3,30 degrees outside and my hands got cold on my quad.,0
4,"I typically always carry a large bag, because I feel the need to carry a lot of things with me. So, this bag seeme to be perfect.  Right off the bat I noticed that it had a nice look to it, like real leather.  It has shiny gold studs and diamonds on the side, and a paisley interior. It has matching gold colored hardware with buckle straps. The overall look of the bag in person is really nice.<br /><br />It has three large compartment. The first one has two cell phone type pockets on the side, the second middle pocket has a zipper to keep it closed, and the third has a small zipper pouch on the side. Plus the bag also has a small zipper pouch on the outside as well (see pictures). I carry make-up, my wallet, tissues, a small notebook planner, tablet, glasses, pills, cell phone and more. EVERYTHING  fit in it, with plenty of room to spare!<br /><br />At first I was very happy with the bag, and still do really like it. The only problem is that because it's so large, it takes me a while to find anything that I am looking for. I have many large bags so I'm used to this problem, but it was particularly difficult with this bag.  Other than that one inconvenience I am very happy with it.<br /><br />I received a discount on this bag in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, and all opinions are based on my personal experience with this Diophy PU leather studded bag.",1
3,"The quality material and the fact that it has the bra hook at the back was what captured my interest to purchase this sports bra. Regrettably, it didn‚Äôt fit. I wear a size 34A bra and so I bought the small, which is the smallest size available. It fit but it didn‚Äôt hug the way a sports bra should. I think it‚Äôs because the small, like the other sizes, fit a range of sizes.",0
2,One lens wouldn't stay up so it was a bit wonky having 1 lens that didn't do up & was lose,0
2,Huge! Got these for my 2 1/2 year old son. He is average size. These were huge on him and he didn‚Äôt like the way they are hooked together with the string.,0
1,Dear lord this is a terrible purchase!,0
3,"a bit small, ok for a youth.",0
3,"I actually bought this for my hairless guinea pig. She's similarly sized to an adult rat. It's a cute sweater, but it doesn't stay on well. The sweater itself is basically a straight rectangle and doesn't account for the curve of the animals body. I had rats before and I know this wouldn't have stayed on any of them either.",0
2,&#34;Silver&#34; one broke...got it Tuesday (5 days ago).,0
3,"The quality of these lounge pants is very good, very soft, very good colors and super inseam length. The waist tie is wide so it will be difficult to lose it inside the pants - this is a plus. In my opinion, they do not quite fit to size, based on other lounge pants that I have from other manufacturers of 2XL. You may want to order the next size larger than your regular size.",0
2,Super  cute tee with the perfect stretch.,0
4,"Super soft, comfy and warm.  Surprisingly breathable.  No stretch in the material so check size info carefully, or just do like me and buy big.  I will say I have a long torso, but these are cut generously so I could have sized down.<br />As with all onsies, remember you basically have to get naked if you need to potty, but this doesnt bother me.  Its  as free feeling as being wrapped in a fuzzy blanket that doesnt let in any drafts.",1
5,Awesome glasses! Got the smallest size.,1
4,Beautiful and worth the price better than I expected,1
5,"I love these socks, I wear them even when I am not doing yoga",1
5,I usually fit in large but XL was a great fit. It‚Äôs a good looking shirt. Basic style combo would be this shirt plus blue jeans plus chukka boots and men necklace. Wore this in Miami and Houston and got a lot of compliments.,1
5,"Beautiful color, unfortunately I ordered too small of a size and they fall out of my ear.",1
1,I did not get what was pictured‚Äîthey are really small‚Äîwon‚Äôt even cover your nose!<br />And it took forever to get them. They said it was because they were celebrating a holiday‚Äî,0
4,"For the price this is a great watch bracelet, though it was a pain in my --- to get this on my mdv 106. My recommendation is just keep trying! The curved end link had some damage(pictured) but was easily fixed. I do recommend this and the seller.",1
1,Got a large for a an oversized look.<br />It‚Äôs just a size large that is a little longer and the arms look too big.<br />Plus side the design is cute and clear and the fabric is very soft.,0
4,"im a medium and it would have fit better in a small. returned because I didn't like the fabric or the stitching across the bottom of the stomach, guess its okay if you wear a belt.",1
3,ok,0
5,These glasses are even better in person. The frame is solid and full of great detail. The metal accent across the nose is a nice addition. I wear these as safety glasses for work and could ask for a better and more stylish frame. Delivery was fast and better than I expected.,1
3,"I thought these were going to be similar to https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TCLEPO0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />However, the purple part starts just before the metatarsophalangeal joint, so the toes dont have the same compression material, which makes it a little less comfortable than the other style from Nurse Maids",0
2,"I buy, relatively, a lot of cheap clothes on Amazon in this kind of style - I know not to expect too much and usually just return what doesn't work out but this is sooooo poorly made it's embarrassing. It's the worst material I've ever encountered and it's tight sleeves but then just looks like a garbage bag on your torso and it's totally unfinished. I can't imagine a single person this would work on.",0
5,Fits perfect and stylish,1
5,Nice cap,1
5,"Love this headband and I get lots of compliments on it. The color in the picture is accurate...it's an olive green, very neutral.  It is soft, but stays on my head.  I bought it to keep my short, curly hair tamed down, but my daughter has taken it over for her long,straight hair.  Kudos to being stylish enough for a mom and her teenage girl.",1
3,somewhat big but warm!!,0
4,They are comfortable and well made.,1
2,"Fit is great, but color is distorted and not as pictured. What was supposed to be a black floral print skirt is actually a grey/blue floral print. Noticeably different, like two different styles sewn together.",0
5,"These are really pretty and Sexy , especially in the bedroom honey loves when I wear it",1
3,"Although these shorts are well made and I like material of the short itself, I found the front of the shorts to be just a tad too short for me.  I am also not crazy about the high waist which is made from a spandex like material and feels a just a bit too constricting.<br /><br />Size wise, I purchased a small and at 5‚Äô7‚Äù 125 lbs, they fit me well so I would say they are true to size. There are also 2 waist pockets, a small one in the front that would your keys and not much more (see photo) but unlike the one in the back it does not zipper or fold over so items could potentially fall out. I found the inner briefs to be comfortable and sized proportionate to the shorts.  They are not see through, even in white so that‚Äôs another plus but overall, although I‚Äôm sad to say this, these shorts just weren‚Äôt for me.",0
5,grand daughter is in love with owls these were amazing,1
3,Ad didn't match up with actual fit. Purchased as fun gift for older adult. Got the laugh I was after but man...it was a tight fit for an average adult head size.,0
1,I‚Äôm having trouble keeping the band tight.,0
5,"I had stopped wearing post earrings because they drooped so much and didn't look at all good. These have me wearing those again, very easy to use and now my earrings on my ears are where they should be. I would recommend these to anyone that has this problem.",1
3,ok,0
4,I like this a lot. Living in the south rarely need a heavy duty bathrobe. This is just a great weight. I like the sleeve length since I putter around in the kitchen in it at breakfast.,1
2,This item was well packaged and came in a nice box however there was a scratch on the upper  right corner of the wallet. Since the package wasn‚Äôt damaged it seems like the item came straight from the manufacturer with these scratches. I‚Äôm disappointed and considering returning the item as I intended it to be a gift.,0
1,The quality of these pants is lacking.,0
5,"Not tight or itchy like an elastic band, these &#34;slap bracelets&#34; for mounting wrist corsages work great and hold up through the night at a formal dance.",1
5,Super soft. Loved it!,1
1,Didn‚Äôt even last through the summer before a strap broke. Should‚Äôve just paid extra and gone with Keens. Durability matters!,0
5,Hugs your body well but is loose around the waist.,1
5,all is good,1
1,"My girlfriend likes the gown, but it didn't include the peignoir. I contacted the seller but haven't gotten a reply.<br />I must say, I'm a little more than disappointed.",0
1,This is in no way a dress. It‚Äôs more like a slip that you can wear under a dress. Thin fabric.  I will not recommend this unless you are looking to wear it to bed.,0
5,I bought for a coworkers daughter who play baseball. SHE LOVED IT!,1
1,They don't seem authentic,0
2,Broke fast,0
5,Very nice hat and fits great,1
3,"The fishnet layer is quality and sewn in better than I expected. The cuts in the fabric over that are very raw. My complaint is the cut and shape of the pants. They fit awkwardly, like there is not enough fabric to cover the bum area and way too much in front as they pull up higher than the belly button area. I had to double check they weren't on backwards. First time wearing them out they became stretched and baggy in some areas and I had to keep pulling them up in the back. This was not a sizing issue, this was a cut and quality issue.",0
5,Odered a 9.5 shoe and was shipped a size 43 (European sizing) shoe.  The fit was excellent.  Have worn several times and am hoping they will have good longevity.,1
5,"I really, really like this bracelet. Nice, soft leather, beautiful sturdy anchor. I work offshore and gather plenty of compliments both from woman and man.  I really like this one.",1
5,My husband was surprised at how comfortable these are. The arch support is really good! He can walk a lot longer in these Without having back pain or feeling the flat foot,1
3,I found the sizes running a little small with the slipper very tight across the top.  So I am still wearing my old pair,0
1,Cup size is way to big and it's not very comfortable,0
5,I got so many compliments I love this 2 piece set I normal wear a medium so that's what I went with it fits true to size it's a thick material not cheap looking I'm 5'5 165,1
1,Put together backwards so I can't even fit it onto my neck.,0
1,Save you money returned,0
4,OK,1
1,"I was hoping they would feel like a really soft velvet but they were pretty stiff. I suppose I could have just dealt with it if the color was right but unfortunately it wasn't. I wanted a vibrant mint/aqua type color but it was more of a dull green, not bright or cute at all.",0
3,"These looked better on the picture. They were packaged nicely, but were dull and faded.",0
5,Perfect ü•∞,1
2,Poor quality,0
4,"I live in Arizona so when I go out my backyard to do a little yard work,  gardening and work on my pool this works very well it's bigger than a hat it covers my faceand, my neck, my shoulders and my chest the only issue I have with it is the plastic little things that hold the elastic around your forehead tend to get really stiff they itch sometimes they can poke your head a little bit other than that this thing is pretty awesome. I  actually ended up covering mine with Band-Aids and it doesn't bother me so much anymore and it worked out pretty good. My kids were embarrassed of me to be wearing this and really asked me not to go in the front yard however I've been caught wearing it. A couple of my neighbors have asked me where I got it from and have even said they want to buy it because it really does cover a lot and you don't have to worry about it falling off your head.",1
3,The bindings on the edge of the neck and armholes was poorly sewn. Also this item was larger than a normal medium.<br />I had to hem the pants by about 2 1/2‚Äù.,0
1,I bought several of these for my grandmother this is the only one that was way to big and had a hole.,0
5,I loved them,1
5,Yeeeeeeeeah I‚Äôm so glad that I purchase it. It‚Äôs the cutest xmas swearshirt I‚Äôve ever worn. I got so many compliments. I like the little lights on the shirt. It‚Äôs so much fun to wear it during Xmas season.,1
5,Wow...super comfy. May need another pair.,1
5,"Love theseeeeeeee! üíó Buy, BUY, BUY!!",1
3,Very soft and light weight.. Fit was a bit small.,0
5,Gave as a gift,1
3,They look like the picture but they are so uncomfortable,0
5,"I am in love!  This is a bit short but it just adds to the sexiness!  I bought the XL - I am 5' 6"" and am a 40DD - the fit is perfect!",1
1,The graphic was not as expected.  No rhinestones.  Very disappointing üòû.,0
3,"Although I took the time and care to measure my glasses (lens and frame), the product I received did not fit properly when clipped to the frame of my glasses.  It dropped below the frame. Therefore I returned it. Other than a poor fit, the sunglasses performed as stated.",0
1,The gray is WAY more purple than the pictures show.,0
2,These are the most uncomfortable workout pants I have ever worn. I purchased my normal size and the waist constantly rolls down. They are not squat proof either. Very disappointed!,0
4,"Great earrings, can be difficult to put on with the screw on backs.",1
4,"I am 5‚Äô4/5‚Äô5, size 6 jeans, 37-28-40. I am wearing size L. Normally a small in tops.<br /><br />The pants are long and the inseam is long, sitting about 2.5 inches above my belly button.<br /><br />The top is not fitted on me at all and I probably could have worn a small or medium as I have a smaller rib cage(30in). Waistband does not squeeze me but fits well. This is not a trouble area for me though it may be tighter on others<br /><br />Pants are wider leg and not slim throughout. Looks good for loungewear, but not a style I would wear out.<br /><br />Color is beautiful and true to photo. Not see through. Fabric is warm and thick, or as my boyfriend lovely commented, ‚Äúso now you‚Äôre wearing a rug‚Äù<br /><br />It‚Äôs plush and feels like those fuzzy socks. Highly recommend the material.<br /><br />Size down if you‚Äôre built like me with smaller measurements. Otherwise, I agree that it may run smaller than expected as others stated.",1
5,"I have plantar fasciitis and I'm a teacher so I'm on my feet a lot! I bought these last summer and I'm back for a 2nd pair! They are the only flip flop I can comfortably wear more than an hour or two without my heel aching for hours/days afterward. They are comfortable all over my foot, but they give great support to my heel!",1
2,Let me start off by saying I LOVE this shirt.. That why I was so disappointed about how uneven the hemline is. Seriously? I'm so upset because I really love the design of the shirt but the execution is terrible.,0
1,"As far as the color, fit, feel... This product was what I expected. However, the visibility of ones underwear is very clear and obvious and is NOT as advertised.<br />Unless you want to wear these around the house, I do NOT suggest getting them for public workout usage.",0
1,Not even worth 1 Star. A complete waste of money. The earrings will not ‚Äòopen‚Äô. Requested instructions from mfg. and was told to grip and pull. DID NOT OPEN. I pulled so long that the ‚Äústones‚Äù fell out. I DO NOT  RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.,0
1,"They looked so cute on but the first time I wore them, one of the jewels fell off within the first 20 minutes. They are just stuck on with some sticky substance that doesn‚Äôt work. Very sad, I thought they would work",0
5,These are so dang cute! I put them in my grandson's Easter basket. He isn't crawling yet but I can't wait for him to try them. The apple knee pad is so cushy soft so I'm sure will give him comfort in his house of all hardwood floors. My daughter loves them! I'm thankful to have the opportunity to receive them at a reduced price to test as a consumer. The price is right and they make a fantastic shower gift. I haven't seen them in stores.,1
2,"I really like the design. The problem is I think that it runs a bit small. ALso, the bottoms are SEE THROUGHOUT. I wouldn't wear this to the beach. I&#34;m going to make use of it by using in the sauna at my gym. SO, all in all I wouldn't recommend this for the beach/pool. ( what most people use bathing suits for.",0
2,rock keeps falling off.,0
5,It was what I was looking for,1
1,Bad quality and not the same description in the app...,0
3,Runs narrow...did not come with box or the extra set of grey laces...not the same quality as the older SB DUNKS,0
5,"Very stylish,  works well on those sunny days. I don't have to change glasses to read,perfect.",1
3,Too heavy and sits way to far off the ear. Not what i was expecting.,0
5,"Best belt I have ever owned. My old bet broke but I liked the strap still, with this buckle you can use any strap with it. It's simply amazing",1
5,More beautiful when you get this piece.,1
4,Short on length,1
5,"I was worried this jacket wouldn't fit. I'm 5'9 190 with most my weight up top, 36DDD and long arms. I got a 2X and thought if it doesn't fit it's only $15 and I can give it away, but it fits perfect! Long sleeves and I can even zipper with a sweatshirt on.",1
5,Love it. Feel safer traveling alone now.,1
5,"I am really impressed with this stainless steel eyeglass chain. It's beautiful, very well made, & since it's stainless steel, probably long-lasting. I couldn't be happier with this purchase",1
1,"I ordered this in black, size Large which fit great on my 5'10, medium build frame. However, I'm returning it because it was super see-through. Too see-through for my taste. The dress would be great if I were using it strictly as a bathing suit cover, but I'm hoping to wear it out -- family gatherings, BBQ's, weekend trips, etc, and I'm not sure I need the world knowing what my under garments look like. I also wasn't a fan of the pockets, which protrude out at the hips, like others have mentioned, and even more so then the picture. I wanted to like this, but it's not for me.",0
5,Livebut,1
5,"Wore these pants today and they were a hit!! Nice fit, very comfortable,great color",1
1,"Is supposed to be 3 caps, but unfortunately 2 was delivered. That's was look rip-off to me",0
4,"The picture was a little misleading in terms of the straps. I thought it would be 2 straps I tie together, but it is one long loop. The material is thin but not see-through. There is a bit of side boob but I'm big chested so I kind of expected that. The shirt is cute.",1
5,"I love it! It is cute and a good quality swimsuit. My 9months old daughter is 28.5 inches and 18.5 lb, and it fits just right on her.",1
4,"The size runs small! I bought the usual size and it was small I went back for one size more and it was perfect, I have washed this piece and kept the size and colors as it is seen in the picture!<br />I recommend this product!",1
1,"The arms where tight, the dress was short and had a weird cut in the cest area, and flared below the waist.",0
4,"The wallet is a unique idea, with promise, it is very difficult to remove credit cards and is rather time consuming it crowed check out lines. More work and this could be a great wallet.",1
5,Very nice!,1
3,Very cute but smaller for 6 year olds,0
5,Gorgeous and light but not cheap quality,1
1,I purchased the polarized black ones and I can‚Äôt see through them. They make everything look like oil spill. My original ones are polarized and nothing like these.,0
3,"I like the look and variety, but this product did not last long at all.",0
1,It was a very rectangular shape and wouldn't fit any human wrist I've ever seen. I tried to reshape it more rounded and it snapped. Don't recommend.,0
5,My 11 yr old son loves this lunch bag!  It is a little larger than I expected which is nice.  The top does not zip all the way closed.  We use the bottom part for the ice pack and cold items.  If you need a lot of cold space this might not work well.  Holds a lot of snacks in the top part.  Good quality.,1
3,IF you buy this for yourself or someone you care about.....check the batteries weekly! Ours are only a few months old and other than testing have never been used. During a training this was pulled out to show effectiveness and the batteries were dead! Check em!,0
5,Works just great.üòÇüòÇüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Semper-Fi,1
2,Nice casual summer dress ‚Ä¶ but incorrectly sized. It was much much smaller. I am a size 8 and ordered a medium. An X-Large may have been a great fit.,0
5,Bought this for a friend and he wears it everyday,1
5,I love this shirt!  It‚Äôs the first cute shirt I bought since losing weight and I love it! I just hate we‚Äôre in quarantine and I can‚Äôt wear it anywhere! And I have a big chest and this comes down to a good point! If you‚Äôre too heavy you know how hard it is to find that coverage. I would wear to work if they allow you to show a little shoulder! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 195lbs. Around a size 14 with DD chest.,1
4,Love everything about it. Chain is useful and light,1
1,"The watch was difficult to set, but worked well for a few months. Then it stopped working.",0
5,Good,1
5,Fits well. Color is so nice! Really love this swimsuit,1
5,Like the earrings - are fancy.,1
5,"lovely piece to go with dressier or casual outfits. Unfortunately I wanted it to go with a particular taupe colored dress and this brown is too warm. But I knew that was a risk and will use this with other outfits, so overall very happy with purchase.",1
1,The size chart was not true to size when receiving. They are way to small and can‚Äôt wear hen.,0
4,"These are basic drugstore reading glasses, so don't expect fine optical quality glass lenses. Where they excel, is the flip up feature, a feature I've been searching for for some time. No more leashes, sliding glasses up on your forehead, or putting them off and on, off and on. I've been using them for about a month, and so far they have held up well. Theyvome with a wipe and a pouch, both microfiber. One downside is shipping time, as they come by muletrain directly from... guess where!",1
4,"This is a very pretty light weight scarf. The description says &#34;silk&#34; which it is not but it also says &#34;voile&#34; which is normally cotton, linen, or polyester (think sheer curtain panels) so I feel it is a little misleading. That being said its still a really nice scarf. It's perfect for year round wear and looks great. The colors are delicate and feminine.",1
5,cute! but the buttons aren't fixed you may fix button.,1
1,Poor quality,0
2,"I expected a sweater, but it was a lot thinner. It fit well when I ordered a size up, but it was short (to be fair, I'm 5'9&#34; & have a D-cup), and I was overall unimpressed.",0
1,"It's been a while since I purchased this shirt because I've attempted to soften it ever since it arrived. It's VERY stiff and could probably stand on it's own. I've tried multiple things from soaking it in softener, or conditioner or even salt water, to no avail. I can't return it because it's well outside the window. Suffice to say it's more of a mannequin torso than a shirt.",0
5,"A very flattering sweater (I'm curvy), and I wanted something that let my tattoos peak out.  This fits better than I though it would, is warm, and so very soft!  Very good buy for the price.",1
4,Size runs very small. If you are a large the large barely fits. Quality is excellent!!,1
3,"So I ordered the 2x-3x....I'm not a 2x/3x, I ordered way up in size out of fear they'd be tight. Glad I did because they run small. I could get them on just fine, fit nicely. They are very very soft and very very very see through. I got the darker color and it's not that flattering to me. I don't mind that they are high waisted. I can deal with that. The only way I'd wear this out of my house is if I had a long tunic on or a shirt dress. So just be aware to size way up and don't bend over lol<br /><br />***I received this product free in exchange for honest review",0
5,"Really impressed with quality and fit, will buy again!",1
1,The earings are really cute BUT I pretty much had to rebuild both right out of the package. All glued parts were loose or had fallen off completely. One of the red beads for the nose was missing.,0
1,bad quality..... I order a medium and it was 3 sizes bigger,0
2,"Lowered my review because there were about 15 defective masks in the batch. Some had no ear hoops, many had no metal band for the nose‚Ä¶ rendering the masks useless.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller directly, hoping they would make it right by sending me some replacements, but they ignored my message.",0
5,"Excellent quality! The fabric, the stitches, everything!",1
5,I saw someone else who had the exact same muzzle so I had to order it. It's so soft and breathable. I did have to make a few modifications buy cutting some pieces off of the muzzle so it would sit on my face properly.,1
5,comfiest flip flop ever,1
5,Love this necklace. I bought two... one for my daughter and one for her good friend.,1
5,its perfect and really soft,1
3,This piece is beautiful in design. But it is not as substantial as I thought. It is rather flimsy and will bend easily.,0
5,"Purchased these shoes for my son's wedding, wasn't expecting to be able to wear them the entire evening, got tons of compliments..  Love them!!!!",1
1,Super blurry image on front,0
2,"These run extremely small. Even though I followed the size chart, I would say these are 2 sizes too small.",0
5,"If you are having shoulder surgery, you want at least one of these. I got one and ordered a 2nd, you won‚Äôt regret it.",1
5,"I have a special pair of most comfortable sweatpants from my college.  But I also have fumbling fingers and a pot belly, so it was hard to tie the drawstring at a comfortable tightness that worked.  The Bulliant belt I bought worked so perfectly on my dress pants (I'm a lawyer) that I ordered two more.  I had the tailor put belt loops on my sweatpants, and one Bulliant belt now works perfectly on the sweatpants -- so comfortable for the weekend!  The other two pants handle my weekday work pants.  Obviously I recommend this belt unconditionally.",1
5,Comfortable and fit perfect.,1
5,They fit right to size (11) and have made a tremendous difference in my squat stability and form!,1
2,"You get what you pay for... falls off constantly. Even if the tabs do click into place, they unclip and the band falls off. Almost lost my watch out of the car window because of it. Spend a couple bucks more and get a better quality band...",0
5,It‚Äôs very attractive on.,1
3,"A little small in the bust, so you need to wear a cami underneath",0
1,Did not really fit. I gave them away. Product not what it said it was.,0
1,Very thin and cheap material. Awful ugly wooden buttons.,0
3,"It‚Äôs ok. A bit itchy, the design is low on the shirt, so it makes your bust and stomach look like it has a face haha.. but I will keep it. Cute enough for the price!!",0
5,Just what I needed,1
5,This is such an adorable outfit.  My niece is 1 1/2 years old - and it fit her perfect.  I may get another for her sister !!,1
2,The pendant itself is beautiful!<br />I was expecting a simple chain like the one that was shown but it has a weird twisted wire thing going on connecting it and is stamped 18KGP...? Makes me wonder if any of it is &#34;Sterling Silver&#34;. Guess I'll find out after I give it as a gift for Mother's Day,0
4,"Not a bright white, almost a cream-ish color, but the style and fabric are great.",1
5,nice bands to keep the hair out of your face,1
5,Perfect,1
1,"Super disappointed. The dress that I received is not the one in the picture. Mine is long in the back and short in the front. It does not cross at the bottom in the front, it is straight across. It's odd for me being 5'4"". I definitely would not recommend.",0
2,"I like that I can fit my lunch, laptop, water bottle, pens/pencils, wallet and find everything without rummaging.  Small caveats, the shoulder straps are not long and I have to store my laptop so that it sticks out, but to me these are not deal breakers.  The bag material is very good quality.  However, all the clasps keep breaking off while carrying and then plus snagging my sweaters.  I have had 3 ruined shirts that have snags from the clasps.  I like the product wish the clasps were better quality so they don't come undone when carrying and snagging my shirts.",0
1,Not worth 34 bucks . I used it for a rag to clean my car ‚Ä¶,0
3,Was as expected but it came with a huge stain so I will be returning. I am not even going to try it on.,0
3,I really love this necklace I wear it everyday. Sadly it turns my neck green and the gold has come off and its starting to not look nice.,0
3,It‚Äôs a little big I should have gonn down a size,0
3,"The jewel isn't even red more of an orange-ish hue. I was disappointed, Because I had bought the cheap earrings that I thought had matched.",0
3,"It‚Äôs nice not all that,but it is what you expect it‚Äôs cute and somewhat comfortable.After a few washes the alien starts to fade.",0
5,"I bought this lizard watch strap because I have a watch with an orange seconds hand. It accents the watch as very nicely. The strap is easily attached and removed thanks to the spring bar design. If you want something to brighten up a watch, this is a good choice.",1
5,good entertainment formlittle kids,1
3,"I've washed these capris once, maybe twice and they're already pilling between the thighs and along the stitching. Disappointed with that, and I expected better quality. I do like the hidden pocket in the waistband. Also, these fit a bit snug.",0
5,Offer lots of support,1
5,"I never thought that I'd ever purchase disposable raincoats, but it's great to leave this in the car as sometimes rain comes unexpectedly. I don't always have an umbrella in the car, sometimes I do, sometimes people take them. Sometimes I have a lot of people in the car and only one little umbrella. It's good to know that I have these in the car for those &#34;Just in case&#34; moments. In addition to that, sometimes you simply can't hold an umbrella due to what your'e doing, whether you're changing a flat tire, or working on your car, and a rain coat keeps your covered. Each pack comes with 5 and since it's super affordable, I can definitely feel at ease knowing that I would never have to be caught out in the rain.",1
5,This sweater is incredible soft and so comfortable! I wore it like four times in the first two weeks of having it. I got a size small and it fit really well (a little loose around the torso as it should be but also not too tight around the wrist and waist). I really love the design of her sweater. It‚Äôs especially flattering with jeans!,1
3,Doesn't really provide any significant relief for carpal tunnel pain,0
3,"The color, fabric, and overall quality was pretty decent. The style itself was just not me.",0
5,"These are so pretty.  Bought them to wear to a wedding, and have ended up wearing them many more times as well.  Not too heavy either.",1
5,Playing ball in socks like these makes the game a little more fun. Legit Nike.,1
5,Worked great for a wedding,1
2,Colors not as pictured.,0
4,"The fabric quality is great. Not too thick or thin. 65% cotton, 35% polyester gives is a very good amount of stretch, but with a 100% cotton look. The design is vinyl and has no imperfections. The neck is made from the same material - not ribbed. The only negative I have is that it runs just a tiny bit on the small size. If you‚Äôre normally a large, get the XL & you‚Äôll be fine. I wear 2XL & this shows my back fat rolls. It‚Äôs slightly more ‚Äúform fitting‚Äù than a boxy t-shirt. The sleeves can be rolled 2-3 times, but they are short enough to leave unrolled.<br /><br />I would definitely order again.",1
5,thanks,1
1,These are not regular size snoods as shown in pictures. I have short hair and it all wont fit under it. Some are even smaller and barely stretch and actually hurt when I tried them on. Most of them also have loose strings and frays. My pictures show average snood next to one of these.,0
5,This watch shocked me i had lost it for almost a year then found it in a very hard to reach place under my car seat one day. It still had nearly identical time to my smart phone which obviously is always exact. For the price of this watch i didnt expect something that could keep time so well.,1
5,Cute and just as described,1
5,My love loved it,1
5,I haven‚Äôt worn them anywhere yet (still cold and rainy out) but they fit great and feel comfortable. I was worried after reading some reviews from other sites but so far i am happy with my purchase.,1
4,"Great dress, light weight, pretty fabric and the right price! Material is almost sheer but okay. I am 5'10&#34; and not just long legs, long waisted too. Hard to find a dress that is comfortable, but this is. Will probably buy another one.",1
1,"These are super wide at the top and with the way they velcro close, there is no way to make them tighter. They lasted less than 30 seconds on my daughter. Wasted money",0
2,"Fit was good. But loose. Ordered a medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 145. Small would‚Äôve been ok, I think. BUT... these things attract lint and fuzzies like crazy. I ordered black and every little thing ended up on these pants. The fabric is awful. Will be returning. Bummed because I like the fit :(.",0
3,the suit runs real small. i wish i knew that before purchasing. couldnt wear it and im an extra small and it was too small,0
1,"This is not denim. This is a thin cotton polyester shirt. As another reviewer said, hold it up to a light and you can see light shining through it. True denim cannot show light shining through it. The description also says 10% spandex. Spandex means it will stretch. There is no spandex in this shirt. Absolutely none.<br /><br />Total disappointment.<br /><br />Inaccurate and deceptive.",0
1,Ordered next size up from my usual and could not even get it on.  Very disappointed.,0
5,The colors are vibrant just like in the picture.  The bag is spacious and looks durable.<br />Anyone who loves dragonflies is sure to love this bag.,1
1,Horrible material,0
5,Don't hesitate to purchase This bracelet...<br />I have  many bracelets from  Nazareth Store<br />and have been more than pleased each time!!,1
5,I loved this shirt and wish it would have looked better on me (not the shirt's fault)!  Fabric is super soft and stretchy.  Nice length for longer torsos.  Super cute overall.,1
3,My son loves this necklace but the charm keeps coming off.,0
1,"I purchased this particular brand because liked another style I had ordered.  I had ordered a size up on the other style and found it a bit over-sized, so I ordered my regular size on this product.  It fits, but seems to run smaller for size.<br />The fabric is thin, clingy and the cut of the hem is downright weird making me wonder if I received a factory second. The gown hem is designed to curve up on the sides, but the back side of the gown I received is angled on the back left side to the point it hangs several inches shorter than the corresponding front panel.  Also, the trim around the neck does not lay flat.<br /><br />I will not return the product because I have washed and worn it.  On the bright side, it is comfortable.",0
3,The material and leg size is great. But the waist is way too small. If I wore them around my rib cage I could do it but c'mon now.  Very disappointed.,0
5,Just as expected and perfect for my needs,1
3,much more comfortable than normal compression socks but that is bc they are not compressing as much,0
3,Nice shirt....but returned because it was too big,0
5,Beautiful work. Well-lined. Nice detail.,1
1,Love it...but it wasn't what I order,0
5,The dress is cotton material. I am a 12-14 and ordered 2XL. The fit was fine. Size up if you don't like a snug fit. Will be great for the beach! I am 5 ft. 1/2 in. and the dress just comes to my knees.,1
5,"Pack of three was a great investment. I work with kids, and the hats were a big hit with the young elementary school crowd.<br />Then, I brought the hats to Thanksgiving dinner with family (very different demographics and ages), and they were ridiculed. But it was FUN!",1
1,The material is cheap and the the measurements are wrong. Way to short for a dress.,0
3,They allow more air through than most. I just hate masks.,0
5,"I really like them. Pilling occurs however, still awesome.",1
1,Fell apart in a hour.,0
1,"Ordered this for my mother, ordered a XLG and it could fit a 5 year old. It is 100%lined with a white fuzzy fabric, like fake fur, that you can see through the dark brown sweater so it appears that the sweater is covered in lint. Opened it and repackaged it immediately for a refund. I just dont see how anyone would keep this.",0
5,"My 2 year old loves this backpack! First thing she said was ""hop!"" Because of the rabbit was too cute not to notice! Once my child is outside she runs away from me so this is great to have while going for walks.",1
5,Ready for our party. Great suit!,1
1,No me agrado tanto pagar x algo q ven√≠a da√±ado,0
5,"Good deal ,nice light weight, and does the job.",1
2,"It‚Äôs super cute, unfortunately when you place the credit cards in the slots they slide all the way to the bottom of the wallet. The pockets they have  for credit cards, your license and that sort of thing  aren‚Äôt staggered so they‚Äôre useless.",0
2,Product fits fine but is very uncomfortable. There‚Äôs part of the shoe that runs hard against my ankle bone making it impossible to wear for any length of time. Better off spending more money for a quality shoe.,0
5,I wear it everyday and I Love it! Great value for the money! I already bought 2 more for gifts.,1
2,"Should include a warning that, unless you're built like Beth Dutton, shirts run at least 2 sizes too small",0
3,"The color is beautiful! I love how it looks on my skin tone. The chest part is a little big but then the tummy part is tight. I wear a 36dd for reference. Also, the back is weird. The panel should have a hook to make it stay up and then have the tie criss cross. I know i missed a hook for the tie but it was just weird. I didn't think it worked well and it should have just been a zipper or buttons or something. The bottom is a perfect length for heels. I am 5'0 and i know it will be a little long but i expected that. Overall, this dress has potential. I'll make it work but just wish the size was fluid throughout and not tight around the hips/tummy and not so big on top.",0
5,"My wife loves these, especially in winter, she now expects them under the tree at Christmas.  U have to try them to believe how soft they are. Thin or thicker all are great and you will enjoy wearing them. She wears at work, at a child development center and much more comfortable then regular sox. Her kids love the colors and throw in washer and dryer, and they stay soft.",1
3,bit too see-through but I can add a camisole under and it's fine.,0
1,The picture makes it look like the torso is long enough but it is actually very short and but very wide. It is no proportioned well at all.  Would fit if I was 4ft tall an 4ft wide. Very disappointing.,0
5,I‚Äôm so happy it came well packaged and fast and it‚Äôs not cheap in quality at all.,1
5,Es muy c√≥modo y suave,1
3,Good cotton,0
1,"Not what I expected.  They are clunky and don't sit on my ear right, making it look awkward (which it is).",0
5,Runs a little big compared to other 2t shirts but it washes nicely and my son loves Chuggington,1
4,"Runs small but fits great get a bigger size. Pretty color, comfy and flattering",1
1,not 14kt,0
3,Love the color just wish it fit a little better,0
5,Use these for my work keys and it works great!,1
1,"I was excited when I found these wide pants which I was looking for.  But the material is cheepy side, I can‚Äôt wear them for my office so unfortunately I returned them..",0
1,Should be illegal.  Its dangerous.,0
4,"I wish there were larger size offerings, as I'm typically a 2X, BUT as other reviewers say, it's a bit oversized, so the XL works fine for me. Other than that, I LOVE this dress. It's beautiful and pretty versatile. It's very flattering and is great to wear for almost anything, even a casual outdoor wedding! I will most likely be purchasing another color.",1
3,"These designs are sweet. My daughter looks adorable in them, but I'm not impressed with the quality. They run a little large, and material is a little flimsy and they dont hold their shape very well.",0
1,I didn‚Äôt like the fit. It just didn‚Äôt look right and the material is too thin. But what did I expect for such a cheap price,0
1,ugh-ugliest buttons ruin these potentially ok oddly shaped<br />too small for size chart too,0
5,These are really cute and fit great.,1
1,"Runs a little small, uncomfortable fit.",0
1,What a bad joke!  They‚Äôre so small that they won‚Äôt be wearable except an actual Barbie Doll!  They went into the trash as the rip-off they are!,0
1,Still waiting on rest of delivery? Emailed them??? Ok thin I double them east wear,0
5,Enough tape for 2-4 hats! Perfect as expected. Great product!,1
5,"Very cute and flattering, I wish it had push up in the cups though",1
3,"I'm regularly a Size M but this one is too tight maybe due to the &#34;crop top-ish&#34; style, I wear it anyway",0
1,This thing is way overpriced and I forgot to return it. It‚Äôs not super sturdy and all the ‚Äútools‚Äù it shows that it was supposed to come with did not come with it. Looks like I got me an overpriced bowl for popcorn.,0
5,Perfect!,1
5,Love my necklace.,1
3,I liked everything about this dress but it felt large for the small size I ordered.  Part may be due to the cut so no fault of the dress on it's own merit.  Just know it will be very loose fitting,0
4,"This top does fit but only because I ordered the largest size (XXXL). I am a size 12/14 on top and the 3X fit great, hiding the mommy tummy perfectly. Love the color. The fabric is very thick. Tends to be hot. Won't be a good summer shirt as I was hoping for, but it will be cute for fall/winter.",1

5,"With only 1 review, I was nervous to order from this company but so glad I did. I ordered, sent my measurements to them via Amazon mail, and received a reply within 24 hours that they could custom make my size. It came in a bit sooner than expected, and it is gorgeous! Fits perfectly to my figure; perfect length; they even made the built-in bra to my DDD size. The dress fits like it was made for me - 'cause it was. I normally wear a 14 but ordered a 16 so it could be customized. I did mess up and forget to order a zipper back so it came in as a lace up. My hubby can help when it comes time to wear it so not a big deal. I am more than thrilled with my purchase. As you can see in the second picture, some of the lace on the sleeves looks frayed where it was cut, but that should be simple to fix. Highly recommend this company and this dress!!!",1
5,I love them üòç,1
1,"***UPDATE***  After using this bag for several months,  the ring holding the strap is permanently broken,  and the zipper still doesn't close properly.  Horrible bag for the money.<br /><br />This is a really cute bag,  I get a lot of compliments on it,  but my only beef is that the main zipper is really hard to close,  even unobstructed.  It's annoying.  Hoping after more use it will soften and just get better,  but I've been using it for a couple of weeks now.",0
2,"The blue and white paisley pattern is pretty, but I question the decision to put brown (blond wood colored) buttons on the front when a white to match the pattern would have been more  appropriate and stand out less. I'd swap them out if I intended to wear the shirt but the waist hits me too high to be at my waist but too low to be an empire . I'm not a long waisted person and don't usually have this trouble with clothes. It's not flattering at all, and has seams in odd places so it's not comfortable, in spite of softness of the fabric.",0
5,"The replacement window sets for my Rolf wallet are perfect - just what I was looking for.  The price was great, the shipping was fast, and purchasing was an easy transaction.  I will order again when I need new replacements.",1
1,Mala calidad del material de quebr√≥ en el primer uso.,0
3,"Great concept, but the fleece material this is made of feels more like felt. I don't anticipate it will last long after washing.",0
5,"I bought it for my cousin, and she loved it. Although I was unsure as to whether or not the chain was strong, it was large enough to where she did not have to unclasp it. If you want a gift for a cat lover or just a cute accessory, this is the necklace to buy",1
5,This is a beautiful pendent! I love it and have gotten lots of compliments!,1
5,Fits perfect. Great material,1
3,"I ordered the Eco Black, the item arrived really quickly and it's okay  but it is not even close to being black, it's a charcoal grey with almost white flecks throughout. It's soft (think thin soft flannel PJ's), and I don't think of it as oversized at all; it's a decent size and I'm a scarf lover, quality is okay so I'll keep it but definitely not what I thought I was getting. I don't think I'll order anymore of their  products and I had planned to purchase a couple more scarves had I really liked this one. In fairness to the company, the color in the pic is pretty accurate, they should just say it's charcoal grey and not black.",0
5,Great product! I've purchased three copper necklaces and one copper bracelet so far from I Love Copper and these are great quality for the money. I'm super picky about everything I buy and I have nothing negative to say about this product. The only request I would have to make is that they offered 2 day prime delivery.,1
4,Good coat for the price. Nothing of high quality fabric. But nicely made and very cute on. Just needed it for a quick trip to Ohio and for the price it was good enough.,1
2,too small,0
5,I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 107 lbs with an athletic/slim frame. These leggings fit me great in a small. I am usually an extra small and was a little weary these wouldn‚Äôt fit. If you are in between sizes you may want to size up. These are very high waisted (see photo) and offer moderate tummy control. The contouring is very flattering. Material is a little thicker than my other basic workout leggings but still comfortable. These are squat proof as long as you don‚Äôt wear brightly colored or printed underwear. I plan on ordering in more colors. My dog also thinks these leggings are pretty good.,1
4,gift for mom's birthday in Oct.,1
1,"Cheap cheap cheap!  I can‚Äôt believe this designer would put her name on this dress.  Material is like paper, very thin, and clung to my skin due to static from the cheap material.  Retuning!!",0
5,I've ordered this dress in 2 colors the black and mauve . Love ‚ù§Ô∏è! Great for weddings I'm 5'7 and 165. Great fit !,1
3,"Love the print, lightweight, fits as expected.<br />The flare is rather big/high/wide on the shoulder, unsure yet how it will hold up in washing as has flexible boning in the flare that helps it keep the lift structure of the flare.",0
5,"Great looking, nice shape - at that price no issues.",1
5,"Form fitting and very flattering. I am not ashamed to say that I pretty much live in these shirts. I bought this 3 pack and then bought another 3. I gave one to my sister and she loved the shirt, as well. I will note that the solid colored shirts show all of your sweat, which is really disappointing. I returned those shirts. However, the pattered/static print looking shirts are perfect and hide sweat very well. I just wish the colors didn't repeat in the trio purchase options.<br /><br />These shirts are very breathable and I can attest that they are great for weight lifting, squats, floor exercises/yoga, running and even as lounge wear. I am an athletic 5'3&#34;, 130lbs and purchased size S. The long sleeve shirts look and feel great + they stay in place and I have no issues with them riding up at all.",1
2,The skirt is fine its a little thin but fine for the beach. The top is basically unwearable. It has bungee straps and they‚Äôre so tight that the shirt just sits at your armpits. I do not recommend purchasing.,0
1,The stones fell out and the beautiful tugs on anything! That‚Äôs how I noticed the stones were missing!,0
4,"I have moderate arthritis in boh of my hands and while they don't hurt all the time, there are days when it's painful and I can't find a comfortable position. Even holding and operating my I-pad is painful ( and a constant as I can't be without it :) ) This glove is nice because I can use it on either hand depending on which is hurting at the time. I also like the fact that it covers most of my hand while still allowing me pretty good flexibility. I've had other gloves that provided more compression, but they didn't cover the second joint on my fingers where I get some of my pain. I also appreciate that this glove has sturdy seams at the end of each finger. No more strings hanging done and irritating me. I don't know anything about the properties in copper and whether they contribute to this gloves effectiveness, but I do know that after wearing it for about a half hour last night, my hand was much less stiff and achy.<br />I think this glove may be a bit bulky and I wish that it came in different sizes so I could get a more snug fit, but there is a Velcro strap that can tighten it around the wrist. I would recommend this product to anyone I know who also suffers from mild arthritis in their hands.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1
1,Cheap,0
2,"They feel so cheap and fragil; I got a feeling that they are not original, even the case was bad so I returned them not worth buying.",0
3,The straw quality is cheap less good compared to cat an jack brand at target. The bow and ribbon came half unglued and already fallling apart . The purse is cute but overall would not buy again,0
2,"The top was a size too small and the fabric is not soft @ all. The length is short, which was OK b/c I wanted a shorter top to go over long skirts. The lace was pretty. The buttons are plain white flat buttons. I would not buy this top again.",0
1,The straps have broken from the metal clip. The pockets inside the bag are all shredded,0
4,Perfect size and feels great!,1
1,WOULD NOT BY EVER AGAIN!!!!!,0
5,Great fit for two year old.  Lightweight and durable but not ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù as some are. Covers well and is usually left dirty(paint) then used again...probably wouldn‚Äôt try cleaning it every time.,1
4,"This is a super comfortable, seems to be well made dress. I am 4'10, 36DD, size 12 (big butt) in pants, much smaller waist. I purchased the L based on the reviews and it fit pretty well. I was concerned the empire waist would hit in the middle of the chest but it hit right below my chest so that was nice and unexpected. The length was at my knees and I was expecting it to be longer but my body does take up some room. I loved the color, nice deep red. I am ordering the black too. It doesn't look sheer at all but I am planning on wearing them with black tights as the weather is getting cooler quickly here plus I am a teacher around teenagers, want to make sure everything stays covered.<br /><br />However, just a note. If you have a bit of belly fat and have a full figured chest, this dress will make you look pregnant. The way it falls from the chest, the flowiness make you look 5 to 6 months pregnant. I loved that since I am trying to get pregnant but it's going to be hard to wear this dress and have people think you're pregnant all the time. But like I said, I'm hoping to be pregnant this fall so I will wear this dress and order the black one to have for maternity wear.",1
5,I like them. Nice loose fit.,1
5,Great looking watch. My husband loves it. Works well and is comfortable to wear. He has gotten many compliments.,1
4,"Nice, quality jacket one would expect from Mt. Hardware. The baffles are sewn-through, and the loft approaches 1&#34;. Combined with clothing one would expect for light to moderate outdoor activity, this jacket would keep most people warm into the mid-teens and above. Elastic drawstring around the hem and elasticized wrists keep the chill at bay.",1
3,"Malita calidad , doy 3 porque no estaba tan caro",0
1,broke within the hour of wearing them. Badly made,0
1,This item does not fit on a pandora bracelet! The hole is to small. Disappointed,0
5,Cute,1
1,"Worn a size nine for a long time but it does not fit, I had to go up to a 10 that fits but this does not.  I would recommend that you go up a size.  Maybe it was a fluke and a one time thing for me but I would go up a size.",0
3,The seems are a little messy and the sequins don't flip well there,0
1,"This outfit is advertised as able to fit a teen and extra large will fit 36 inch waist.. that is a lie, this is a size small at best maybe for an 4 or 5 year old.. my 12 year old was disappointed and I'm upset because I ordered a Roblox one also that will arrive tomorrow. Even the bag inside the Amazon package was the size of a small freezer bag. That's how small and thin this product is.",0
1,This hat was very cheaply made and looked like a child's hat,0
5,I love this dress and its very comfortable! Great for anytime! Not to dressy but just enough! Will be ordering more! If your thinking about it...do it!,1
5,Love it!! I was very surprised with the quality of the fabric and fits perfectly!,1
5,"My granddaughter loves this hat with the chin strap that keeps it in place in the wind.<br />She recently took it along to Yosemite and it was very handy for the bright, sunny and windy days.<br />It is comfortable and gives great protection to keep the sun off her face.",1
5,Great product fast service,1
3,"so one of my earrings wouldn't latch closed when it arrived. I noticed that the post seemed ever so slightly bent so I tried to gently straighten it and after a few tries, it finally did click into place and latch.<br />The posts of these earrings are quite soft and bend easily. The earrings do not latch very securely either. That being said, they haven't come undone while I've been wearing them, which is probably because they are so small and light.<br />Other than the fear of losing one, I really love these earrings. They are so tiny and dainty that they could be passed off VERY easily as real diamonds. I am happy with them.<br /><br />11/24/20 EDIT:<br />Unfortunately I feel the need to come back and remove an additional star from these earrings. They seemed okay at first but they have becoming increasingly easier to lose as time goes by. I probably would have lost one by now, if not for the fact that I tend to reach up subconsciously to feel for them several times a day. Many times I've found one to be open and just dangling from my ear lobe and I have to close it again. Furthermore, I have had them fly right off my ear three times now in the last week or so. Once I was just closing the shed door after heading out to get a paintbrush. When I stepped out and spun around quickly to slide the door closed I saw something shiny go skittering across the concrete and realized it was my earring. Another time I was brushing my teeth and it fell out, right into the sink, and I almost lost it down the drain. Finally, just yesterday at the office I brushed my hair out of my face and behind my ear and an earring fell out, bounced off my chest and landed on my desk in front of me. You are earrings. You have one job. Stay in my ear... These can't seem to do that.<br /><br />Still, they are adorable... so I remain at 3 stars.",0
5,Goes perfectly with my faux multi strand pearl necklace.<br />I bought this in both colors and totally love them.<br />One post arrived bent but was easily straightened.,1

1,I purchased this dress (same picture) from another vendor but in a size too big. That dress was incredible so I searched again and accidentally purchased the dress advertised as the same pic from this vendor. The dress looked nothing like the picture or the other dress (which was accurately shown). The material was cheap. The vendor was difficult with and wouldn't accept the return. Now I'm stuck with a dress I can't wear that I still had to pay for.,0
3,very pretty but runs SUPER small. im a medium top size. ordered a medium. i couldnt even get it over my head. re-ordered in xtra large.,0
5,"I purchased this turtleneck sweater dress to wear with leggings this winter and am super happy with the quality. The stitching is done well and the material is very soft and knitted well. The fabric is in a cable knit pattern, lightweight and since mine had no tag, I am going to assume 100% polyester. Regardless of material, it is comfortable to wear and definitely is a slim-fit design. I purchased an XL and wear a size 12 and it hugs the curves. Add a cute belt or wear it alone - I have worn it both ways and had numerous compliments. The length is perfect as it falls just about mid-thigh on me and I am 5'8. I washed separately due to color and laid flat to dry so it didn't shrink. If it does, it would be too tight to wear.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this and the quality is there. I would feel good purchasing it as a gift for someone this holiday.",1
5,Look more expensive than they are,1
5,Love this shirt! Fits great and covers my leggings perfectly,1
1,Glasses are huge and look like an oversized pair of aviators glasses.,0
2,"I have possibly been spoiled by other Amazon purchases which seem to arrive almost as soon as I get submit the order. This took over 3 weeks to arrive and when it did it was broken. I can make it work, but this is not a product I would rate highly.",0

3,Pretty but a very flat sparkle.,0
5,This product has been great. Fits to right size but have not had them long. The review should be further out so customers can comment on the durability.,1

1,Not at all what was described....at least 2-3 sizes smaller than indicated.,0
1,Too big! I looked like I had on a mumu!,0
2,"way to small, arms are 1/2 the size they need to be, and the dress is way shorter than i expected, especially the slip part, it didn't cover what it needed to at all! can never wear it.",0
3,Only wanted the black one but had to buy all 12 in the packet. Smaller and tighter around the head than expected. Nice quality and durability. Very soft and nicely crafted. Just small for our use.,0
4,"I‚Äôm an 11 size in regular shoes but after reading a couple reviews, I decided to go with the XL and good thing I did. These do run small so go up a size if you tend to get these slippers",1

5,This is a beautiful scarf both in appearance and in wearing.. It is nice and long so can be wrapped around the neck several times if desired. The light gray color is very attractive.,1
2,Only two collars were sent. Missing the 3rd.,0
5,Great price. Functional! Unique to standout.,1
2,"These were extremely uncomfortable to wear as the &#34;round&#34; ends almost all had very rough edges that do not feel good in, on, or around your nose. Also, as some reviewers have stated, these were smaller than 18G.",0
3,I like the design and the fabric.  this dress runs small but I can wear it.  I am a average to shorter person and the dress top is almost too short.,0
1,Needed a basic digital waterproof watch for the gym. Read the reviews and like the price and tactical look of this...unfortunately it arrived with a dead battery. Contacted the shipper and they said to send back. They didn‚Äôt offer to send another one or could they detail how long the battery should last. I found another watch which has more features for a few dollars more which better suits my needs.,0
5,great quality and taste,1
2,The quality was so so.,0
5,Love this for my five months pregnancy belly.,1
5,"These boots are darling and functional -- and they were super cheap in price! I still can't believe it... seems too good to be true! Love the style and they work in the rain, mud, you name it. Great buy!! I should add, I've got size 7, super wide feet, so it's hard for me to find boots that I can fit my foot into without a zipper or laces... and I'm able to wear these with socks even... no problem! Size is perfect.",1
1,Material and sewing is low quality.,0
1,The size of the shirt was way off. Ordered at 3x was probably size small but was tagged 3x.,0
5,"Got these for my mom. Her feet swell and she may be one size one day and a bigger size tomorrow. Anyway, she is super picky bc ‚Äúnothing ever fits‚Äù and she said these are perfect. I know she can wear them on days she is swollen too.",1
3,Jacket fit good. Hat was very wrinkled and couldn't fix it. Gloves were long from the fingers but fixed them by cutting them.,0
3,"The blouse is adorable and I love the rise color. I actually ordered 2. One in my typical size and this one, 3 sizes up. I have my very small sister the first one, she is 3 or so sizes smaller than me. This one fits.",0

1,Would not buy again.  Threads loose everywhere,0
2,Cheap looking,0
4,"Wow!  This purse has way more space than I thought it would have.  It's super durable, and seems like it will last a long time.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars for me is because of the texture of the purse.  It feels very nylon-y.  I have some texture issues, and I thought I would have to return it.  It got better, but it still feels kind of scratchy and stiff to me.  I am willing to work around it because otherwise I really like it for the space and many compartments of the purse.<br /><br />I was looking to get a bigger purse because apparently as you get older, you need to carry around more stuff!!  This works great, and I still have plenty of space to fill as needed.  The zippers are not super smooth, but it is more like a learning curve, and I think they get better with time.",1
3,I am normally a 8.5 M and that is what I ordered. These were too big - loose in heel and loose on sides. Love the shoe...hope next size down works!,0
5,Great for my baby! Fits a bit big but better than too small.,1

5,Perfect!! a bit small but i have a small head so it works :D stretches beautiuflly,1
1,"I just bought this belt, I have a 32/33‚Äù waist so bought a 34‚Äù belt.  The first and only time I wore it, for a round of golf, it must have had 7‚Äù of excess belt at the start of my round and 10‚Äù of excess by the end of my round (I kept having to tighten it to keep my pants up).  Looks ridiculous having 10‚Äù of excess belt hanging out.  Not sure what I‚Äôll do with the dumb thing now.",0
2,This shirt was gigantic.,0
3,Product showed up on time however upon arrival I noticed one side appeared to have a sloppy and noticeable glue job. For the price paid I guess I was expecting it to look nice on both sides.,0
3,These feel cheaper than my Fort Knocks. They also arrived with crooked arms that I had to bend. The arms don't fold either. Still these are good looking and durable.,0
1,I brought two of these umbrellas for my kids but they are poorly made. It is difficult for the locking mechanism to catch by the handle to close and lock properly. Plus the metal frames were so sharp that I ended cutting myself trying to pull the umbrella close. Not appropriate for my kids and will definitely be returning.,0
1,"These &#34;pants&#34; are thinner than most leggings, and run small. I'm between sizes and ordered the larger, but they were too small. No one could mistake these for jeans. If you have any lumps and bumps, they will be amplified and clearly visible through these. They are soft and comfortable, but so are cotton leggings.",0
1,Cheap... Broke within first day of NORMAL use... waste of money... very disappointing!,0
1,"Waitied a week it appeared to be packaged ok for the shipping. I didn't wear the braclet when I first received it was waiting for a nice occasion to enjoy it. It does look nice it has a different tone to it. More like a deep 10k look you can't put it on next to 14k or 18k. Not a good look, The 1st time was on my wrist about 3 hours at the movie theater . On the 2nd time had it on at a ballgame alittle humidity for 5 hours when I went to take it off it was turning blackish & inner part of wrist was discolored. What a shame I liked it. About fully OD Green now.",0
2,Construction is a bit awkward. Tight. Would not buy again,0
1,"This vendors ""Vote mask"" has very soft fabric but does not sit well on your face and the letters don't display properly on the mask while wearing. Not able to breathe well with these due to soft flimsy fabric that goes inside your mouth and makes you feel like you're suffocating. Plus I doubt these keep the covid virus away if they touch your mouth.  Feels more claustrophobic than the disposable paper masks.",0
3,"i didn't expect much from these slippers.  i only needed them to match a costume/pajamas and fit me.  and i hate the little decorative pearl and chiffon trim thing - that's going away fast.  but i followed everyone's advice and sized WAY up and they just barely - barely - fit.  i'm a 9.5 in us women's sizes and ordered the 10-11, the slipper as marked of course says 7-8 on the sole, which should have been perfect anyway since depending on the brand i'm usually a uk7.5 thereabouts anyway, and 41/42, which is the euro size (and does not equate to the uk size at all, but the us10-11), and i'm a solid 40 in euro sizes, which makes the entire sizing concept on these slippers fascinating.  my suggestion is to find your corresponding UK shoe size on any international shoe size conversion chart and go by that size and ignore the rest.<br /><br />but these don't have so much of a fit issue in the length department for me.  they are VERY narrow - my feet hang off the sides of the soles, supported by nothing but plush material, which is an interesting feeling.  and the seam where the top of the slipper's foot joins the shaft of the bootie portion digs in nice and sharp at the ankle.  no idea why that's so narrow too, and yet it is.",0

5,soooooo worth it,1
1,"One of the glasses was broken when I got them, I want it replaced but can't seem to get it replaced",0
5,Beautiful dress! My little sister loves lemons and this dress was perfect! It fits true to size!,1
5,Fits perfect and is very comfortable!,1
1,"Even buying larger size this is still too small and tight yet the arms are long. They shouldn't bother selling to a market if you can't accurately match the sizes. The only reason l'm not returning is because there's someone in the house it fits, a normally size 4!!!",0
1,"Wore it once and it completely fell apart. Worst purchase ever, but you get what you pay.",0
1,"Honestly, in person it looks like it belongs in the 80's over a hot pink Victoria's Secret bikini. It was for my 60 year old mother... Needless to say, we sent it back and went with a classier option.",0
5,Good quality. My new favorite belt.,1
3,Small rings... only use with very thin scarfs.,0
5,I bought this hat for my husband for a Derby Party.  It worked great for him and everyone wanted to try it on.  :),1
4,"These rings are a watered-down version of the photos. The design is not as defined, they are not as thin and dainty as they look and the edges are unfinished (seams visible). That said, it‚Äôs what I needed (currently pregnant and swollen) and a pack of six was 11 dollars so I assumed I‚Äôd get what I paid for. Which in my case is not a bad thing.",1
5,Good quality and stays in place when a lot of other headbands slip up on the back of my head.,1
5,Wife loves it,1
1,Short size ran small! If you purchase order a size up.,0
5,Great value,1
5,So cute and well made. Can‚Äôt wait to see my little helpers (grandkids) wearing it while we cook for the holidays,1
1,Smells like gasoline!<br />very bad,0
5,I love the way they feel on my feet. I can walk in them all day and my feet feel great. When I do wear them I get a lot of compliments on how cute they are.,1
4,Would like more compression<br />Warm when wearing due to the material,1
4,Lounging,1
2,Very big and doesn‚Äôt stay up the top Is constantly falling down for the price it‚Äôs a waste,0
5,Cool robe,1
5,100% satisfied,1
5,These are by far some of the best reusable bags I've purchased. They are well built and feel like they are gonna last a long time. They fold up nicely and fit great into the the half net carry bag they come in. These are great. I'll get more soon that's for sure,1
5,They look even better in person than in the pictures! Great earrings,1
3,Pants are tall girl friendly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 with a 30‚Äù inseam and they touch the ground. The only issue is the jacket runs a little small. Overall it‚Äôs a good buy.,0
3,Bit too small than I expected,0
1,"Over 50% of the lights were not working. Several others were broken in the bag.  It look like a really fun toy, but it was very disappointing that most of the lights were non-functioning.",0
1,Pretty color but the material is now what it was made out to be and I ordered a 2x because I figured it would run small but it still came in as a size small in US sizes,0
5,"Got this for gym, as it is very small and simple. I didn't use any functions other than the clock<br />PROS:<br />- very small, yet easy to read<br />- very good price<br />- built in light<br />- easy to set<br />- very light<br />CONS:<br />- none so far",1
1,"Aggravated ears, but if you do not have sensitive ears would be great.",0
5,Very nice,1
4,it's a robe. the drawstrings feel a little flimsy but overall good quality.,1
1,"Very thin, tight and does not fit properlyVery poor quality material especially for $35.",0
4,"These are a bit bigger, wider, and sturdier than most sunglasses I may wear other than my Oakleys.  They would be great for all kinds of sports like cycling, hiking, and many others.  They are not heavy at all and seemlessly move with you without moving anywhere on your face.  They are very comfortable to me.<br />My only concern is they came right out of packaging a little crooked on my face.  It took a little playing with the frames and they seem ok now.<br />You can see from my one photo the view partly with and without the lens of the sunglasses.  They seem to be polarized as stated and come with a test for polarization for you to look at.  Also has a sturdy case and a microfiber cloth.<br />All in all a good sturdy pair of sunglasses with a sporty look that is comfortable and won't move on your face.",1
2,Disappointed about the material of this. It‚Äôs not sweatshirt material. Just didn‚Äôt like how it felt,0
1,"Ordered one size over,that turned out OK but width is so narrow I can only stand to where them for a half hour.",0
2,Beads are much larger than I thought,0
5,"Just got the masks. They are well made, fit great and feel very comfortable. Unless something funny happens when I wash them, they appear so far my favorites. Great price and delivery time (next day) too!",1
5,Item just as described and shipped quickly. I am happy that I went ahead and purchased the device. It actually charges faster than my original. I recommended this to friends.,1
5,"I‚Äôm a size 7 most times, but had to size up to 7 1/2. These fit perfect now. Very comfortable. I walked for about 3 hours doing some shopping and my feet felt well supported. Looks great with jeans",1
5,"I'm extremely hard to fit with leggings, especially when I'm using them to actually workout. And these are fabulous. I love the 2 side pockets and a pocket for my keys too! They are comfortable and are officially my go-to leggings.",1
5,Like the fit,1
3,This skirt is very strecthy and ran somewhat big. Nice material. Length was perfect for me. I ended up returning.,0
3,It was very nice,0
4,"Ok, I totally changed my mind.  At first, I didn't like that it didn't cover my butt but if you shift it back just a little it's ok.  I like the look a lot.  For the price, it's really great.  The material is pretty soft, not scratchy.",1
5,Great serviice and product,1
5,"I bought this dress for my wife and she really love it. She's Filipina, 5'1 and weight 102 lbs. And she's going to buy another color",1
5,Beautiful.,1
4,"Need to be glued, but work great.",1
5,Fit good,1
4,Good for everyday wear.  Nothing fancy.,1
1,Picture & product not the same.,0
5,My son loved this shirt and wears it a lot. Fit is perfect no shrinkage.,1
5,"I won the ugly Christmas sweater,  t-shirt contest!",1
5,Lovely Art Deco style,1
4,Glasses work great to locate ball after hitting. The lens helps read greens a lot better than my standard black tint sub glasses. Only issue is the nose grip has ridges in it which can be uncomfortable after a round on a hot day.,1
3,I loved the print but was a little disappointed in the fit and drape of this dress. Would not order again,0
5,I saw this & just had to order for my husband for our 50th anniversary. He really loved it..,1
1,Return,0
3,"Ordered 2 different brands for laboring and afterwards in hospital. This one was way too small, did not fit like XL...I wanted super baggy. Other brand was perfect",0
5,Granddaughter loves it,1
1,I had to return this coat!  The quality was poor.  The size was not at all true to size.  I was very dissatisfied and disappointed.,0
1,Shirt was TOO SMALL and I even ordered a size bigger. The print is blurry and looks poorly done like almost airsprayed on. Shipping took FOREVER. ALL AROUND BAD PURCHASE I SUGGEST LOOKING ELSEWHERE.,0
2,"Poorly constructed, it came apart.",0
5,"A genuine hand-wound pocket watch with a genuine movement you can observe! I can read it from either side, thanks for the button that pops open one cover. There are no batteries to run down or replace. I may decide to try using it on a chain or lanyard that goes around the neck. Its own chain is a single with a clip that can be hooked to a belt or belt loop or pocket edge.",1
5,"At the discounted price, i was worried as to what i would get. But rest Assured, these are 100% Authentic and legit! Looks awesome! :)",1
5,Bought them as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend and he loves them ! He said the quality is great,1
3,The bands are short so it must be complexity undone to get on and off and to put on charger.  A little more length would be nice,0
3,"While the item appears completely as described, this item ships from China.  Had I been aware that this product ships directly from China, so therefore not subject to US inspection, I never would have placed this order.  Jewelry comes in contact with the skin, I have no way to know if the materials used to manufacture this item is safe for human contact.  I threw it away.<br /><br />I should also mention that I placed this order on February 8, 2015 and it arrived on March 9, 2015, a full month later.",0
1,Sooooo cheap looking. And not returnable. Very disappointed. I've seen McDonald's happy meal toys that will last longer than these sunglasses,0
5,Always unsure of how soft shirts are but these were super soft. They wash very well and the images don‚Äôt fade and aren‚Äôt cheaply made at all. They are also longer which is a plus with a taller little one.,1
1,cheap! I returned!,0
3,They are warm and I've had other pairs in the past but for some reason these keep slipping off of my ears. Bummer.  Spend the money on a name brand and try them on in the store to save yourself the frustration.,0
1,Jacket did not fit.<br />Cannot give a fair review.,0
1,You get what you pay for.  Cheaply made.,0
3,The mask worked wonders but i still have a hole in mine,0
4,Definitely good quality and easy to put in for even my sensitive nose‚Ä¶ just too bulky to wear often.,1
5,"The Casio F91W-1 is the original. Like the Ray-Ban Wayfarer, the Clarks Desert Boot, or Levi's 501s, this watch started a trend and has been imitated ever since. I've owned all sorts of digital watches over the years, from the inexpensive to the unreasonably pricey (Suunto Core comes to mind, batteries only lasted six months and started resetting its own time after nine) but in the end I come back to this watch. You can't find more value for your money. Classic styling, precise quartz movement, 12 and 24 hour time, day, date, alarm, chronograph, light, and water resistance all for $10. You'd be stupid to buy anything else. This watch is a conversation piece. It's retro without being ironic; it's as elegant as it is rugged. Bravo, Casio. Bravo.",1
5,Purchased for my wife and she loves it. She needed to protect her skin from the sun after her facial treatments. Works great!!!!,1
5,"I can't even begin to describe how much I love these aviators. I've had them for a couple months now and every time I put them on it's like i'm seeing in Sony Cinema 4K with polarized lenses. I look at the clouds in the sky and I can see every detail, curve, color, shade, what have you. These are my favorite shades and I'll probably never own a different pair.",1
4,"Cute patterns caught my eye.  I purchased to keep a couple for my bag so I'm always ready at the store, and decided to give out to family as they left our home from the holidays.  Everyone appreciated the ability to fold and store in their purses or coat pockets and the bags were roomy enough to carry their gift(s).  They too liked the pattern I chose for them",1
2,"I LOVE these, and ordered 2. Gave a 2 star rating because the hardware on my first order completely broke off within 2 months! Fabric and stitching is perfect, but now must purchase new hooks for the first order, which is now unwearable,  and back ups for my second order, as they are of the same flimsy hardware. Otherwise, would have EASILY given these a 5 star rating!",0
5,"Loved this skirt! I wore it with my mermaid costume for halloween. I'm 5' tall exactly, about 123 pounds, size 28 or a 6 & sometimes an 8 in jeans/shorts depending on how they fit & I ordered a MEDIUM in this skirt & it fit great! The only thing is because I'm so short it was a little long on me but I just folded the waist band once & pulled it up fairly high.",1
5,Very nice to work in,1
2,Very tiny stones.  Not what I expected from the picture.,0
1,"Hat was nice, was larger than my head...",0
5,Super cute and comfortable dress! I love the floral print!,1
5,Was great.  Just what I was looking for and came in a nice gift box all ready to deliver as a gift for a special person,1
5,great value and nice looking purse,1
5,"I bought these for my 2 1/2 yr. old son to use for when I do work around the house.  The loud noise from the drill & saw would scare him quite a bit.  With the earmuffs on, he has started to watch the work I'm doing from a safe distance and is no longer bothered by the noise.",1
1,"Not sewed good sequince is not straight, scratches you under the arms, needs to be sewed in more around chest/ arm area. You have to be six foot tall and put heels on to have this dress not drag the floor. Good concept poor excecution. Will be returning.",0
3,hard to use the reading part.  is too small to look through with out lots of work.,0
2,"It's not as pretty in person, and it was horribly wrinkled! I tried to get the wrinkles out but to no avail. It just looks higher quality in the photos",0
2,"These ""shorts"" are long.  They are much longer than expected.  The inseam is 7&1/2 inches and from the top to the inseam is 14 inches, for a total of 21&1/2 inches.  If you like shorts that hang well below the knee, then these are for you.  Not for me.",0
2,Child sizing.,0
1,"Strap broke after trying it on within 5 minutes. Also a little loose around the legs and worries me you could see up her swimsuit. Really wanted to like it, got it for a pink dinosaur birthday party.",0
5,really like them. They are better than some I purchased  at the store.,1
3,"I love the pockets, the material is a little thin but would be good for really hot weather",0
3,"Very nice design, but somewhat smaller than I expected.  Also, the silver was not polished on the back of the heart, which I found kind of strange.  I don't own any sterling silver jewelry that's not polished on both sides.",0
5,"These are great for kids who don't want to zip their coat up all the way because the zipper is uncomfortable on their chin, but still need the warmth and coverage. Also don't need to worry about a scarf dragging while playing or getting pulled too tight. There colors are vivid and they are so soft and cozy. Very pleased with our purchase. Bought multiple colors and sizes.",1
4,"I wear a size 12 in dresses, and I've ordered L before and it would be too tight for me. So I took a chance and ordered an XL and it was a little too big, but I made it work... I'm 5'5 and it was a bit long on me... if I went up or down some steps I had to hold the dress up. Overall,  it was a comfortable fit,  just a bit big.. the large would be been just right.",1
4,Had to take to a jeweler to have attached to watch as it needed to be bent some to get on the watch.  Now looks great with my watch.,1
3,Satisfied,0
1,This is a huge waste of money and fits a four year old.,0
5,"Nice scarf, dresses up any outfit !",1
5,I absolutely love it ‚Ä¶. Fashion nova has the bodysuit it‚Äôs horrible fit,1
5,It looks exactly like the picture and functions perfectly. A little snug at first but I assume it will stretch a bit. Holds all my essentials made me cut down on the less useful items in my wallet.,1
5,obsessed with these!! loved them so much I ordered another pair as a gift. the pearl's are beautiful and the gold is sparkly. they're delicate and noticeable at the same time. look really expensive,1
5,"It‚Äôs a perfect gift üéÅ for a wizard of ox fan. It‚Äôs simple , thoughtful, and super cool.",1
5,Works great for running outside in winter.,1
3,fades after one wash,0
5,Easy to recognize,1
2,They don‚Äôt work with my iPhone 14 Pro so I basically overpaid for thin gloves.,0
5,great though,1
1,Very cheap. Broke within a day.,0
5,Just as described. Super cute on. Love the ease of a one piece.,1
5,Adorable dress. Very cute and glassy.,1
5,"My wife and  daughter love them, exactly what they were expecting, delivery on time and for the price,  they are going to order more for them  and for gifts.",1
1,"If I could, I would give this 0 stars. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúsparkles‚Äù here. Only faded, ugly, plain fabric. Returning immediately.",0
3,"Okay quality, long delivery time",0
5,Very comfortable and breathable. I love that they are adjustable. Definitely good quality for the price of a 3 pack. A higher cost mask does not always mean it‚Äôs better- these rock!,1
5,Excellent quality. I use it to hold several sets of snorkeling gear so it's easily hosed down and hang dried.,1
5,Excellent...!,1
1,The quality is poor . The glitter comes off the cloths and goes all over my kid‚Äôs face and even eyes . That‚Äôs bothering .,0
3,"Seem to be good quality, but very narrow design.  They were uncomfortable on my son's chubby feet.",0
1,hate them,0
4,Strong perfect size and pretty,1
4,Great variety cute bracelets. They were a hit for stocking stuffers for the girls and boys. Just wished there were some macrame ones included also but still good for the price.,1
1,Nothing like the picture different pattern looks like a night gown insted of a dress,0
3,"I have several pairs of Pajama Jeans, different styles and colors, including a pair of burgundy bootcut cords, in medium, they fit me perfect. This pair of teal bootcut cords are no way a medium, they are a small. The waist is about 1.5&#34; smaller than all of the other mediums I have. Why is this? I guess my bad for not reading the reviews, but because I already own some, I didn't think I needed to. Disappointed and returning.",0
1,The watch press didn't fit the watches as advertised. I could not find a way to make it fit the watches that I needed to.,0
3,"They sent me the wrong color. They are soft, warm.<br />Run big.",0
5,I was surprised at the very good quality and thickness of these earrings considering how and inexpensive they are. I am very happy with this purchase.,1
5,Very happy with this purchase. Was hesitant as it‚Äôs not ‚Äúofficial‚Äù but for my 6 year old I didn‚Äôt want to spend $100 on a jersey. The quality was excellent (soft jersey material.. definitely not t-shirt like some other reviews) and it fit great. Highly recommend this product for the price.,1
5,Es un vestido ideal para resaltar la figura  de mujer ..,1
1,Not anywhere near expected. See through and tiny.,0
4,"These worked, but it was still kind of small even after ordering a size up.  The crotch of the tights still came about an inch below where it should have been.",1
5,Absolutely beautiful earrings. They were a gift for my daughter and she loved them.,1
5,"Se siente ligera y c√≥moda, la textura la tela es como esperaba.",1
5,"It's a true as the one lady reviewer had stated:  hides all kinds of figure flaws and is stylish/attractive as well.<br />And, the price was amazing!",1
3,Looks just fine but you get what you pay for- within four weeks the bottom completely separated from the top!,0
2,After one wash it was already faded,0
4,"These work well and stay on my little one's knee fairly well. I do have to adjust them now and again. I really like the Velcro, as it is softer and does not irritate her skin. They do the job of protecting her knees when she is crawling around.",1
1,Purchased to see how big a 100% silk scarf for this price would be. I expected a Barbie Doll sized scarf. This is a pretty scarf. It has a tag that reads 100% silk feeling polyester scarf. It is silky feeling and I gifted it as intended.,0
3,"5""6"" height, 140lbs.  Ordered large based on reviews.  Huge on me.  Even a medium would have been too big.  A small would have been much better.  Returned.",0
1,it is hard and does not move on head properly.,0
5,"They are super comfortable and fit lengthwise, but are super wide which makes them look like men's sandals. The arch support is phenomenal and I was able to walk in them for hours with no pain. I would definitely recommend.",1
3,had fun with kids but very they break too fast. Very low build quality,0
1,barely says on. very cheap.,0
5,Perfect little charm necklace...more than I expected for the price!,1
5,Love this! It is supposed to have a wide fit and I think it's adorable and half the price what you'd pay other places. I call it a win!,1
5,"it was just what I was looking for...perfect size, very comfortable to wear...no separate pieces and best of all sterling silver so no rusting!",1
5,exactly what I was looking for.  light thin and a simple color.,1
5,The material is really nice and they're easy to move in.,1
2,"The rose gold has all chipped away and is turning my finger green. The stone is beautiful but the metal is cheap, sadly.",0
1,Feels so cheaply made. Gonna be in the closet collecting dust,0
1,Runs very very small,0
3,"The fit is more like a XXL than a XXXL.  Other than the size being wrong it would have been a nice shirt.  It's a heavier shirt, so if you're purchasing this for the beach, you may want to rethink it.",0
5,I love the fit very cute dress,1
1,The latch broke within 2 days of having it.,0
1,The photos are completely inaccurate as is the sizing.  The item received is tiny.  the pockets and waistline come are at my rib cage not where usable pockets would be.  The total length is ok but the waist and pockets are ridiculously high.  NOTHING LIKE PHOTO.,0
2,"They are lightweight, but I didn‚Äôt like the quality of the lenses and the size +2.5 did not match, so I cannot wear. I ordered at the same time another pair from a different brand - they are perfect.",0
3,"I knew the reviews on this dress were great before I purchased it, but I was hoping for the best. Unfortunately, I should have listened to what the other buyers were saying. I am 5‚Äô-8‚Äù 130lbs and this dress was too large for me in the chest (like didn‚Äôt for whatsoever) and the sleeves were too short. The color is true to what you see online and it‚Äôs very pretty.",0
5,"awsome heavy bib apron. good Value, too.",1
5,"Good price, quick delivery, product is as advertised.",1
3,"The magnetic one is pretty large... And it really starts to hurt very badly after only a few minutes. I can't wear it for very long unfortunately. I really like the little one, tho. Looks cute and no one can tell it's fake!",0
5,I like it so much,1
1,"I am not a fan at all of this product. It is a very thin, more like night shirt material and truly is not flattering to full sized build. The necklace was cheap and junky.",0
2,"I absolutely loved these glasses when I had them.  They looked great on, were easy to keep clean.  Unfortunately, after having them for only a few weeks one of the arms snapped off. I tried to repair it to no avail and sadly said a too early goodbye to one of my favorite pairs of sunglasses I've ever owned.",0
3,"They are cute, but they are big!! I can pull off large sunglasses so they aren't to bad, but I mean they are HUGE!",0
2,Too small. Order at least a full size bigger,0
1,I took it out of the package and dropped it on the floor.  The metal part that attaches the strap to the purse broke.,0
5,Looks great  and nice color,1
4,"Def took forever to come but for the price is a nice suit, im 5.2&#34;, 155lbs, chose a xl cause im a 36dd and it fits good, had to take out the padding so I will feel more comfortable but fits.<br />Im giving it 4 stars cause the material is somehow cheap and the back doesn't have a clip like the picture shows so is tricky to put in and out and I have the feeling that the straps will break soon, let's see how long it last, might change ny review later on",1
5,Cute shoes and my son love them.,1
2,"Cheap. Broke on me this first time I wore, it also turned my skin green.üò≠",0
5,i've been using these straps for YEARS! i have also use every type of locking strap system made and they all fail. if you have used other systems and never had one fail just wait.... it will. this clip lock strap has never failed me in 15 years. and you cant beat the colors! bright and brilliant beautiful colors. they also have normal colors. but i prefer the neon colors.,1
5,"I got these socks because I ride my bike every day for at least 2 hours and am very hard on socks.  I tend to wear the same pair over and over, basically until they disintegrate.  I wanted to be able to have a number of pairs that I could cycle through and actually be able to wash the socks once a week or so.  These socks worked out great.<br /><br />I was surprised you actually get 6 pairs of quality socks for a price that is the lowest I have seen for quality socks.  There are some really low quality socks out there, but these are not one of them.  The construction looks solid, the fit is great, and it looks like there is some extra reinforcement around the toes, which is where I always start seeing holes pop up in my old socks.  I'm a size 10 1/2 and the fit me just fine.  They have the right amount of stretch and fit in my cycling shoes without any issues.  I also like the neutral color.  I wore them on my bike ride today and they worked out fine.  Again, I ride every day so if the socks start disintegrating, which I don't expect, I will update this review.",1
1,"I had to return these earrings. They were top heavy. They stuck out too far from my ears, causing them to fold under my ears. They not only looked awful, they hurt.",0
1,Nose bridge was smaller than usual. Not comfortable and the frame snapped,0
3,"I am on a search for ankle-length compression hose.  The first ones I tried, I chose by measuring the ankle, as directed.  When I saw my toes turning blue, I concluded that I had the wrong size.  Then I tried these.  The ankle felt fine, but the compression at the foot area was not sufficient.  Maybe this is because I have narrow feet.",0
5,Great for a Wedding guest!,1
2,Cheap!,0
4,Like,1
5,Love these!  But order a size down - they're huge!,1
5,Love it! Fits great. Light weight & looks like the photos. Arrived on time :),1
5,My daughter has thicker ankles and shes only 4months these sock are great quality super thick and comfortable but were a little tight on the top,1
3,Myself and a friend tried to attach these to the luggage but were unable to get one of them open to attach.<br />I  like the design but if you can't get them open there not worth having.  Returned,0
3,Fit is snug but will more than likely stretch with use,0
1,Horrible purchase stated lense size was 50mm but true size was 52mm.,0
5,Sexy bra i got black w pink true to size going to order the other white one thats avalible as well!,1
5,"I don't care if it's a baby bag, I bought it anyways! And I love it! It is big, it has tons of pockets, and it is nylon...so super easy to keep clean! Merry Christmas to me!!",1
5,Absolutely love.  the long belt allows to make it as tight as you need.,1
1,"As soon as this break or tears, which it will due to cheap material and poor quality control, you‚Äôll realize why the legit T.Rex Arms ready rig is worth the money. If you have to buy a second to replace you‚Äôll realize you could have spent the same on the real one and have had zero issues. Buy nice or buy twice!",0
5,One of my favorite dresses I own!,1
1,Cheap looking,0
5,"It is a perfect fit for my feet, warm and comfy. I like the non-skid bottom as I am recovering from a broken leg so I need to have that stability for my good leg. Funky designs, I chose several different ones.",1
1,[...] support peterbilt by buying from them yes them they have a place with a lot of cool items on it for instance I think on there this cap as $16,0
5,Very comfortable fit. Good quality for the price and I like the convenient carry pouch and detachable hood. The fit was just right. This is good for a season or two in a light-to-moderate rain environment in a temperate climate or with warm layers underneath.,1
1,The the trinkets falling apart,0
5,It matches the picture.,1
5,Pretty!,1
5,Really nice,1
1,Terrible. DONT waste your time.,0
4,I normally wear a 14 and so I got an X-Large.  I probably could have gotten a L as well for a slightly fitted look.  It's a flattering dress as it A-line and isn't tight.  The neckline is perfect too. Not too low or high.  Sleeves were actual sleeves and this ended at my knees. (5'5)  Fabric is soft and not super thick but not thin where it's sheer/cheap.  I would buy this again.,1
5,It's very nice. Nice color and perfect fit for me. But feel little bit larger another brand.,1
1,Down to the ground,0
3,Good sparkles but left a sticky residue.,0
5,used this at the Lady Gaga concert and it was perfect,1
1,Creo que no es totalmente plata. Seguramente alg√∫n tipo de aleaci√≥n. Se rompi√≥ justo el primer d√≠a la pulsera. El vendedor me devolvi√≥ el dinero.,0
5,Awesome stuff,1
4,"Good quality, It seems to actually be from the concert",1
5,Really well made wallet with a lot of space for cards! Even better the card slots don‚Äôt let your cards slide down deep into them like previous wallets I have purchased. I plan on ordering another one to keep when this one wears out!,1
2,"I super like the idea but it's a bit short and not enough to cover my bum.  Definitely a skinny girl skirt. The battery pack is exposed as well, not sure how I'm going to hide it. Oh well.",0
2,It was cool at first but very cheaply made. The sole came apart from the shoe in about a month. Had to throw them away,0
3,"it shaves ok, but not great",0
2,I am a dd and a size 12 and the size was very tight and unforgiving.,0
5,Super Cute!  Fits perfectly and will definitely look good in the snow next week :),1
3,the chochet part is not nice,0
5,"Looks just like the picture. It's actually a little bigger than I thought it was going to be, which is awesome.  My son is going to love it!",1
5,Nice and comfortable,1
3,Little small but it does fit,0
1,"Very poor quality, very cheap and flimsy. Christmas gift for my son and it's already broken. Do not buy unless it's going to sit on a shelf.",0

4,Muy bueno,1
2,"We ordered size small, but these gloves were huge on our elderly mom.<br />Guess that‚Äôs an inherent risk we take buying apparel online.",0
5,These are Christmas gifts for knitting friends,1
1,Used to be good shoes but had 2 pair  break on me.  Poor quality for high price,0
5,My son loves these socks! Fast shipment. Thank you!,1
4,"Not sure how well this rain gear is working for my son as he is on a camping trip right now. I had seen the Toggs in the store and in just looking at the large, I thought it would be too big for him (slim 12). After reading the comments I went on an ordered a medium. I think the medium is fine for warmer weather when his clothes don't need to be layered, but right now I'm wishing I would have ordered a large so that he could put the Toggs on over his jeans, shirts, and even a coat. It's quite nippy outside and they will be canoeing all day. The jacket is large enough to put on a few shirts underneath but the pants seemed just right (with a pair of polyester shorts underneath).",1
5,"I'm behind on fashion and just discovered how great scarves are :-)<br /><br />In my limited experience, I've found that I prefer a lightweight, but full-looking scarf to layer over sweaters and long sleeves.  It's actually hard to find a scarf that it not too thick where it looks like a traditional scarf for skiing, and one that is so thin it looks limp.<br /><br />In the package, this scarf looked like it would be of the limp variety.  However, once removed from the package, it was revealed to be a scarf of generous size.  The fabric is slightly sheer but can be fluffed nicely.  The edge is not sewn but is rolled, which actually helps it keep its shape.  The color was off-white--a color I associate with fall but could be used anytime.  It has enough length so you can tie it in many ways.  It can be looped twice around the neck easily.  You can also roll the scarf and make a tie in the front--very nice!<br /><br />I'm actually really happy with this scarf and can't wait to add it to my work and weekend wear this fall/winter.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",1
1,It broke the day I got it. No hard wearing whatsoever.  At least it was an easy return.,0
4,Lovely dress,1
5,Great hat,1
3,Had to return due to sizing.,0
3,"1"" buckle arrived as 1-1/2"". Refunded, didn't have to ship it back",0
1,Did not fit.,0
2,These sunglasses didn't even last me a month. It broke within a few weeks of getting it. Oh well. You get what you pay for.,0
5,"I have the same neckalace in silver that I had purchased from charlotte russe, and I was happy to find it on amazon in gold. Its very stylish and jazzes up any outfit.",1
5,It‚Äôs cute and the fabric is also too good. I ordered small and it looks perfect .,1
5,It wasn't what I expected ( I thought the heart moved around in the bottle ) but it's super cute and worth the dollar I paid for it. I'd purchase again.,1
3,Lenses are small.,0
3,This was not that flattering on me. I think it look better over leggings since it was not floor length.,0
5,As room parent it was my job to make up an end-of-the-year gift basket for our awesome 3rd grade teacher. I ordered this item and a bunch of other stuff and was impressed with the quality and sheer cuteness of them. Because of the color I think it could be gifted to any gender. Great add to our basket!,1
5,It is what it is. Say what you want. They're sunglasses so they can break if you're careless or they may not fit your dome right. I'm a BIG dude and these fit perfectly. They are polarized and look pretty good so I'll just take good care of them while wearing daily and driving my bad machine.,1
1,disappointed was excited to get this but extremely disappointed with the fit. Too small i even ordered a large and it could fit my 8 year old niece perfectly. didn't even go to my waist length was too short.we tried to return it and They didn‚Äôt want to refund full amount.,0
5,It's very nice and very comfortable. It was easy to install and I get tons of compliments. It's my favorite band!!,1
2,"I love this ear cuff, though was made poorly. The leaves began to fall off after wearing once.",0
5,great material,1
5,Grandson loves it,1
3,"I love the idea of this dress, but I took off two stars for quality. I wish I could rate it 3.5. I ordered the black/pink in small. The fit was great on the waist (27 inch) but tight on the bust and chest (34 c) Length was amazing, right past my knee (5.6) And the sleeves were short, more like 3/4 arm. The fabric was VERY thin. As if I needed an under shirt up top. And it was faded already, not only in color but a white cast as if it had been washed before. Camera somewhat picks it up. I don't think it will hold up long. Other colors may not have this issue. Overall quite comfortable. I could do a medium in the chest but the waist would hang too much.",0
3,but it ran small,0
2,Returned item.  Zipper was stuck and a few seams looked poorly stitched.,0
5,[[VIDEOID:d54c1f2f0e5000332a3938bbbcd14a60]] La mejor compra ajusta perfectamente al cuerpo!,1
4,"I wear an 8 always and these were tight on me and a little short.  They have stretched fine, so the tight isn't an issue but they are a little short for my liking.... they are just long enough for my foot.",1
5,"For the price it is excellent. The elastic is not strong enough for what I intended to use it for , which was snowboarding pants. Works great for regular pants. It stays to the adjusted size unlike other more expensive belts I have tried of a similar nature.",1
3,"Very cute, but too small for my average sized 14 year old granddaughter. Should have read the description more carefully.",0
5,Love it!,1
5,"Luv it! I wanted it snug, that‚Äôs the purpose! I did cut bottom up to fit higher & not cut off at legs... fabulous",1
4,Only that the  jacket ran a little small,1
3,"Don't get these if you're allergic to nickel. Besides that these are pretty cheaply made. Still looks cute, great for a costume/theme outfit, but not regular wear.",0
5,"Comfort and support from the moment I put them on. As an elementary teacher, I am on my feet all day. Concrete floors reek havoc on legs! No break in time, and legs felt great all day long.",1
1,"Fabric is very thin, you‚Äôll need to wear a slip underneath.  The seam at the waist is not even and the arm openings are also uneven.",0
5,Very satisfied.  Good size for my taste.  Only thing I noticed that the pink sapphire looks a tad cloudy however it is lab created.  Can't complain on price for 10K.  Thinking of buying a pair for granddaughter.,1
2,too small,0
2,rather cheap feeling for the price,0
2,looks cheap.,0
2,"This broke shortly after the Amazon return policy lapsed.  I'm bummed, it looked and felt awesome!",0
5,Great necklace at a great price!  Very nice weight and quality.  Looks just like the silver coin necklaces all the fashion bloggers are wearing.,1
5,Love It!,1
5,Great product,1
3,"Much smaller than I expected, but hey, it's a Casio and it works, so I am ok with it.",0
5,I love it. Thanks!,1
1,Make your feet hurt! Work for a couple hours for a funeral and could barely walk afterwards.,0
1,VERY small.,0
1,They give measurements for women... even checked the size chart but they are KIDS,0
3,"Good-looking & well made, however, their sizes are a bit off from standard gauge sizes. When I measured them with my calipers they don't even match the sizes listed on the packaging.",0
5,"These were the perfect size, not too big not too small. I love the color and the material has been great no issues with my sensitive ear piercings. I ordered them for myself for my birthday.  It was the perfect little gift to me.",1
5,These are thinner than my other yoga pants but still nice quality & very comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised for the price!,1
4,Good for kids or simple cosplay.,1
3,I was a little disappointed in the fact that it was not a two tone cap.,0
4,The dress fit perfect. And looks as beautiful as the picture,1
5,Love loved loved this dress! It fit way better than I expected it too! I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô7 about 200lbs. I ordered the xl and was completely satisfied. Would definitely recommend.,1
4,they are comfortable and they fit as expected. I am pleased with them,1
1,"I ordered this for my niece who loves Harry Potter.  I wanted the ‚ÄúI solemnly swear‚Äù quote.  I received a quote about ‚Äúit takes a special person to be a pastor‚Äôs wife.‚Äù  While I completely see the humor, it was not what I ordered.  To make things worse, I didn‚Äôt realize that it was wrong and I ended up giving it to my niece.  We all had a very good laugh, but it was still the wrong gift.  So I take the blame for not looking before giving, but still, it was not what I ordered.",0
3,Most of them are big and bulky and don‚Äôt hold to your nose well,0
1,"Took forever to arrive.  Hat is not standard cotton.  Feels very thin, almost like nylon.  Very disappointed.",0
4,"The dress fits well, it is pretty.  However I didn't give 5 stars because it doesn't hold the shape shown in picture, you would need a hoop skirt.  It also came very wrinkled.  It washes and irons well, but it did take a bit of work.",1
5,Just love it,1
1,They look as pictured but they are made cheap. They broke after wearing them a couple of hours.  I was disappointed because they went well with my outfit. I wont buy earrings online again.,0
3,"Let me start off by saying this bracelet is beautiful and was the second one I bought! The first one started to unravel where the connection that makes it smaller or larger is. I thought it was a fluke and bought another color. The second one I've had for two weeks and has also started to unravel, this time the tassel also fell off. Either these arent meant for daily wear, or the quality is a bit off. I'm disappointed because I think they're lovely, just to expensive to continue replacing.",0
5,Got this for a Ren Faire and it works amazing,1
2,es demaciado grande la tela me gusta,0
2,I did not care for this wallet. Way too small to hold my phone or anything else really. Didn't seem as durable as I would have liked either. I returned it.,0
2,"Ordered 3 as matching gifts, one arrived twisted and stitching came undone almost immediately",0
3,Not true to size,0
5,Awesome and stunning. Good size earrings. Birthstones for every month. Great gift for yourself or 12 separate gifts.,1
5,"A friend saw this on my wishlist and purchased it for me, it is absolutely beautiful, I paired it with a little black dress for my art exhibition and got compliments all around! it has adjustable chains in the back so you can adjust it to your waist and neck and it has an amazing weight to it. Absolutely love it!!!!",1
1,Worst hat ever it say its fits adults but it didnt even fit my 7 year old so pissed off i didnt even want to give it a star but it makes u,0
3,The blue eyed pair is fine the yellow eyed pair was bent.,0
1,"i could not figure out how to contact seller.  however, i loved these, even bought them twice and they broke both times. too late for me to get a refund by the time i wore them a couple times and they broke.  very disappointing.",0
2,"I‚Äôm size 145 about 5‚Äô4 in height‚Ä¶ I got the black one in Large, because that‚Äôs the size I wear ‚Ä¶ I love it it‚Äôs pretty and silky, But wow it‚Äôs HUGE, I‚Äôm not super tiny, so I wanted an oversized look but this is basically past my knees‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt look sexy or cute at all which was the look I was trying to go for  I probably should‚Äôve gotten a small‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs fine I will wear it as a nightgown",0
3,"Great shirt/fabric/make, but it runs about 2 sizes small. Sadly, had to return it.",0
1,had to give them away,0
3,Kinda thin but not bad for the price.,0
3,Got what I paid for.  Should have paid more for better glasses.,0
5,This bracelet went perfectly with my outfit.,1
5,"Muy bellas y de buena calidad, me encantaron.  Es un producto excelente, las recomiendo.",1
5,as i expected,1
5,Very good,1
3,It's charcoal gray not black. It runs 3 sizes small too. I ordered a 5x. I wear a 2x in top. It was a perfect fit.  I can see this may shrink a size when washing. Therefore a couple wears I'll be lucky. Also the color is more dingy than expecting. The cut is not long on torso. It's a bit shorter than I would have liked wit slots on side. For the price it's okay but a little disappointed.,0
3,I didn't like this dress so much on me but it is cute.,0
3,Cute but very stiff and very shiny!! Looks like the pictures.,0
3,"(3.5 stars)<br />Very accurate fit.<br /><br />I would have given these five stars, but honestly, at a 10 MPH bike ride with a 15 MPH wind, I could feel a little wind through them.<br /><br />Not a lot, but the temperature was in the low 50s, and I shouldn't have felt anything through the gloves.<br /><br />It's not a lot of wind, but if you're expecting to use these below freezing, you're probably going to be disappointed if cold weather bothers you half as much as it does me.(that is to say, a LOT",0
5,For my wallet and keys,1
3,"Keeps the sun off my skin, but it is so hot to wear.  I think it will be more of a go to in the colder weather.",0
4,"the polarized lenses definitely work to cut the glare caused by my dashboard when driving, it's like night and day.  I only gave it 4 stars because the frames seem a little inexpensive, but hey, they are under $20 so what do you expect?  I wear them all the time and would definitely buy them again if necessary.",1
5,"Love it. Just what I expected. Use it to keep sweat from dripping onto my glasses when I work in the yard and around the house. Also is nice to keep the bugs off my head from driving me crazy. Lightweight, cool, comfortable, and looks good. I don't like hats so its perfect for me as there is no brim to keep crashing into things which also drives me nuts.",1
5,"Bought these for my granddaughter who is seven years old. She loves them and they look cute on her.She likes to dress up and pretend a lot. Gonna order her a pink pair today,so she will have two colors.",1
3,Well made,0
5,"Haven't seen it yet myself, but Mom called to tell me she loved it.",1
3,Too many layers of heavy fabric for me and the front layer didn‚Äôt lay right.. returned it,0
5,Great quality shirt and the print job is really good quality too. Came very quickly.,1
5,Beautiful dress .,1
1,They looked nice and everything. But I went to the beach and I wear them once and because of the water ( I Guess) they literally got broken.,0
5,Granddaughter loves Elves Lego. It was her first set and she wants more.,1
3,Not for me.,0
1,"Fit is horrible, internal seams are bulky and make the gloves uncomfortable.",0
5,"6 year old grandson gift, he loves it!!!  Attached it to his backpack and said  ‚Äúthis will be the best school day ever,‚Äù",1
1,Turn black,0
2,Too short and fits weird at the top.,0
4,ok,1
3,"Very cute, but just a little bit smaller than expected. Still fits OK though :)",0
1,I'm not to happy at all I only got the bottom not the top when it clearly say two pieces,0
5,Fits good nice material,1
5,Nice product,1
2,Very pretty but the fit is about 2 sizes small.,0
5,Gave them as a gift last year for Christmas and my friend loves them she still feels the need to tell me whenever she wears them.,1
1,Does the waistband stretch?,0
4,"I'm 5-10 160lbs slim build.  It fit's well.  Nice hoodie.  It's very light weight,",1
5,Love these earrings. They feel great and they look great. I got the 3mm and  they are the perfect size for my ears.,1
3,"I like the look of these glasses, but they are made more for leisure than driving. They really don't block the sun when you are driving into it.",0
3,"Loved the look of this watch, however it broke only a week after wearing it.",0
5,really like this skirt<br />stretchy fabric,1
5,I like them came in 2 days early and exactly what I ordered,1
1,"The only good thing about this band is that it is adjustable, at least when the magnets aren't falling out and getting stuck together because they were poorly glued in. The color is also not as pictured--""new gold"" may look like a pretty light rose gold, but it is a weird yellow color instead. I was also surprised and disappointed that there was no case for the watch band, because it looks really weird if your watch is not a matching color and other bands I have bought from Amazon include a case. Overall, I would not recommend this band.",0
5,Love this necklace.  Its nice and light weight and looks exactly like the picture.,1
2,Not good quality and too small,0
1,Do not purchase from this company! Bad product and absolutely the worst customer support!,0
5,Todo,1
1,It was suppose to be a 4X was a men‚Äôs small had to give to my son,0
2,"Order next size up as they run small, and zipper won‚Äôt stay closed",0
3,Not bad for the price. I have would have given 4 stars but the purse smells so bad. Kind of like a cigarette and fishy smell mixed together. I am really hoping the smell fades by the time I need to use it,0
4,There earrings are beautiful. Loos better than I thought. A good buy.,1
3,"Totally different color than pictured so it didn't match the rest of the costume. It wasn't clear how to tie on the tail... you need to belt and it velcros around the belt/belt loop. It would have been nice to know that! Overall, they were cute, but the color was way off- they looked more like grey wolf ears.",0
5,Good little shoe for my 5 year old. Quality construction. Easy for him to get on/off by himself. Tremendous value overall. Very satisfied with shoe.,1
2,Love the style but the dress appears different in person.,0
1,Loops are not included,0
5,"I purchased another one of these in the size recommended and it was very loose on me. I loved the product though, so decided to size down. The recommended size for me is 3 x. 1X fits me perfectly though. This is gorgeous. I get so many compliments on this style.",1
4,The dress is cute and comfortable. The size does run on the bigger side.,1
5,nice little casual dress that is a bargain.,1
5,So far this is a very comfortable strap. I did read the reviews about it sometimes coming unscrewed so I make sure to tighten the screw into the camera before using it. But it works fine!,1
5,"The zipper gets snagged on the flap when I try to zip-up the shoe ,other than this the shoe fits and looks good.",1
1,"Please be aware! Do NOT buy this strapless bra. It's one of the worst strapless backless bra I bought. It didn't stick and keeps falling off from my chest. I have to keep holding it, to make sure it doesn't comes off. It was so annoying.",0
3,"A little small, but nice",0
1,This dress was awful on me very high neck.. the inside was lined but very uncomfortable the dress itself is very heavy,0
2,"This shirt is 100% polyester. It even says it on the box. I wore it and my body odor permeates into the shirt like any other polyester shirt. There is no copper for antimicrobial purposes in the shirt, just pure 100% polyester.",0
5,"I have been using this wallet for a couple months. I love the wallet and it works great. It is a very thin and sturdy wallet. I have minimized what I carry and am still getting used to not having my shopping cards etc. I have to plan ahead and choose what card to take when I need to go out. That being said, I keep my shopping cards in my car glove box so I don't have to worry about that. Since I have downsized my wallet, I can't tell you how much better it feels to wear some jeans that fit a bit tight. I can actually wear them without having a huge rectangle bulging out and getting in the way of sitting. I now put my wallet in my front pocket, opposite my smart phone. I wish I had a smaller phone now...",1
2,The sleeves are very small it can fit a smaller person  nothing like the picture.,0
4,My daughter wears a 4 and I bought a 5 and it's still too small. Her toes are at the top but they are really cute,1
5,This is absolutely fabulous..worth every penny,1
5,Was a gift and she loved it!!! Perfect!!,1
3,"Ever buy a shirt that felt so comfortable and nice... until you washed it the first time? Yep. That. The print is great, i love that.. but the shirt was only comfortable brand-new. Now it feels rough, thick, and cheap.",0
5,looks elegant,1
5,"I love my bag, so many comments on how pretty it is.",1
5,"Would fit a stocky baby, but my lil long, skinny 1m.o. is way too small for them... so, might fit him once he's up to around 10#, but not yet... strong to put them on him, though. Excellent quality, vibrant colors, great product all around... going to order a size smaller than I thought for my tot as well. Too bad they don't have a smaller size than this; I'd be all over it!",1
3,I bought it for my friend. I was not happy with the color. She sent me a picture and it was so different than the picture here. Much much lighter shade of 'red' - you could probably call it vermilion or brick or coral or a shade somewhere there,0
2,i wore the first pair one time and before my day ended there was a huge hole in the thigh. I don't know if I will even open the second one. I have another pair in this brand without issue.,0
1,"Lenses did not fit the frames, nor were they the correct color. I get the concept of you get what you pay for. However, with such good reviews I would have thought I was actually getting the correct set of lenses. I have purchased aftermarket lenses for Oakley frames for years. I wear them to work so when they inevitably get scratched I replace them. With these lenses I never got to use them so I can‚Äôt vote for durability, scratch resistance, or polarization. I think my biggest disappointment was when I returned them, I didn‚Äôt get an explanation, sorry, or we will take care of it. I just got send it back for a refund like I made the mistake. Bad customer service even on good products makes me reconsider ever purchasing from them again.",0
5,"I have several of these. Good price. I wear them for a nightgown, shorts, capris, jeans, even wear 2 for layering!!",1
1,"the blooms keeps falling off, after they came i loved it but after a few days the blooms fell off, i sent off to be replaced and the same thing happened with the replacement so i just got my $ back",0
5,"Great quality item! Gives my gear a more valuable look. It is a heavy watch band, but feels comfortable. The only issue I have with it is I have to make sure I have my charger station on the correct surface as the watches weight makes it more difficult for it to connect properly. This is resolved by making sue you have it on a very flat surface and maybe even placing something thin under the clasp. It really is a nice item and the charging issue would never stop me from buying another.",1
2,"The fit was okay, but the fabric was very thin. Even with shapewear it showed every line and seam.",0
3,"This shirt runs about 2 sizes too small. I'm about 210lbs, 5feet 8 and typically wear an XL in all clothes. This XL ran more like a medium or tight large. I definitely suggest ordering at least 2 sizes up, 3 if you prefer baggy t shirts.",0
5,Loved it!,1
5,"Love these shoes! Fit great. They don't last as long as I would have liked, but I wear them everyday",1
3,Nice,0
3,ok,0
5,Essential - always in my pocket!,1
4,not breathable material so you might get sweaty,1
5,very nice shoes. going on a hunting trip and these are already perfect for snow and cold climate. youll like these if you like the comfy felt.,1
5,Very happy with the tie - looks great!,1
5,Fits well.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 135 lbs and I got a size small.,1
5,"Arrived fast, fell inlove at first try on! Super comfy and the pockets are a huge plus. I feel slimmer and my butt looks amazing!!! Currently 4 months pregnant and these are perfect for my belly!! Definitely buying more!!<br />I bought a large, the size us true.",1
1,"These do not work!  They are impossible, first to get onto your glasses earpiece, and once on, they are so thick and bulky that your glasses do not fit well against your head anymore.  Do not bother to buy these, you will end up throwing them away!",0
2,"Works only slightly to stiffen a canvas,  western-style hat.",0
5,"looks really good on, nice dress especially for the price, fits exactly right, no issues at all with it, great dress to hide a poochy belly",1
5,"Well made, very soft material, fits true to size.",1
1,These are not comfortable to wear. It hurt the inside of my nose.. it was a waste of my money.,0
1,"Complete nonsense.nothing like picture,u can't wear it out of the door",0
1,It‚Äôs breaks right in your hand I bought it twice and both times it broke in my hands after three days,0
5,Looks good!,1
1,"I ordered these because of the lining, thinsulate and gripper pads for our cold Iowa winter.<br />Arrived in timely manner, but nothing like I ordered.<br />What I received was a pair of Wool finger mittens.  No lining, no thinsulate, no gripper pads.<br />I went back to Amazon to make sure I had ordered the right item.  I did per retailers description about the item.<br />When I opened them, the loop to hold the button , when wearing as gloves was not attached and the button fell off.<br />I disputed the description, but have never heard any feedback..<br />I have ordered from Amazon for years and have never had a problem until now.",0
5,Good heavy duty work shirt that is long enough to stay tucked in. No unwelcome views from the back side.,1
1,Looks like nothing in the photo,0
4,"Really nice. A good length. Not a super soft t-shirt, but thick and nice quality.",1
1,"I had high hopes for these pants but they didn't turn out as expected. They were too small, fight tight, and weren't flattering at all. I was really disappointed because they look so cute in the picture. Ended up returning these.",0
4,"Very well made and looks like silver.  I t looks great on but due to individuals different ear shapes, I had to make it a bit tighter to keep it from slipping off.  I would recommend this regardless.  I enjoy ear cuffs but don't need more holes in my head than I already have.:)!",1
3,"OK if it not too cold. Good for Fall, and Spring time.",0
1,It broke 2 days after we received it and it is small. Too small for my daughter or myself.,0
5,"Being so inexpensive I was prepared for this beautiful piece to feel and look cheap. I was happily surprised at how beautiful and expensive it looks in person. If you‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs too good a price to be so lovely, think again.",1
3,"I like the color, it's cute and it does fit (the medium fits more like a small. I'm athletic, 5'5'' and 130 lbs)",0
3,I love the fabric. But this is not the size as stated. Order one size larger if you want a loose fit.,0
5,"They look great on her fart locker. Seriously brings positive attention to her turd cutter, LUV'EM!",1
1,"Tarnished more than I'm used to, so grabbed some silver polish. Looks like copper maybe under the silver plate.",0
4,"Good fit, comfortable, but only lasted 1 year before holes started appearing near the knees (no I didn‚Äôt kneel down in dirt/gravel a lot).",1
3,"I am buying earrings for my granddaughters 10th birthday.  Sadly, the sapphires were too dark!  Pretty little earrings, just not the right color.  Well priced, and almost perfect...‚Ä¶.",0
5,"Love the gloves, warm and comfortable.",1
4,Love this oil case<br /> The only drawback is that if you put the oil bottles in it as intended they'd be hanging upside down if you hang it from something. So I put the bottles in the case upside down. Now when I hang the case from my purse the bottles are upright.,1
3,It is a good product,0
4,We bought these for my 6 year old who said he wanted something for his ears so he didn't have to hear the baby crying. lol. He does really like them and it doesn't hurt his head. It is adjustable in size. My only complaint is trying to get them to stay unfolded. They fold automatically and will not stay open unless they are already on the head.,1
5,This is exactly as described. Very comfortable and perfect fir,1
5,Perfect fitting and extremely slimming! Great quality bathing suit. Can not wait to wear till summer!,1
5,I like that it is easy to put on and take off.,1
3,True to size. Love the cloth. Doesnt feel cheap.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After first wash it shrunk. Still fit me but a tad smaller. Im worried that after a few more washing itll not fit me anymore. So gave a star from 5 to 3,0
2,It is not as pictured and I cannot use but too much to pay to return it.,0
3,"The print is exactly what I wanted but there is a lot of scarf here, even though the material is very thin and lightweight.  I guess I didn't read the description close enough because I didn't expect it to be 72&#34; by 42&#34;.  I wanted it to be an accent to a nautical themed outfit but I never did figure out a good way to tie it around the neckline without it being way too much material and being bulky looking.",0
5,everyone LOVES these glasses they are really trendy and they also have a green/pink film when in the sun but doesn't effect the ability to see.,1
5,It is a great gift,1
1,I saw this exact item in a boutique but bought it from Amazon when the store was out of my size. The item came and has absolutely no lining. It is completely see through and the overlay was tacked in the back and sewn into the seam on the rear so it makes it looks like the dress overlay is stuck in your rear. The package came directly from China and the quality was awful! The company is also making me pay for return shipping up front so buyer beware!,0
3,I was a bit disappointed with the length; more appropriate for a boy that an adult.,0
5,"Comfortable, washes well, very nice.",1
1,Sizing bad broke the first day it was worn.  Not very well made,0
4,Great sunglasses!!!,1
1,they were too high in the waist...they fit all but the waist...just an odd fit...had to return,0
3,RUns small,0
1,Very thin lens. Much thinner then the original lens. Will make the structure of the sunglasses different and very flimsy .,0
2,Bad. Just don't get it. Wayyyy too small.,0
5,It seemed a little on the larger side but was very cute and soft.,1
5,Great Hat!  Good coverage and adjustable fit.,1
5,Parents love you.,1
2,The shape is unattractive. It narrows toward the hemline.,0
3,"Sent wrong size.  Material is nice, light for warm weather. Delivery on time.  3 stars because I got the wrong size and now unavailable.",0
4,For me. To match purse I have already.<br />Price was great.,1
4,I think it be a little bit bigger,1
5,"First let me say, I am a fan of the Louis Pelle line of leather wallets and have several of their credit card cases and coin purses. Their leather goods are deeply dyed, thick, soft, and the construction has been flawless in every wallet I received. This Louis Pelle Genuine Leather Slim Minimalist Front Pocket RFID Blocking Wallet is no exception. The slots hold my credit cards and ID securely, and I like that it is a bifold style with ample space to hold my cash securely.  It can be used for business cards as well. It's small enough to fit into my tiny purse and or the pocket of my jeans. The fact that it offers RFID protection is a bonus! I am sure I will get many years of enjoyment from this wallet, and I highly recommend it.",1
5,Cute necklace!,1
3,"Had to return. I'm a perfect size USA size small 4-6. The size chart says small is 6-8  figured would be perfect it's 100% cotton will shrink. Wrong. Received and its very snug, fits like a petite small very short if washed would fit like a 2-4 XS. Very disappointed have to pay shipping and return shipping. Nice shirt if you are a junior or petite you will like but order size up. Updated my review to a 3 star because the shirt although too small according to their size chart, was good quality plus return went flawlessly and was credited properly.",0
5,This shirt is so cute. The material is soft and breathable for hot summer days. It flatters my curvy figure.,1
1,Its not worth the money. Not sturdy and waterproof as claims. Only thing is its compact thats it!,0
1,"The bracelet looks cute, but it is super stiff.  Very difficult to get on solo.  The clasp broke after 1 wear. Not recommended",0
3,"This is a cute shirt and it does have potential, but it didn't really work for me. I think the ruffle and the strings at the top of the arm are fun and that part looks nice. My main issue is the fabric. It looks cheap, it snags easily, and it's super thin. Since it's so lowcut, I wouldn't wear it anyway without an undertank, but one definitely needs to since you can see right through it(unless that's what you're going for). As far as sizing, I'd say it's pretty true to size.<br /><br />This shirt doesn't have long term potential, but if you're only wanting it for short term use, it might be worth a try. It's not for me, though.",0
5,The product arrived timely and is as advertised.,1
1,This is a piece of crap. I have used it for less than a week and this morning the strap broke at work. I went to put the long strap on to make it home till I could go buy another purse and the strap that came with it is missing the hook on one end. CRAP,0
5,these were a big hit at Christmas .. and great for the cold.,1
2,"These Copper Fit compression socks are not easy to put on and take off, despite what Copper Fit claims!",0
4,The Dress arrived in a small bag and itself it a nice poly jersey fabric. It has nice stretch without being thin which is a bonus. The Front Lace up detail is cool with the grommets. The lace up string is made of the same fabric as the dress - which isnt the nicest detail - but it can easily be switches out for a cuter tassel piece. The front slit goes to right above the knee. My only complaint is that the back zipper is too long for the shape of the dress and causes a pucker in the butt area as it extents too far down the center back seam. It isnt the end of the world or anything - it just isnt a perfectly seamless dress as I expected. It does Fit as Expected - I wear a size 12 and ordered a Large. It fits fine. - I did get this product at a slight discount for this review.,1
4,Good,1
5,So excited to receive this bag. Great travel bag!,1
1,Arrived broken. Had to return. Adorable earrings but not great quality.,0
5,"Love, love, love this stirrup pants! So comfortable and nicely tight! The fabric is thick enough that makes me feel comfortable to wear it with shorter tops. The waist band fits great and is not too low or to high, just perfect! The stirrup is comfortable as well. They run a bit longer on me (5'6'', 125 lb) but I actually like it:) Best yoga pants I've purchased so far!",1
4,I bought this to use in my daith piercing. Fits perfectly. You can wear it with the gems facing out or in if you don't want them showing.,1
5,Great quality at a cheap price!,1
3,"The straight and even the curvy ones were great! But the ones with things in the middle, for example the heart, it was too long so the bar couldn‚Äôt go through the other side sadly ):",0
4,I love these shirts. Only giving 4 stars because they took awhile to arrive. (like weeks)<br />Quality is good and fits as expected. I will order again.,1
1,Not good at all. Starts to fall off within 10 minutes.,0
5,"My wife likes this very much, but she lost the cross off of it, so I had to order her another one.",1
5,"IT LOOKED  FABULOUS AT THE OUT DOOR WEDDING IN EARLY FALL<br />I RECEIVED MANY OUT STANDING COMPLIMENTS<br />FOR THE PRICE , IT LOOKED LIKE I HAD  PAID HIGH PRICED FOR IT<br /><br />I'M GOING TO ORDER A WHITE  & A BLACK ONE BEFORE SPRING TIME ,,,,,,,,,,,,<br />IT'S LOVELY , ESPECIALLY ,  LOOKS LIKE  PUKKA SHELLS<br /><br />& I ACTUALLY WENT ON AMAZON , & FOUND A BRACELET & EARRINGS TO MATCH PERFECTLY MADE OUT OF THE SAME MATERIAL ,!!  & IT WAS MADE IN CHINA ,,,,, TOOK APPROX 7 DAYS TO ARRIVE ,  JUST IN TIME LOL<br />THANKS AGAIN , I'D RATE IT MORE THEN JUST  5 STARS",1
4,Very nice vibrant colors but should have gotten a 1 size bigger.,1
3,"It was described as a flannel jacket, was very disappointed when I opened and it was a still material with a scratchy backing. The color was beautiful but I did send back.",0
2,These are very thin and on the small side,0
5,"Good for that night riding,  brightens up the way",1
5,I wore this jumpsuit for Thanksgiving. It is nice and comfortable.,1
2,Some of the seams are not straight.  I wish I would have inspected the dress carefully before it was too late to return them.,0
5,They are absolutely adorable and comfortable! I weigh 213 and got the XL and it fit beautifully.  I have purchased a second pair that‚Äôs how much I love them üòç,1
2,So i ordered a small and received a medium.not only that the medium fits like a large.,0
5,Breathable and comfortable! I love the leather feel! The most comfortable sandals to walk around in the house or in the pool area :),1
4,"Pretty freaking cool sun hat!!! Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is it didn‚Äôt fit my head, idk if it‚Äôs cause my head is big or if where it came from there heads are small. lol either way worth it.<br /><br />And btw it still sets on top of my head and strap holds it on",1
5,I love this suit!!!,1
1,"Very thin material, not like pictures at all",0
1,Threads are lose and falling out. Too small. Wrinkles easy. Shrunk when I washed it.the tag says dry clean and 35%cotton and 65% polyester like every other product from here.,0
3,"It was not for me, a short 59 year old looking for a hassle free dress for casual wear. It went back. I am a 6 and the small was too small",0
2,I did not realize how large this was.  Watch face too large for my wrist.,0
5,Everything meet my expectations,1
1,"I purchased the dress a size up so that the top would fall off the shoulder.... well, what I got was a cheaply made dress that clinged to my body is an absolutely terrible way. The shoulder cutoff was more like a normal fitting neck cut that even if you tried to stretch it out did not seem anywhere what it should have looked like. Do not bother to waste your time or money on a dress that is so poorly made.  Very disappointing.",0
1,"DO NOT PURCHASE<br />I was unable to wear because, like another review states, they do not close securely.  With one earring the least movement of turning your head, the closure opens.  With the other earring it WILL NOT close at all.  I went to return them and the shipping is more expensive than the earrings. SO, I'm stuck with crap!",0
3,Rhinestones not attached well. Easley fixed with super glue for the price.,0
4,"Great product for the price. Material in the white dress is not see-through which is absolutely wonderful. The medium fits as a true medium. However, my only complaint is that after 1 wear the button has already fallen off of the fasten of the dress. An easy fix but poorly sewn on.",1
1,"no me gusto para nada, nada similar a la publicacion",0
4,Nice compliment piece!!,1
5,"I've seen a lot of people posting that the spring on their clip broke, I haven't had that problem... My keys get thrown everywhere, from my pocket, to being left in the washer/dryer... This clip has been through a lot, and it's still running strong. The paint is fading/rubbing off in a lot of places, but I view this as a tool, not a fashion accessory.",1
2,"The set is very ""plastic"" but I guess for the price, its understandable. Its perfect for a DIY keyring.",0
5,Great quality and fast service,1
5,5 Stars......works & looks exactly as promised!,1
5,"Beautiful design and color, the fabric is pretty thick and heavy, I love it!",1
5,"I'm generally a size 6-8/medium, but I ordered these in a large and I'm glad I did. They fit perfect, having ordered a size up, and they are SO comfortable. I LOVE that they have pockets and the fabric is on the thicker side. They're not see-through and they feel amazing. I ordered them to wear on a cruise several months from now, but I'm going to get plenty of use out of them in the meantime. My only complaint (not that it much matters) is that they're not as flattering as they appear in the listing. Regardless, I will probably order a couple more pairs! They're perfect pajamas!",1
5,Fits nicely and looks lovely with a slight v-neck opening.,1
3,Good quality-just hate that the little balls really don't stay in place well. Lost the ball I don't know how many times until one day it was gone. Shipping accurate and quality-size were perfect.,0
5,"Love these! Totally converted.  My feet feel more support, took 3 mos to snag and my hot toes don't sweat so badly.  My shoes are loving it.",1

2,"La camiseta y la pantaloneta est√°n muy bien, pero los calcetines no llegaron. Me gustar√≠a saber c√≥mo puedo contactar al vendedor para ver si me los env√≠an o me reintegran parte del dinero que pagu√© por los tres art√≠culos, ya que como dije, los calcetines no llegaron.",0
5,she loved them,1
3,My little girl loved this outfit but the stitching around the cutout letters on the shirt are coming undone after just 2 washes and the tutu is made of polyester so seems to get really warm in it.,0
1,The color of the pom is not accurate.,0
1,"The bag was really flimsy BUT, I only paid $10.99 so I guess I got what I paid for. The zippers on the outside pockets keep getting stuck.",0
1,"Don‚Äôt waste your money ! Not even 2 months in, all of the hooks started to break. 6 months later and I‚Äôm down to 3 hooks! Made of flimsy plastic",0
2,The glasses seem to be adequate. The issue is with packaging. I only rec'd one pair of reading glasses. There is no way to make this right so I would use caution when ordering from this vendor.,0
5,Gift,1
1,"One month of a full time diesel mechanic wearing them and they‚Äôre worn out and have holes. I have the full length and they have lasted me awhile, thought these would be better for summer being shorter.",0
1,Was very unsatisfied will be sending this back. I dont feel it's made for plus sizes like it says it is. My body bulges all over and flows over the sides.,0
4,Great socks! Feet don't slid out of shoes when doing planks or hovers when doing my Core Class at the health club.,1
5,"Wear this so often. Easy to slip into, comfy, functional, and I can answer the door and get the mail in this beautiful simple robe.",1
4,Way Small to size,1
4,Posts are a little short but I don't mind.,1
3,Did not have a choice.  Only one that would fit half dollar coin.,0
1,DONT BUY,0
5,These Leggings are very cute on. Nice material and really comfortable and great price. I recommend .,1
5,This purse charm is beautiful all the way around.  It is larger than it appears to be in the picture.  I am pleased with the size and the quality.,1
1,Dress was see~thru and glittery. I was not expecting that,0
5,"[[VIDEOID:ea28daa677289f91e46de39bb2acb5b5]] The products arrived on time, well packed and very nice looking. I expected one in particulary (the one from the picture), but it arrived another one, similar. It didn‚Äôt bother me that much, so i gave 5 stars because they look very well, sturdy, nice color,  nice spark. It comes with a velvet bag and for the price, they are amazing. I chosen the 6mm ones because my piercing whole is small and the size of the belly pierces was perfect.",1
1,Wrong size.,0
1,Broken Bracelet and looks like has been used for few months. Be aware!!!,0
3,I was expecting a thicker material and it did shrink after washing and drying. So it‚Äôs snug on me,0
5,"super contento con sus cinturones nuevos le encanto esta super feliz, excelente producto y calidad se los recomiendo",1
4,"Bright red, loose fitting",1
5,Really comfortable and supportive.  Bought a bunch of these.,1
5,"Beautiful dress and extremely slimming, especially after week 25 and carrying twins.",1
4,"I'm a tall guy. Big feet, calves are pretty fit. I wear 15-16 shoes/boots, depending on the brand. I've never had a '2x' or some relative size shoe, so I didn't know what size of these to order. I did the 2x-3x and the 4x-5x.<br /><br />The 2-3x was snug on my feet. Made my toes pull in. The 4x-5x was a much better fit for my feet. But, the tradeoff is the 2x-3x fit better on my calf. Ultimately, I'd suggest going a larger size up, you can always adjust the calf later (rolling down or whatever) but you can't just make more room for your feet.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad product, just a bad description.",1
1,Size 8 - 10 is at least two sizes smaller than it should be.,0
4,A bit scratchy,1
4,"Bought this as a Fall and Winter bag, it is a nice charcoal grey color. It is very roomy, it does however have a horrible smell. Because of that I have only used it one time. It is put away in my closet until the smell is gone. For the price it is a nice looking handbag. I look forward to being able to use it once the smell is gone.",1
4,"Great nostalgia piece, smaller than you recall it being",1
5,"I loved the quality of the material! I ordered these as an option for my bridesmaids but wanted to try first! I ordered a small and the shorts were fine but the top wasn‚Äôt as loose as I wanted in the arm area, it‚Äôs definitely a great quality for the price! I just returned to size up for the arms!",1
5,Bought for my daughter for her bday. She loves it.,1
2,Very cheaply made.  The green color us also actually teal and not a hunter green color like the picture represents.,0
5,El vestido es apropiado para asistir a una boda diurna como invitada,1
1,I ordered 3 sizes larger and it was very snug and the sleeves were not as seen in picture. I returned,0
5,The cutest glasses I ever bought! looks just like the picture and it's worth it,1
5,Like it.,1
3,"Cute bag charm, although I was expecting metal vs. The plastic it was made of.",0
1,This shirt looks nothing like this picture. It looks like a pajama top,0
1,"Advertised to fit a 9 inch wrist, it will not even come close.",0
3,"Seems well made, heavy woven nylon, looks good.  But why make it 9.5 inches or roughly 240mm?  I can't figure it.  I don't have huge, thick wrists, but this strap is just too short (for me).  Adding another 1/2 inch of length would have made all the difference (for my wrist).  I did a little non-scientific survey of single-pass NATO straps around the web, and this strap is definitely among the shortest.<br />  I realize that wrist size is extremely personal and unique to each individual, so this strap might be perfect for a human with a wrist smaller than mine (at last measurement, 7.6 inches).  I can only think that the maker wanted to help wearers of this strap avoid the hassle of having to ""tuck in"" an extended tail end.  But if you find you have way too much excess strap end sticking out past the keeper, you can nip a bit off the end (I use a u-shaped woodcarving gouge for a nice rounded strap end cut) and seal it with a BIC lighter flame.  Easy and fun! Just remember---measure twice, cut once!  You can always make it shorter, but you can't make it longer.",0
2,At first my husband loved these flip flops. After 2 weeks of daily wear the piece between his toes broke so in the trash they went.‚òπÔ∏è,0
1,China doesn't understand American XL!,0
3,the picture on the t-shirt is rough and started to come off after maybe 10 washes,0
3,It‚Äôs fine for how cheap it was. I don‚Äôt like that it isn‚Äôt sturdy. It flips around while I wear it and the strap isn‚Äôt comfortable. But I‚Äôm allowed in stadiums with all my crap!,0
3,Material is stiff,0
1,The father size is waaaay too small. I got a 2xl and it's more like a men's medium. And it doesn't stretch even a little bit.,0
2,"Pretty, but didn't quite work for me clasp kept coming a loose, but ironically didn't fall off bracelet will fall off",0
5,I LOVE this skirt! Very cute ‚òÜ,1
5,I am pleased with the shirt.  The color was accurate and the material is good.  It didn't shrink with wash but I do hang dry,1
3,They're cute but they hurt my ears and broke shortly after wearing them,0
3,Looks much more sparkly and cool in the picture,0
2,White dots don't look like pearls and start popping off immediately.<br />Masks themselves are comfortable once I took all the dots off,0
2,Cute charms but one charm was already broken off when I opened the package.,0
4,"I love the style of these boots and they are comfortable with good arch support and wedge heel, but as others have noted they are hard to get on, I ordered a 6.5M but I have a narrow foot so I can pull on ok but not easily. I am not sure about keeping yet but I do love the style. 4 stars for style and comfort.",1
3,"There is absolutely NO leather smell and absolutely no Genuine Cowhide Leather Stamp either! It IS however, very well made. No longer own Leather & Taxidermy equipment - but I can assure you, this is NOT genuine leather! None of the dye had bled yet - that which is NORMAL for REAL LEATHER.  I am suspecting this is actually a PU Leather... a fancy name for imitation leather! I am keeping this belt because of the woven latices; which enables me to load and mount equipment on the belt.",0
2,It's really tight on my arms I wish I ordered a size bigger.,0
5,This product is made very well. Beautiful display for your keepsake.,1
5,OK so honestly the front is a bit odd; plain. It is almost like you're wearing your shirt backwards. Not bad. Just different. But I still like it. It fits true to size and the back is cute. I'll be using it as a coverup on my upcoming trip.,1
2,Ordered a size up from normal & it was still too small.,0
2,"I love, LOVE Gold Toe socks! Can't get enough of them, and wear nothing else to work where I'm on my feet 95% of my day. These socks last. However, this purchase was disappointing in that I received an opened pack with 1 pair missing. The shipping package was intact, the pair was missing when it was packed.",0
1,I bought this and it broke after a few days of mild wearing. Extremely disappointed and would not recommend for wear for more than one day.,0
5,Ahndy for all kinds of grabbing efforts...,1
1,My locksmith cut and programmed the key and I'm glad I only ordered one. It did not start my car. Locksmiths equipment stated it was programmed but it would not start the vehicle at all. Ended up just going thru Dealer. Horrible experience and cannot get refunded what locksmith does so it's a lose lose all the way around.,0
1,They ripped as soon  as put them on. Had to return them.,0
5,"I wish there were more colors! this really is a very nice maxi dress. It comes the the ankles (in bare feet). It has enough heft to wear in fall, but still appropriate for the heat of summer. I love, love this skirt! Please offer more colors. There is no lining and no real need to wear anything under it. There are enough layers to prevent seeing through it. I am 5'6"" and 150 lbs, if that helps with the length.",1
5,"This swimsuit was perfect for the Miami Beach. My measurements are a little weird so I initially ordered this in an XX-Large based off of reviews, but the bottoms were entirely too big. So I sent it back and got the X-Large. I could have used a Large or Medium in the top, because I am smaller up top then in the hips, but unfortunately you can't mix and match.<br /><br />Overall it was still a good buy",1
2,The sweaters were great but China sizes are way too small!!!  I wear a 14 to make sure it‚Äôs baggy.  I ordered a 2X it stopped at the sides.  The sizes are not US sizes..... so,0
3,"Kind of heavy, uncomfortable wearing them after a while",0
5,"These socks are wonderful!<br />I have a sister who is an RN at a hospital.  She works in the emergency room and never works a traditional shift.  It is nothing for her to be on her feet for twelve to fourteen hours straight, and that is just at work.  She also has three children.  So, when she is done with, or getting ready to go to, work you can add even more time to that.  I, personally, had no idea that these compression socks were a thing.  She happened to mention it to me one day.  She described how a simple pair of compression socks could make a tremendous difference in regard to leg pain and such from all of those hours on her feet.  Since that conversation, I have made a point to pick up compression socks for her any time I can get the opportunity.<br />Shortly after this compression sock discovery, I had another RN friend mention an occasion that I felt warranted a celebratory gift!  She loves fun designs and such, so I thought these would be perfect for her.  I actually ordered her both a white and black pair, and thanks to the wonders of amazon.com, they were shipped directly to her doorstep!<br />She said that these are fantastic socks!  They fit exactly as she would have expected for her shoe size. These socks provide excellent support without out being too terribly tight.  She actually had purchased a couple pair that were too tight to wear.  These are very well made and she was impressed with them.  She loved the fun design and that fact that she would be able to express a little personality through something so simple as a pair of socks.<br />Overall, we are both pleased with this purchase.  She now has a couple new pair of wonderful compression socks to add to her sock drawer, and I am glad that I had the opportunity to ease even the smallest amount of her pain.  She is one hard working nurse and she deserves wonderful gifts!<br /><br />PS - excuse the additional component of the picture.  I couldn't have mommy getting socks without the Bitty getting socks as well!",1
2,Instructions wasnt the best tops did not fit no matter the adjustment makes you have horrible over bit and cant talk and kept the bottoms in maybe an hour and they started fading,0

5,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 156 lbs, 39-30-41, 34DD; I ordered a large and it was very loose, which was unexpected. I would recommend a medium and will hopefully be returning this dress.",1

5,"I'm always happy when I can see Sperry's on sale - these are great high quality sandals.  I am glad Sperry did away with the leather tongue that goes between you toes, this one is soft material.  The sole is grippy with great cushion.  I am size 8.5 and this 9M fits perfect.  Classic Sperry fit with great traction on wet surfaces.  There is a small ridge under the toes too for good grip so your foot doesn't slide around.  Glad I came across this great deal!",1
4,I got a good deal on these so i purchased them. Great fit! I really like the way the material feels. For reference I'm 5'9 160lbs 38 DD chest and I ordered a large. The irony of this is that I don't usually ever wear pjs to bed lol (I like to be free if you know what I mean). I liked this set so much i wore it to bed the first night I got it. I give 4 stars because the image of the blue set gives the impression it has a gold trim. My blue set has a white trim. Overall I'm pleased.,1
5,Awesome accessory to every outfit!!!!,1
5,STUNNING !! Turn the perfect attribute to any evening outfit!!!,1
3,"Its OK, the glass ball and chain are nice but I wish the dandelion would have been fuller and fluffier!",0
3,"Very cute and easy to put on. However, after being worn for a while they tend to slip off the back of her heel and starts coming off, almost like there‚Äôs not enough support in the shoes around the heel and ankle area. So I suggest not to get them for long periods of time of wear.",0
5,Good fit,1
3,A little snug and color was not what I expected,0
4,The dress is adorable but tight in the bust. Other than that loved it. Nice material.,1
5,This dress is gorgeous and I love the sleeves. I wore it for engagement pics. I am 5'5 150lbs and ordered a medium. It fit perfect.,1
3,"They aren't what I expected. The sole doesn't have enough traction. Needs more slip resistance for a very active, boy. Very light.",0
3,This was bigger than I expected and because of that seemed a little cheap. The flower was more yellow than creamy.  It's about 1 1/4&#34; in diameter.  The detail was nice otherwise.,0
4,"Comfy, beautify dress; received multiple compliments on it. Ropes snag easily and pull off, dress is fine without them as they serve a decorative purpose only. Large busted women - the buttons do pull across the bosom. I pinned mine and they are fine, no one notices.",1
5,I purchased these glasses for my 13 years old granddaughter and she loved them...the glasses were inexpensive but adorable....would buy another pair.,1

5,Loved the earrings,1
1,"One of the quick release straps is defective and the strap randomly disconnects from my watch. So far I've been lucky in that my watch itself hasn't fallen and been broken, however, as you can imagine, this issue renders the product unusable.",0
3,"As most everyone wrote, it runs EXTREMELY SMALL.  I took into account everyone's comments and ordered a XXL.  I normally wear a medium to large depending on the fit, style and manufacturer.  This fits me &#34;good&#34; like a medium would, but I like my sweatshirts to be a little baggier.  The way the jacket fits I could wear a t-shirt under it, but nothing heavier than that.  I would have probably needed a XXXL they way these jackets run.  As far as the fabric, it seems a little &#34;cheap&#34;, not bad but not great.  A little rough to the touch on the outside, softer on the inside and feels a bit &#34;flimsy&#34;.  The style is nice.  I chose to keep the jacket, for the price it is okay and not worth returning.  I recommend reading all reviews before purchasing anything.  I might purchase this again in a larger size, just saying.",0
5,Queda perfecto,1
5,"I'm 5'6, #225, I ordered the 2X.  Close fitting in waist and hips when first worn, will stretch out/loosen up after a bit.  Very comfortable for lounging and sleeping.  Short waist, so careful when you bend over.",1
5,Excellent item as described and very fast shipping. Thank you.,1
5,Dress is beautiful üòç,1
5,Perfect fit but falls often,1
5,"This was the best! Originally I had ordered a Beauty and the Beast necklace for an outfit I got for Valentine's Day, but it got recalled. I ordered this the same day I found out, got it just in time for the special day and honestly think I got the better deal! Very intricate, nice for a black dress in the evening. Amazon does it again! :)",1
5,Very warm!,1
1,Horrible quality broke in like two days,0
5,"When I first open them up I thought they were scrubs for a second. But I try them on and I really like them. These are kind of like dupes for the Lululemon joggers. They fit really nicely I got an extra small and I am 5,3 for reference",1
5,Cute dress!,1
4,"I like these pants for work. Unfortunately, they are a little snug as compared to the jeans. I was expecting the cargo pants to be a bit looser.",1
5,Love itttttttttyyy,1
2,"Theses seem like very good shoes, but the insoles do not breathe .  This makes your feet feel and sweat as if they are in plastic bags.",0
5,"Love these ,love the fit ,love the material and especially love the pocket !!",1
3,"It is a pretty top, but the fabric is cheap. A seem in the sleeve tore the first time I wore it. It was easy to mend but I still prefer shirts that don't rip the first time I put them on.",0
1,"If you are bigger chested, I do not recommend! It is so incredibly lose, its just one piece of fabric so the straps are very weak. Looks really cheap if you take the padding out- the two slits for the padding are very noticeable.",0
3,"This runs a size too small, and the material is really thin. It‚Äôs cute Amazon my son can where it now in fall but won‚Äôt be able to wear it for cold winters and will likely grow out of it soon",0
2,I have bought other shirts from the seller and 2 I really like but this one didn't fit the same. it was smaller than expected. So disappointed in this purchase.,0
3,Looks nice,0
3,The shirt was cute but too small.  The large fit my daughter who wears a medium in all other tops.,0
4,did perfect and great quality,1
1,"Size is not the actual size that its supposed to be, the us size says one thing tag says another i needed an xxl and orfered the one that says us size xxl/ tag says xxl and the true size is xxl which is way to big, this should be changed because its misleading, if you order one thing it will be too small but if you order what u need its to big, im very disappointed with this purchase",0
3,"The band itself is really very pretty, and definitely makes a smartwatch look less utilitarian. The closure, though, is simply awful. Admittedly, it's easy to get off and on, but the giant cord lock thing digs into my wrist if I put my arm down flat on my desk, and the chains are so long that they dangle into everything, wrap around the cord lock, and get tangled together. The only way this is a good option for a closure is if you never wear long sleeves, and walk slowly everywhere you go with your arm parallel to the floor. For those of us who have work to do, having 2.5 inch long chains hanging in our food, getting soap on them when we wash our hands, and getting tangled around the lock and the band...just doesn't work. I have two of these, and I'll keep them, but won't wear them until I figure out a better solution for the clasp.",0
3,"This necklace feels a little on the cheap side, and it is HUGE. I knew it'd be big, but I wasn't expecting it to hang quite as low as it did. I actually bought 6 of these for my bridesmaids and ended up returning 5 of them. I had to keep the one I'd opened, but I did find a dress I could wear it with to another wedding, so that was fine. It's a good necklace for the price, just beware of exactly how large it actually is.",0
1,Originally bought these for the button straps but needed to use them with the clips too.<br />Second time I used these with the clips one broke...no response when trying to obtain replacement.,0
5,I gave this to someone for a birthday gift they loved it,1
5,Nice fit.,1
1,Waaaaaay larger than the size. The seller claims it to be leather but it looked like it was leather covered with what? Don't know but it was returned.,0
1,Very weird skirts. There's practically no elastic up top to keep them in place. Worst is they lose their shape after one wear. I am terrified they would slip off of me as I walk!?,0
5,"Awesome shirt.  Just make sure you order about 2 sizes larger than normal. I wear a medium normally, ordered a large,  but wish I had gotten an xl.",1
5,Gave this to my daughter-ib-law for Christmas yesterday.  She loved it.  The olive green color perfectly matched the vest and shirt I also gave her.,1
1,"Very disappointed, I only recived ONE SHIRT!",0
5,"My wife says only kids wear Velcro belts, but I say what kid wears a belt that you could hang a truck from? This thing is awesome, but maybe don't wear it to the red carpet.",1
5,"Nice color, as shown. Fits as expected. Looks really cute.",1
5,Very nice,1
5,It was more than I expected. My son loves his wallet and is good at keeping at least $1.00 in it at all times.,1
2,One of the gloves weren‚Äôt working.,0
5,Super comfy and great under open sweaters for winter,1
4,Good socks,1
5,"Thin sock, good fit, holds up well.  Especially good if you have hammertoes.",1
5,I like how elegant it looks around my neck and it‚Äôs very light weight . The price is not expensive at all. It‚Äôs a winner üëçüèø,1
4,I bought it for me but it is a real tight fit. I thought maybe I could make it work for my daughter who is 7 but it's too big for her.<br />Hopefully it won't lose style and she can wear it next year.,1
5,Everything,1
1,Broke after 2-3 wears. Eating post fell off as well as gold center came out. Bad quality.,0
5,This dress is stunning. I bought it for my son‚Äôs girlfriend for their homecoming dance. It looks exactly as pictured and is great quality.,1
3,The fabric is very rough and the waist has an elastic which is weak and stretched out.,0
4,"This skirt was a great addition to my wardrobe! It fits great, the quality was better than expected! üíï",1
2,The leotard is on the small side. It just fits but will not for long. I ordered the child small (4 - 6x) for my child who wears XS (4/5). There is a stain on the front of the leotard - about the size of a pea. It will not come out. Not pleased - will not purchase from this seller again due to this.,0
3,For the price it's ok I guess but its really see thru and tight around the arms,0
4,"I bought these shoes because they looked so adorible but there one  little problem the hearts on the shoes is silver but when i got the shoes the hearts had black marks on them so it looked very ugly,it looked like the black dye from the shoes got on the cute hearts and I know it was a manufacturing problem nothing else,lucky for me they run a little small and i got to return them.",1
5,Everything was ok. The watch is exactly as my expectations.,1
3,"first wear and ripped pocket, larger than expected",0
5,Work great,1
5,I got a 5x and it fits well.. I am 5'10 and weigh 220 pounds and I have 48 DDD chest and it's perfect.. I like them to be a bit bigger it goes over my big booty it's perfect!,1
5,I like the fact that they actually fit and weren‚Äôt big. I also liked the fact that they stayed on your hand and didn‚Äôt flip off. Great boy,1
5,I got this blazer for my toddler boy (4 years old) and it was super nice on him. This blazer jacket is good quality and true to both size and color. I love the color because it is easy to match with almost anything. I also like that is a jacket so he can wear in colder weather but is not too bulky so he can also wear in warmer weather. For reference I got him size 4-6. Absolutely will recommend!,1
5,This us exactly as listed. Great substitute for a big purse!,1
3,They are OK. A little big for my taste. The double row made them heavy.,0
5,As a larger woman I was afraid to order these. I am trying to get fit so I ordered these hoping they would be great for the gym. I am not disappointed. They are super comfortable and make movements at the gym easier. Occasionally they will kinda roll but not very often. Oh and I love the pockets!,1
1,Bag has great design in theory however every strap will rip if you actually put anything in bag and the zippers all broke within two weeks if using bag. Used bag for school binders nothing too extreme. Overall useless bag.,0
3,Pretty cool necklace but it broke first day i think I can fix it but still....annoying! Pretty low price though so...,0
5,"For those of us who do not have shoulders these shoulder pads are perfect!  It is important to square off your shoulders a little bit in order to balance your body type!  They are the perfect size, not at all like the 80s.  If you are in need of shoulders this is the shoulder pad for you",1
4,"I am overall pleased with these disco ball stud earrings. They are great for everyday wear. I did find the bottom two colors shown are a little closer than color than I expected. However, still beautiful. They seem to be good quality and don't look like cheap earrings when they are on. I like the size of these earrings as they are able to be worn comfortably to sleep. They are a good item for children and adults.<br /><br />My only con with this product is that one of the pairs matching stud back had the post hole in the completely wrong spot and it was not functional. However, I felt this to be a minor production flaw as all other pairs backings fit just fine. I was able to just use one of the other colors backings for the earrings. This was no problem at all, because lets face it... my jewelry box is full of earring backs but the earrings themselves always end up missing.<br /><br />I have gotten many compliments on these sparkly gems and currently the silver ones are my favorite to wear! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to have pretty stylish earrings at a very affordable cost. Also, any ladies with sensitive ears... These are non-irritating! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
3,"Size up...I haven't worn then because they are too tight. I also thought they had a built in bra, but they don't.",0
2,"I ordered these for a Christmas present, he opened them today & one of the clips was broken so he can only wear 1. Would rate higher if it wasn‚Äôt broken.",0
3,"Super cute, but the fuzzy part is not stitched on very good.  I plan to add more stitches to secure myself.",0
5,It's really cute.,1
5,Love the tote bag. Great transaction.,1
3,Really wide in the hips!! Unless you have major curves it isn‚Äôt flattering. Just looks over sized and awkward. I had to take in the side and sew a straight line instead of the wide cute it had.,0
5,Nice !!!,1
2,pretty but opal balls pop off too easy,0
3,"At $10 these are pretty decent sunglasses. My only problems with them is the hinges are too tight for the cheap frame around them and I have to be extra careful to not snap it in half upon opening, but I'm hoping it loosens up over time. Also the picture of the blue lens is quite misleading, upon opening the package I thought that they sent the black ones by mistake only to barely see a hint of blue in reflection, not at all close to the clearly defined blue shown in the pictures.",0
3,"Cute and sparkly BUT impossible to unscrew (had to use pliers). Once unscrewed, screwing the top back on is a pain and it does not align and looks crooked.",0
2,"Little stones fell out within a week of having them.  I was wearing them all the time... while I slept too.... so apparently it was just too much for the little cheap earrings.  I love the huggie type earrings, but beware of the quality!!",0
1,Awful don‚Äôt buy,0
1,"Great idea in theory, very poor execution.  Doesn't really catch the hair.  It's not adjustable and the ring of fabric is too flat to make a pocket space to catch the hair.  Nice try.",0
1,Recently purchased this luggage set and was excited when I recieved them. The middle-sized one did not hold.  Only used one time on an intrnational travel.,0
5,"Super comfortable! Fits my series 7 perfectly. Love the hexagonal shape of the holes, gives just a little bit more character.",1
3,quite narrow,0
5,Really great bag for the price.,1
4,"Very soft, comfy pajamas! The bottoms are long, but overall the set fits well. I would buy them again!",1
2,And colors are closer to fuschia and lavender,0
5,I bought this for my daughter and she loves them!,1
5,The material is very soft and absolutely the most comfortable jammies I have ever bought.....they are very true to size,1
1,"Feels like the texture of a cheap hotel sheet, which I shouldn't have expected more than, but still disappointing!",0
5,Love the way it fits,1
2,I am a US small. These were tight for me. The Beige color is much darker than what is shown.,0
1,"It did not work, was the same as the one that broke but it did not work!",0
4,was a gift but looked nice,1
5,Just right for my 3 year old to take on a trip.  Fit on her back nicely and not enough space to over pack her with weight.,1
3,The item is not as bright as pictured but it is pretty and easy to put on...only thing is my hair tends to get caught on the prongs holding the stone. So if you wear your hair loose often this might not be for you.,0
3,Material is really nice and warm but it‚Äôs too small. I‚Äôm 150lbs and 5ft 3in. I‚Äôm 3 weeks post partum so I‚Äôm still losing weight so no idea if I should keep them or not :-(,0
4,Strap was not included,1
5,Material is stretchy and there are pockets!,1
5,"Just what son-in-law asked for, well-made",1
5,Thought they would be a real red but I like them anyway!,1
5,"Great top.  You can pull it all the way down and it reaches about knee length, I am 5'5&#34;, or scrunch it up for almost a ruched look.  Very comfy. Received many compliments.",1
1,Its runs really small so make sure you get it two sizes up.,0
3,A little short and wrinkles easily,0
4,Fit nicely but they are very slippery.  Do not stay in place. Feel like they are sliding.,1
5,They are nice and padded. Heel support. Just so comfy!!!,1
5,Looks exact to photo.  Excellent.,1
5,Better than expected,1
5,"Well made, good deep colors. Excellent, embroidery with no loose or broken threads. Overall very sharp looking.",1
1,I was excited about purchasing this jumpsuit and put it on... it was disappointing!! The pleats were not in the top part.. so it lost the look that was in pic. I was told to buy larger size as the solution. ALREADY fits loose and unflattering!,0
3,"Love these books. They run a bit small so size up if your in between sizes. The company however, is not good at responding and will not do exchanges. There prices change drastically and they were not willing to do an exchange. They made me return the item and re-purchase in the larger size even though the price went up $10 after I bought it. I will buy other boots because of this. Not easy to work with.",0
2,"The material felt nice, and it appeared to be well made, but I couldn't get it on! I didn't realize when I ordered it that it has to go over your head like a sports bra. That's my fault for not realizing that it didn't have clasps. I have a small ribcage (band size 32), but this bra band was so restrictive (not stretchy like a sports bra) that I couldn't get it down over my shoulders to even try it on. Moving up a band size (or 2) would defeat the purpose, so this was a return.",0
3,It's nice covers important areas lol . You can wear to dinner with heels or casual,0
5,Very nice earrings. A little difficult to get in but with practice it is getting easier.,1
5,"Very nice. Fits perfectly. Color is truly oxblood red. It is not a thick material, wich makes it perfect for layering over black camisole.",1
5,great.,1
1,I bought these for my 5 year old. Were great. Loved them. Started to get holes so I purchased more. Got the same size and they‚Äôre way too big for him and can‚Äôt wear it.,0
3,"Im rather busty and its snug, its a bit long too.",0
5,"I adore this blazer , it‚Äôs not cheaply made & looking as I was afraid it would be . I will be purchasing another one .",1
3,We ended up using this as a shirt because it was too short for a dress. It either runs small or it‚Äôs an incredibly short dress. Garment is fading after a couple of washes,0
4,It looks great but it fits super tight. I'm 5'7 about 185 lb athletic and medium is usually comfy with room for me on most hoodies but this one is very form fitted. Looks great but not the most relaxed fit which is what I am used to when it comes to most hoodies so keep that in mind. Otherwise all is great,1
5,I love this watch!  I love the color!,1
4,"The split on the side is really deep,  I have big hips so the split was show a lot.  I should have size up. I going to order large next time. Super cute body icon dress  üî•",1
3,"I loved nearly everything about these except their size.  I consider myself to be conservative when it comes to jewelry, and these were not at all.<br />For some reason, I was under the impression that these would be the height of quarters but they are just about the height of my thumb.  They are also a tad heavy (but like I said, I'm used to wearing tiny hoops and studs)  They hit my shoulders if I so much as crooked my head.<br />Still the design and reference are great though, and I have gotten many compliments.",0
1,It says 3mm and the flat part probably is. But how am I supposed to get it through my 3mm ear if the opening has the snake and is clearly larger than 3mm,0
4,perfect blue for belle diy costume! would actually buy this in other colors for normal use! i‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 110 and the xs was perfect!,1
5,Good looking belt with soft supple good quality leather which I prefer to the hard leather that needs to be broken in. The ratcheting design is a good concept for when you add or take off a few pounds. Also it can be loosened when sitting down with a quick adjustment.,1
3,"Definitely size up, 135 5‚Äô4 medium did NOT fit ):",0
1,"Did not come looking like this at all, metal bar that goes around neck is pointy and so not comfortable, comes with no padding in the bathing suit, got and  immediately returned. not happy",0
4,"I bought this dress and a similar ( they looked the exact same) from another company on amazon. This was by far the superior of the two! The material was soft, the length is good, and the fit was much better! The color was a pretty, deep blue. Only four stars because while the material is better than the other brand it still feels like it may not hold up to many washings.",1
5,"Was a birthday gift for my daughter...sh loved it..and it was far from the reviewed descriptions, as they came across somewhat negative..for the  price I thought it was &#34; on spot &#34;....",1
1,"Very different from the ones I already had.  These are very short, they stretch out and ride up.  Also rip very easily.",0
1,Sizing is inaccurate.  Much smaller than scaling chart indicates.  4xxxx is equivalent to a teens size 12.,0
4,"good belt. belt stretches easier with less resistance that an old belts purchased 10+ years ago at California street fair. we will see how they hold up, but seems well constructed. size seems accurate.",1
5,Very nice variety,1
1,Very first time my son wore this a couple of buttons fell off....a tag fell off within minutes of putting it on... Not impressed!..,0
4,"The main reason I wanted these is because I have a couple pairs of shorts that when walking either work up my leg or they have a seam that rubs my leg causing raw spots or chafing which is painful.  For just daily normal wear it doesn‚Äôt do this but when we exercise, go walking (which is most days), jog, run, and hike, etc. it can be a real problem.  These leggings have eliminated that problem.  The leggings are soft and smooth and like having a second skin.  When walking the material eliminates friction so your clothes and legs glide against each other instead of grabbing and rubbing, much like bicycle shorts.  They are made mostly of spandex so they are stretchy and snug and supportive.  The Kolon Coolon material part helps to wick away moisture so you dry faster and stay cooler.  They are comfortable to wear and I don‚Äôt feel like I am sweltering and burning up when I work up a sweat especially in the heat.  They are thin, but they are a base layer, meant to be worn more like underwear under shorts and other clothing.  If they were thick I don‚Äôt think they would be as breathable or dry as fast.  You could wear them alone, depending on your comfort level, but I would feel a little too self-conscious due to the transparency unless I had a really long shirt.  It says to hand wash or machine wash cold or warm.  Well, my darling sweetheart thought he was helping and threw them in the dryer with the rest of my clothes.  I just knew they were ruined but they were fine.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing this on a regular basis though or you will ruin the elasticity of the spandex and shorten the life of your leggings.  I currently wear size  6-8 or medium but after reading some of the other reviews  I decided to go up a size and order the large which fit correctly.  I purchased my pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
4,Earring was great for my cosplay. Only downfall was that one of the feathers kept falling off. The appearance of it was exactly as pictured.,1
5,"Nice quality product, fits well and looks great. My husband loves it ‚Äò",1
4,"I got it so I don't have to pack my purse, it holds everything and I don't worry about losing my phone. I<br />I wish it had come with a matching strap.  Had to use my own and although it works good, I would like it to<br />match.  I also added a zipper pull so I know which compartment holds my phone at a glance.",1
5,Great quality,1
4,My daughter is ten years old. When I measured her she was a 9/10. After reading reviews I decided to order the next size up. Glad I did that. They fit her perfect I just ordered another one. I don‚Äôt know about the absorbency yet but will update when I know.,1
5,"The Charge 4 has a widely known issue with the stock bands being ""wiggly"" when connected.  Should be secure.<br /><br />Contacted fitbit support and they wanted me to ship them the whole fitbit first....even after they'd publicly acknowledged the problem, potentially leaving me with no fitbit for up to ten days, while they wait to receive and then ship a new one.  I said ""screw it,"" and bought these bands.  inexpensive and impressive fix :).  would buy again.",1
4,"Very cute and soft, the only (small) negative is that the whiskers fell out (very quickly) after receipt of item. Would buy again though, daughter loves it",1
3,This fits great and is very comfortable.  It isn't very cool though for the summer.  It does have a pocket for the carbon filter which is nice and comes with three carbon filters.  It would be great for fall or winter.  My husband is looking forward to using it for fishing and hunting as well :),0
3,Super nice üëçüèº but if you are chest is even a 32 your good beyond that it‚Äôs to tiny .<br />The cover up fits and bottoms but the bikini top is super tiny barely covers your nipples.<br />So other wise it‚Äôs great I just have to buy other top that is larger .,0
1,The handbag arrive on yesterday and as you can see by the photo the stitching and woven material is already unraveling. It‚Äôs a poor made bad and not worth the price. I am disappointed because I was hoping this could be my lightweight summer bag.<br />Not worth the priceüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ,0
3,"The cover up is so soft and absolutely beautiful. I waited a month for the suit so was very excited. Unfortunately the actual swimsuit was way too small, didn't even cover my chest. You can't do refunds, only returns, and I'm not waiting another month just to get the suit. I'm only keeping it for the cover up. Would get a refund if I could. I'm size Large with 38DD and didn't cover, order like 2 sizes bigger if you can.",0
4,Cheaply Made,1
3,"Comfortable in all areas except for the waistline. Unfortunately this cut into me, just exactly what I was trying not to find. Unlike some of the  reviews here, the package was professional and clean, no problems there.",0
5,Love these sandals,1
4,"I ordered several of these shorts and as other reviewers have mentioned, the material varies. Many are super soft and stretchy, while a few are a bit stiffer and less soft, though still very comfy. Unlike some other reviewers, though, I actually ended up returning the stretchier ones because 1) underwear lines show through more and 2) the pockets are so stretchy that putting a normal-size phone in them stretches the pockets well below the hem of the shorts. I wish I had had more info so I didn't have to keep ordering different varieties, so in case it helps, the ones I ordered that had super stretchy pockets were the blue stripes, blue and red plaid, and gray. I am keeping the navy star and tie dye 1.",1
1,it keeps falling off my wrist and I have lost 2 snaps,0
5,Worth the price. Very nice pieces.,1
2,Its a nice lopking cover but really doesnt hold up very well.,0
1,Absolutely disappointed! Poor quality!  The material feels rough like canvas against skin. Poor fit. Top is wide and droopy over shoulders and short length in front. A rip off! Worst of all the pics and description are misleading in that the lettering and logos are cheaply sprayed on with paint. Cheap look because paint does not seep thru correctly.,0
5,"Got kinda worried when I saw posts that the wrong (pink ears) product was delivered to users after I ordered mine... But mine arrived as it was in the description, in high quality, and in good time.  I'm sorry if other customers had problems because my order went through perfectly. Rave on!",1
5,Beautiful and pockets are a plus! Makes me look smaller! üòç,1
5,"This bag is a described. The smell of the bag is horrible. I had to put a scentsy air freshener in it just to carry it. However, I buy a lot of name brand bags, I bought this one as a travel bag so as to not mess up or lose my expensive totes. This thing is fantastic, even traveling with a million things in my bag at once it is still holding strong... I just might buy another one to give this one a rest. üòä The color is beautiful and goes well with everything too!",1
5,I love this bracelet. I am a big fan of Tory sandals and jewelry. This bracelet is simple but adds the right amount of bling to the outfit. I can wear it with an everyday outfit or if I dress up. You can't tell that it was bought on Amazon! Love!!,1
2,Nice skirt but my very large. My daugher is almost 5yrs old and wears a size 5 (XS) and this skirt did not fit at all. Had to send back.,0
5,I tried these on in the store. I fluctuate between a 10 and 11 depending on the shoe. I fit these comfortably (in size 10) with 3 pairs of sock on.,1
5,Bought this to wear as my wedding dress on NYE. Absolutely gorgeous. I'm only 5' 3 so I did have to take it to a seamstress to have shorten. They also tightened the shoulders for me too but for around the breast and back fit fine. Bought my actual dress size. It's very beautiful and flowy. Love it!,1
5,Great as first walking &#34;shoes&#34; :),1
1,Disappointed...the hat is very small like for a third grader.,0
5,Love them nice and soft,1
5,This ring is eye catching and minimal/no flaws. No ring box but it had no issues. My dad wears the ring often and actually got asked by a few people to look at it. He loves showing it off and wearing it. Highly recommend for anyone who loves sports and rings.,1
5,"(Back story: I'm the queen of toe rings and anklets!)<br /><br />Toe rings are great quality. Very sturdy and stay in place. I've worn these in pools, beaches and springs regularly and they slightly tarnished after 3 months! Others usually tarnish after 1 week!<br /><br />Anklets didn't last very long. Tarnished after 1 water related adventure.<br /><br />Toe rings YES Anklets NO",1
3,The ability to adjust the size.,0
5,Great product,1
4,My friend likes bracelets from many companies from Amazon.,1
2,Basically an iron-on logo that looks kinda cheap,0
5,Ordered a size up and it fit perfectly,1
4,"Cute shirt, a little snug and a little sheer, but super cute.",1
4,Well constructed. Roomy without being bulky. Dividers and pockets make it easy to keep organized.,1
2,The dress fits and is comfortable but I ordered the orange and they sent me the burgundy. So I am disappointed.,0
1,The key holder string is super flemsy. Lost my front door building key bc of it literally on the second day that I got these. Do not recommend unless you are willing to replace the string for a sturdier one.,0
1,"The hat has a sting very difficult was out ,DONT BUY",0
5,These actually fit an adult; and look great; I purchased them with the silver trim,1
5,Great little table. Good workmanship for price and I would buy again,1
4,"Cute sock and good fit, but discription was for 5 pair  (even though the picture is of 4 pair) and I expected 5 pair of socks.  Disappointed that there was this discrepancy, and just been to busy to contact the company.  Our Granddaughter thought they were adorable.",1
3,Cute sunglasses  but a little too small for my face.,0
5,My daughter loves these.,1
3,It smelled terrible and the buttons were rusted! After alot of cleaning it turned out to be a nice bag.....but the smell took a week to get rid of..,0
1,Based on reviews I assumed size would be good worse case slightly too big. Received it and it was not even close to correct size. WAY too small. It fit my 6 yr old son fine to give you a comparison of how bad sizing is.,0
1,"I am very disappointed in these shoes. I got them for what I thought was an incredible deal but honestly, they aren't even worth the $6 & change I paid for them. The first day my daughter wore these the insoles came out. The sizing runs very big. They are ok for back up shoes but honestly, they really should just hit the trash.",0
5,They look perfect on my grandsons helmet.,1
1,Love it cus it‚Äôs Mickey but it faded within a few days,0
5,"The fit, the flowing material, the beautiful print all flow together in a lovely manner.",1
3,Okish but not super,0
5,"The sock works wonders, can sit at my desk all day and still have an ankle when I get home.",1
5,These headwraps are convenient.,1
5,Good quality,1
1,I bought the white dress with the navy stripe. I read a review that said this dress was not see through. I am not sure what dress they were wearing but the one I received is very see through!,0
3,"The shoes are cute. My two year old was disappointed that they didn't fit, so I let her play in them and of course the sliding rubbed the back of her feet.",0
3,After wearing a year it starting coming off. So i guess $14 for year is not that bad,0
5,"Love this dress. Super flattering. As others mentioned it‚Äôs best to wrap in front and tie in the back, unlike the photo.",1
1,Very cheap looking and very heavy. Very large also will be returning as I cannot wear poor description of the ring!,0
3,My kids love the design but they are tight for my 4 and 6 year olds. I think the fabric isn‚Äôt quite as stretchy as some others we‚Äôve purchased.,0
5,good quality and perfect fit,1
5,"Hat is very nice, son not ready for the scarf, but will use when needed. The tassels could be a little shorter, but that‚Äôs ok.",1
1,"Wanted something comfortable for a wedding & dancing. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù & 180 lbs, made me look A LOT shorter & A LOT heavier. I think it‚Äôs due to the print on top; bought one all black & actually made me feel good about how I looked & my good jewelry look more expensive. Don‚Äôt recommend print on top for anyone my weight & height.",0
4,"A little thin, but nice shirt. Halfway between a long sleeve ter and a sweatshirt.",1
4,Nice watch for the price. Functional bezel isn't functional but no big deal. Clasp on band came apart once but easily repaired. I like the look and would purchase again. Fast shipping great seller,1
2,"I really wanted to like it, but one pocket was just one big hole with the stitching completely undone (and the fabric quality may not have ended up being the greatest).  Unfortunately, it was the pocket least accessible or I would have just stitched it together myself because the bag itself is perfect size, cute, and extremely functional in design.  I returned the bag because there aren't a lot of reviews to indicate whether this is a common problem and my trip that I bought it for is in just three weeks.  Otherwise, I would probably just try to order another replacement one.",0
5,This is a nice replica if the Olympic rings.  It is bight shiny silver and a nice weight.  The adjustable chain allows for lengthening or shortening as needed.,1
1,The material is terrible. It does not fit loose as it appears in the picture. I did not return it because there was no paperwork included in the package. Money lost!,0
5,"I think this is going to be one of my daughter's favorite outfits. I barely got it out of the package before she had it on! I bought the 6T even though she is in a 5 right  now. Sometimes these clothes from Asia run small. This one runs true to size though. She has loads of extra room in the shirt, both in the sleeve openings and in the length. The skirt reached all the way to her knees. The material of the shirt is not the regular jersey knit that we are used to with t-shirts. It is more slippery, like a spandex blend. The skirt is tulle over a lining so there is opacity. The skirt is sufficiently poofy to make my little one happy. Put together a ballerina type skirt, pink, and kitties and you have just made for one extremely happy little girl.",1
5,Love the fit and colors,1
1,Made me look like an elephant wearing a tutu. Returned.,0
2,Just get those temp tattooes instead.,0
4,Just as expected,1
5,These earrings are a good size and they are very lite. My earlobes do not get sore. They are a nice weight.,1
5,I love these earrings my sister ordered them and she gave me the last pair! I have a lot of scar tissue in my ears so my ears are very thick and I have been unable to find post earrings that are long enough to fit plus I have sensitive ears. I was going to let my ears close but decided to give them a try! I am so glad I did now I can finally wear earrings! Order these! You wont regret it!,1
5,Loved how large it is.,1
4,"My daughter loves these pj‚Äôs. She‚Äôs a big chipette fan. Fabric has quite a bit of spandex like material to it, it has a stretchy polyester feel to it vs a soft cotton material. Somewhat expensive for pj‚Äôs. However the chipmunks aren‚Äôt as popular these days. It would be hard to find elsewhere",1
1,Way too small! Might fit a child. Donated them.,0
3,These shoes are cute. They are cheaply made. Offer zero support. Will not hold up after several times wearing them.,0
1,No clue how anyone is supposed to wear these. The clasps are difficult to open and they just fall off of your ears,0
1,[[VIDEOID:f6b6c65307ff7b6ff08f79a4073efd0a]] this apron is nice design but very hard and stiff. needs to be a softer material. I have washed this apron 6 time trying to ge it to be more playable. It‚Äôs an awful grade of denim.,0
3,These are cute. Not as clear once the plastic is removed as I would like it too be.,0
4,"I really like these glasses. Their light , and fit my face really well. I'll wear these mostly when I'm active playing Tennis or chasing my son around the yard. Will probably buy another pair at some point.",1
5,"This is an outstanding bracelet for the price!  Although it's costume jewelry it doesn't look cheap.  It's VERY sparkly!  It also comes in an attractive aqua box with a jewelry bag inside.  I got it to wear personally, but it would make an excellent gift.",1
4,Very large for me,1
2,They were way too big,0
2,"I ordered the correct size, they seem to run small.  Not expected from Gloria Vanderbuilt",0
5,great,1
3,"The photo depicts this as mini dress length, but this barely covered my bum. Maybe if you have zero curves...<br />That said, it's a good color and very comfortable.",0
5,"Unique design, she was the only one wearing it at the concert",1
5,Great product!,1
1,I'm 5'4; soo cute BUT too long even w/ heels,0
3,I want to like these gloves because they're a warm jack of all trades protective pair... However:<br /><br />There's already a hole in the left glove's palm near the thumb where the stitching for the protective material meets the fabric.<br /><br />Also the Velcro straps dig in sometimes.,0
4,Love the looks of this item.  It is just not as thick as I anticipated based on the photo. I would still recommend purchasing this item to others.  I gave this to my daughter as part of her college graduation gift.  She liked it a lot.  My son saw it sitting on her vanity and commented on how cool it was.  He is 30 so I was surprised that it caught his attention so much so that he stopped to read it.,1
5,Works very holding heavy key sets on my duty belt.,1
3,"Decent for the money, seem to wash well.  Have used a couple of times so far and they help.  Just started cycling.  Padding is foam, so not sure how they compare to gel shorts.  But, again for money they are decent.",0
5,My sister loves it.,1
4,Fits perfect,1
5,Super cool sailing jacket! Bought as a gift and he loves it!,1
5,Very good experience,1
1,Was excited to receive these and wad absolutely disappointed when they arrived that they were completely tarnished. I threw them away not even a bother to return them. Ive ordered plenty of earrings from amazon and they have been amazing but i definitely don‚Äôt recommend these to anyone!,0
1,The bottoms were nothing like the picture!! Epic Fail!!!,0
5,"It's fitting, it's just right, it's showing, it's great.",1
3,"I ordered a large,  which normally is a loose and comfortable fit.  When the dress arrived,  I was ecstatic!  The bird print was lovely,  the fabric felt luxurious. This would be my new go-to-church dress,  when church opened up again.  Then I tried it on.  Could not even get the zipper half-way up.  A larger size would have been too long as well as too wide in the hips and waist.  So,  much as I love the look of it,  if you are ""blessed""  topside,  take that into consideration when ordering.",0
5,My daughter loves them!,1
5,Trent would be happy if he saw me running with this on my head. I believe this would inspire him to create another Broken or Downward Spiral. Maybe even a Fragile.,1
5,Great brand and durable. Friction fighter for guys with bigger legs.,1
1,I would recommend this watch to women or boys.  Little small for adult men,0
4,"This band arrived in two days as promised.  When I opened the package the metal clasp was not tightly seated in the band like the band that came with my Fitbit, but after putting it on it seems to be holding the two ends of the band together adequately.  I have worn it for 5 days and it stays on.  It is a nice shade of blue.",1
1,Nice band but the stripe is not red...,0
2,was smaller than I thought,0
1,the product is really bad in the part of the threads.,0
3,"It came sooner than expected(about 2 weeks). I ordered a size up and it fits a bit bigger, which is perfect for me. However I am unable to close it. I would order at least 2 sizes up if you are a bit on the bigger side and wish to close the jacket. I personally don't mind it. When I opened the packaged the bag the jacket came in was already opened from the bottom. The left sleeve came a little bit dirty where your wrist would be. It was also dirty underneath one of the false pocket flaps. The white hoodie part is actually just separate pieces of fabric attached to the denim. There are no pockets. I ordered the Toilet Bound Hanako Kun design. The design itself was actually a lot smaller than in the picture. I thought It would take up most of the jacket but its only a small part. Overall the jacket is nice, however the design part bothered me and is the main reason for the 3 stars.<br />Also note that if you would like to return it, you will have to pay for postage costs.",0
5,"Great, perfect fit and cute!",1
2,"Really wanted my wife to like this band, but the color was washed out.  She used it as a work band during the holidays so she didn't ruin her good ones.  Good news it does not crack like some others she has.",0
5,This is a great little ring that goes well with other stackable rings. I bought this and 4 other small silver rings like this for my wife for Christmas. The fit was just right and is able to mix and match with the other rings for a cool stackable look.,1
5,Hermosos aros. Muy buena calidad,1
5,They fit great!,1
4,Worked fine for repairing wife's shoes.,1
1,"When the product works, it works well.  However, I have had connection problems with both plugs.  Not wifi connections but actual power connections.  The sockets seem to turn off and not allow power to flow through them on a regular basis.  Then I must unplug the socket for a few minutes then plug it back in and turn it on.  They also have randomly turned off and on lights that are plugged into them.  I will be returning these products.",0
3,"I typically wear size 11 1/2, E width. My feet are wider than average. These Levi's shoes are size 11, but they're so big they come off of my feet as I walk. I'm returning them.",0
5,Very nice.  It was perfect for what I wanted.,1
4,"Love the design.  It is see-through though.  It is too long for me as well.  I'm 5'3"" and the XL is too long.  I was contemplating about getting a L instead.  If I get another one, I will get one that is darker and in a L instead of a lighter color/patrern.",1
2,Is there an exchange policy? Bought the shoes for my daughter for her B Day and now one wont charge or light up,0
1,Its REALLY small. Barely will clasp,0
5,Great purchase... just make sure you compare sizing correctly :),1
2,"Pretty but  the buttons came off after 1 wearing.  Also, they are *not* water resistant making them retain the cold if you handle snow.",0
1,Ordered an extra large and the shirts were still too small,0
5,I love them. I wish I knew exactly how to make them. I have several ideas.,1
5,Great product and great service from the seller.,1
5,My husband bought 4 more. It fits perfect. Great stretchy material. Does not fade. They still look new after a month of weekly wear. Great for outdoor work and high temperatures.,1
5,great,1
1,Pretty watch but after 2 days wearing it the white fake leather started to peel off,0
1,"I usually wear a 1x in American size, ordered a 3x and it was so small that I couldn't get it past my hips. It has little to no stretch, you would have to size up by like 4 sizes",0
5,My son loves this hat.,1
5,Just what I was wanting.,1
3,Purse is made of canvas which is durable but the lining is thin and tears easily. Also the zipper broke 2 days later.,0
5,"I love these.<br /><br />I tried the 20$ Haggers, not worth while if your into style.<br />(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXKMEY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)<br />I tried the Tommy Hilfiger ones, they seem ok, not good or bad, just ok<br />(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001THF9O0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)<br />And then these.<br /><br />I ended up returning the other two, and am considering getting these in tan and navy.<br /><br />They fit fine, aa bit looser than I would like, but I'm happy enought that I won't bother with changing a size.  I suppose I could always take them to a tailor if I see serious issues.<br /><br />Does anyone know which RL jacket goes with these trousers?",1
1,Arrived broken in half. It would‚Äôve worked perfect for my teens masquerade school dance otherwise.,0
5,"I love these.  The colors are beautiful, the style is classic and the frames are well- made. These frames have a solid look and  feel to them, and seem like they‚Äôre of good quality.  My optometrist had no problem using them for my trifocal correction.<br />I haven‚Äôt worn the glasses yet, but I suspect they‚Äôll hold up well.",1
5,These are real mans boots! Warm&Dry!,1
5,Love these sunglasses! so happy with this purchase!,1
3,"You get what you pay for so I didn't expect this to be the omg!  Magic trick but I am upset I ordered gold and got silver üò¢ I don't wear silver so this will never be worn and thefore is a waste of my money , other then the order not being correct,  it is a good product for the price it is smaller the. It looks though and looks a bit cheaper than the pic , but I expected that for the price",0
1,"I loved this band when I first got it, but within a week of having it, the button started to rust. I was trying to keep using it, but then it got to the point where the rust would rub off on my skin, and even after cleaning it so many times I ended up just getting a new band. Really disappointing. Don't buy it.",0
5,Super cute sunglasses for my little guy. He felt like a big deal when he wore them this past weekend. They are flexible which is perfect for those rough play times outside.,1
2,I liked these gloves for nightly use with lotion but  they did not hold up well with repeated washing.the fit was great for my hands which are small.,0
5,Love it!!!!,1
1,For a $30 short I expected quality.<br />Turns out that one leg was about 1.5 inches longer than the other one. Very noticeable on the rear side.<br />I will be returning this product.,0
4,Love the pockets. I am 5'11&#34; and it hits above my ankles. It is large on me. I am inbetween sizes (L and XL) I bought the XL and  its a little big on me. I could of gone down a size. But I think its true to the size of what you purchase.,1
5,cute as heck... constant compliments,1
1,Does not wash well. Very pilly and old looking after just a few wears. Disappointed.,0
5,I eloped and wore this as my wedding dress! Great quality for the price. Lace is a bit delicate as should be expected. I wore a beige slip underneath and the dress was thick enough so that you could not see through.,1
1,band is too slippery<br />keeps opening<br />hardly ever wear<br />I really should have returned,0
5,Fine addition to my earthquake survival kit.,1
5,Ordered a lot of different bracelets like these.  Love them all.,1
4,Got these for my father in law and he loved them the initial does give it a fancy look only thing is on one of the handkerchief the color of the R was smeared a little bit other than that it‚Äôs a great gift,1
4,The material is fine not heavy or light. But the sleeves are very long. I had to cuff them or keep pulling them up. Other than that very comfortable.,1
5,The fabric is very buttery and flowy. It feels amazing and fits great.,1
1,Extremely small. I'm not sure it would even fit my 3 year old daughter's ear.  Im not happy at all.,0
2,I had to return these they were way too small :(,0
2,"After reading reviews that this runs small, I ordered a 3XL, I'd say it fits more like a large. I'm usually an 18-20 and the 3X is like a 14.",0
4,"Nice material but zipper was easily broken, loved the design. Definitely should continue making these",1
5,"This tutu is so gorgeous - the picture did not do the sparkles justice!  The fit was great, and we can't wait for our daughter to wear it!",1
1,The size I ordered is bigger than I wear and this tank top didn't even fit. VERY SMALL. Size is not accurate.,0
3,"The red is not a true red as pictured but more like an orangey red. Also as shown in the attached photo, it was scraped up, right out of the packaging. Very noticeable.<br /><br />Customer service was terrific and very helpful.  I look forward to a time when they produce a deeper red. Thanks for your help Robin!",0
2,So I was really excited to get this but disappointed. I‚Äôm keeping it cause it‚Äôs comfortable and I can just use it under jackers but it‚Äôs not as pictured. It‚Äôs a shiny material and not dull like the picture shows it. Other than that the fit is true to size.,0
3,The buttons fell off right away,0
5,I used it on mothers day to church and everyone loved my hat,1
4,thx,1
3,Not exactly as quality as I had hoped for. Definitely sized to fit small.,0
3,No le sirvi√≥ al reloj.,0
1,Cute and reallyyyy wanted to love this but it runs so small! I even sized up! I read other reviews saying it runs big. Maybe I got a mislabeled size? Idk. But it fits like 2 sizes smaller! I like loose fitting shirts. This will definitely NOT work for me. Material seems comfortable though. Guess this will be a donation for me. Ugh!,0
1,Material was very thin and not at all what I was expecting,0
2,"I like the colors but the fabric it self you can't breathe at all  the silk is not breathable , I would not recommend them I'm gonna have to re purpose these for something",0
2,Low quality mask-what you see pic is $23.99 mask. What you get is $5.99 mask.,0
5,Fits great and the correct size.,1
5,So roomy!  Loved the way it hangs.  Great bag!,1
5,They work great. I don't even notice it under my mask for the most part. So far no problem will movement of any kind.,1
5,"This wallet is perfect, it has such a cute color, has so much room - enough for all of my cards, money, checks, even an iphone 7 PLUS can fit with ease. Amazing quality, zippers are often a problem with wallets but not this one - I would recommend this to anyone!",1
5,My daughter loves these sox.,1
5,My daughter loved this! It helped her hair stay out of her face throughout the games and was the only kind that didn't slip and slide off of her head. Highly recommend!,1
5,[[VIDEOID:cf8c8abc88fb4ba9654d9022fd8beb66]] I‚Äôll let the video speak for itself,1
2,"I don‚Äôt really know why this got great reviews from other people, because I found the fabric to look very cheap. It‚Äôs thin enough that for the bodice, you can see the seams of the lining going up, which looks quite hideous. You can see it if you zoom in on my photo for the top part. And for the slit, the fabric puckers and just looks awkward. I wouldn‚Äôt wear this dress out.",0
4,"Bought a large.  My son wears a medium, but prefers a little more room in lounge pants.  They fit comfortably, but not as expected.  Consider buying one size up if you're looking for roomy.  Other than that, they are very vibrant and definitely look like just like the Tardis.",1
3,Bathing suite is nice would have been better is they sent the size I ordered.. And I order up a side based on reviews but I think my size will be right two sizes up was really big,0
3,the dress looked like the description and fit well but was very voluminous and would've been much better on a  tall person. also the material was very creased.,0
5,"Love, Love, Love them! Great quality and fashionable. I also brought a pair for a coworker and she loved hers as well.",1
5,My son LOVES these shoes,1
5,Looks just like the pic! Love it!,1
5,"These Relaude cargo shorts are so nice for the price. The fabric is nice quality and comfortable. The fit is also true to size. The waistband is elastic, so no worries over it feeling too tight after eating a big meal! They stretch with you! There are 7 pockets and my son loves that they fit longer in the leg area.",1
1,Does not fit small kids to big,0
5,LOVE!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and it was perfect length for me!! The material is perfect and not too thick or thin. I usually wear a 14/16 in pants and the xl fit perfect.,1
1,Didn't fit.,0
2,"Do not expect them to be circular. Mine came more with horn rimmed edges. Also, the &#34;leopard&#34; option depicts solid Brown coloring, but they were very much leopard patterned.",0
3,I have a hat similar to this one except its made with thicker yarn type material. This hat is 28 inches long from top of ball to opening of hat. It fits very tight on the head and doesn't offer much stretch. I also don't like how its made with the extra hump on the stocking part. My other one is made as a long triangle. Im not sure if I've recieved a defective one or not because not many pictures are offered in the listing. I bought it because I like the Christmas story movie its always been one of my favs and I also like the colors as well. I like different. This hat really could've been made better for the price they are asking for it. I hope this gets posted because any time I don't give something 5 stars it gets rejected.,0
1,I ordered XL. I am 6ft 220lbs and xl is usually fine. This shirt runs really small. I have it to my son who is smaller.,0
5,Absolutely love this dress!,1
2,"The dress is pretty, the color I chose was emerald green, which is very beautiful, the fabric is quality however, the back is a lace-up, corset-like closure, and some of the loops were completely sewn. There is a thin line of sequins across the front of the dress which doesn't add to the dress but rather cheapens the appearance, If I were keeping the dress I would have the sequins removed.<br />The biggest drawback is even though a Prime customer the postage is not free therefore, returning the item is not free $$$",0
5,Beautiful dress. Very vibrant and flattering.,1
2,"Belt is not pure leather as it has a foam core.  There may be a leather composite, thin layer over the outside, but this belt will definitely not last the test of time and abrasion.  As a brand new item, it is attractive and because it is not pure leather, the foam makes it super lightweight.",0
3,I would've loved the watch had it not been so small. As it's fit for a woman.  As you can see it has to be measured including the crown in order to come up with their measurement. Note to seller THE CROWN IS NEVER INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE WIDTH OF A WATCH! This is a women's watch.,0
4,Love these,1
5,"The perfect glove for the winter in the north east. Thin enough to not feel like my fingers are useless while snow blowing the driveway, fleece lined to stay warm, and the smart touch finger tips are a nice bonus.",1
2,"Well, it's a sea turtle, not a tortoise. Cute if you like sea turtles.",0
5,I will be back to purchase more.,1
1,Ordered this night shirt for my better half it was excited to have it arrived.  Ordered extra large grey and thought it would go down to about her knees.  Opened package it's a white t-shirt looks very small for a child definitely not the extra large adult and gray,0
5,Love this purse and the price,1
5,Great earring. Heavy for its size.,1
5,I ordered a few of these for my teenage daughters for Christmas and they all loved them. Good quality and warm too!,1
1,"Not as described different material, returned got refund. No returned shipping label no way to print one so loat the return shipping so its not free unless.....",0
1,I took these to Mexico to my grandson the first time he put them on the tightner chord in the back came out making them unusable..instead of the elastic going all the way around the top it was glued in....how stupid is that.. how much money could they have saved by skimping on a couple inches of elastic!!  I can't send him new ones as he lives in a remote part of the Yucat&aacute;n with no post office. They don't stay on without the tightener.,0
2,"Returned.  Too small, though it is size I usually wear.  Very short.  Color not the bright red I wanted.",0
1,I have only had this a week and I only have 2 Crystal's left they have all fallen out. Totally not worth the money,0
3,"Cute designs, nice variety, but 2 of the 12 masks were defective...the design was just not good... eye holes didn't line up with where eyes actually are on a human face. I bought these for a dance costume, and well they really aren't durable enough for that., especially the tiny elastic strap on them. I guess there're just made for standing around in.",0
5,Great.,1
5,I am shocked at the quality in a positive way.  For paying just over $20 this exceeded my expectations.,1
1,"Defective, even not symmetrical. One shoulder is larger than the other. See through. Very bad quality",0
5,Awesome gift!,1
5,These are the only socks I take to Denmark. They are wonderful. I also lent the to a friend who went to Prague for New Years and she never wore any other sock!! They are tried and true. I recommend them to everyone I know who travels to cold places. You should work on the mid west and east coast for advertising.,1
2,[[VIDEOID:84b6b64bc5e35968efc66bb06cd3565c]] I purchased 9/30 it broke 11/5. My son literally wore this for less than 3 weeks. Not durable at all!  He said it was comfortable while it lasted,0
1,Looks like the top to a pair of PJ's,0
1,"When I put this dress on, my husband said ‚Äú It kind of looks like a polyester pillowcase with a ruffle on it.‚Äù<br />He is not wrong, as indeed it did.‚òπÔ∏è<br />It‚Äôs a very cheaply made dress,even the material is cheap and like...sweaty?<br />I got hot putting it on, so the material definitely doesn‚Äôt breathe.<br />Regarding the cheaply made comment,the print is not on the back of the ruffle or tie parts so that you can see the weird stretchy white side of the sash when you tie the bow for the faux wrap.<br />It‚Äôs also rather large in the chest area, but drastically less in the waist so it looks ... bizarre.<br />It‚Äôs like someone made a mini dress for Jessica Rabbit or something.<br />It‚Äôs not even that the dress is too big, which it is, its that it‚Äôs sewn with weird body dimensions so even if it was my size, it still wouldn‚Äôt fit right.<br />I‚Äôve mentioned the cons so I should probably mention the pros.<br />The pro‚Äôs of this dress are... well, it‚Äôs stretchy. Also, if you have a very large chest, this probably would fit you, it might be a bit tight in the waist area, but it‚Äôll definitely fit the girls.<br />Um... the back zipper is a nice feature?<br />Listen, they tried. If the dress were $12-15 dollars, I‚Äôd say give it a shot,  because maybe I just got a faulty one or something but at the price it is now, it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.<br />For your reference, I am 5ft, 103lbs, 24 waist,30 B/C chest. The dress was 3 inches above my knee, about 4 inches bigger in my waist and the bust would have fit a 36-38 chest.<br />I purchased a small. I figured it would be a little bit too big based on the measurements provided in the listing and I could simply sew it smaller, but it‚Äôs already sewn so weirdly that I‚Äôd probably have to take the whole thing apart, recut it, then sew it back together!<br />Not worth it.<br />I returned the dress and paid the $6 to have it picked up and sent back to whence it came.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0
5,"Great fit. I was worried the fabric would be too thin, but it was perfect.",1
5,Love it,1
5,"Strong, stays clean, comes with nice bagas and extra clasps.<br />Excellent, overall.",1
3,Gets the job done,0
5,Feels nice and comfortable,1
5,Absolutely love this necklace.  It‚Äôs so pretty. I thought it would be cheap quality but nope looks like I brought it from Daniels or something.,1
5,"This hat is cute , comfortable & I like it!",1
5,So many options and they don‚Äôt tarnish!,1
1,Pants did not fit like a xxl.,0
3,These are really nice and a cheap dupe for the Quay glasses but they fit quite loose.,0
1,Muy peque√±o,0
3,Not as expected,0
5,I love the necklace. It was a bigger than expected but other than that it's a must have. The gold is heavy and sturdy as well :),1
5,Unbelievably fantastic. Everything about these leggings is perfect.,1
5,Liked the product. I bought it for my girlfriend and it fits her perfectly.,1
4,nice and comfirtable,1
5,"The material is nice, not too thick or bulky. You could even wear a hat on top but still keeps you warm as is. Fits myself (small female) as well as my son with a huge afro",1
2,Bought these for my grandfather to keep up with his glasses and they broke after 2 weeks. The clip that goes onto the glasses stayed on but the leather came out of the clip part that holds the leather to the clip. *sigh* can anything be made to last these days?,0
5,The dress is soooo beautiful!!! Quality super and fits perfectly. True to size. I recommend,1
4,Nice watch band I would buy it again if it broke,1
1,Item is listed as plus size...I am 175lbs and can NOT fit them,0
5,Love these! Great for photoshoots!,1
5,"Worked great, durable and fit all the children perfectly.",1
4,"The color of the blush pink and gold are perfect together. So far the quality seems good.  However, it did run a little on the big side.",1
4,Love this dress. It would‚Äôve been every star if it was a little bit thicker just cus it‚Äôs really thin material,1
1,The pants fit too small according to description of size chart.  The fabric was shiny and not comfortable.  It was not a good purchase.  I returned item.,0
5,Very satisfied with entire transaction. My wife loved the product. I will order more customized merchandise in the future. I highly recommend this company,1
5,Gave this as a gift to one of my students (teenager) at the end of the school year. She loved it and still wears it to school this year every day:-),1
2,Its a neat collectable but I had to repaint and modify it to my standards... for the price I paid... it should have been better...,0
1,Did not fit my apple 6 watch,0
5,BEAUTIFUL PEACE!!,1
2,This is suppose to be shock proof and mine now has a crack in it from dropping it one time by accident and then it causes your phone to echo and most people cant hear you. I have to use a headset just to talk on it.,0
1,One sleeve is longer than the other .. horrible,0
4,They're ok. Hes not too fond of them but they do the job for the pool.,1
4,"If your looking for something to help smooth your shape and hold you in, these are not the shirts you need. If you want a skin-tight thin racer-back, then size normally; if you want a normal workout racer-back go 1-2 sizes up. These are nice, but not what they are marketed as. There is no compression. A ‚Äútight‚Äù (ie too small fitting) shirt does not equal compression because this is not the right fabric for that. Other wise the colors are pretty and material feels nice if you want a regular athlesiure top.",1
5,Love it,1
5,Shipped on time<br />Looks like the picture<br />and is worth the $12.99 you pay,1
5,Lotts of complements on this one!,1
5,I love it!!! Conceals everything!! Also lifts the girls (breasts) and the rump up!!,1
5,"Good quality sweater, very comfortable and good fit",1
1,Was ok,0
5,I have received many compliments on the pink/purple mask. People usually laugh because they say ‚ÄúI never thought I would have thought I‚Äôd say that!‚Äù I have at least 20 masks & these are my favorites. They are comfortable & I like the nose piece. I only wish they had a pocket I could put a filter in!,1
3,Nice handbag,0
5,"I love this dress it's beautiful the fabric is very light,very feminine. I recommend it",1
5,Simply outstanding,1
5,"cute glasses, colors are brighter in pic than in person",1
4,It‚Äôs a nice little wallet. I love that I can remove the money clip because I don‚Äôt always carry a lot of cash. It takes a little getting used to how to slide your cards out but I definitely feel like my cards are safe and aren‚Äôt going to fly out. The elastic works well with a small or large stack of cards. One small issue was that it didn‚Äôt come with instructions on how to remove the money clip. Wasn‚Äôt hard to figure out but would have liked to know I was doing it right.,1
1,Was able to wear it 2 times before it turned color,0
4,"Ordered these for my youngest son.  I ordered the medium size, and although they do fit, I had expected them to be a slightly looser fit.  If you're in between sizes, I recommend getting the larger one, unless you prefer your joggers with a snugger fit.  I've washed and dried them to test for shrinkage, nothing noticeable if they did.  Would recommend these, they aren't a thin material, nor overly thick. Can wear for every season except summer.  My son loves them, and skinny jeans are the &quot;in&quot;  style right now.<br /><br />Although I did receive this product free for review, my reviews will ALWAYS be 100% honest  ! Thank you!",1
5,I love my earrings thank you.,1
4,They serve the purpose for me.,1
5,"The first dress I ordered was a small and was to tight in the bust area. The second dress I ordered was a totally wrong dress and wrong size. Then I thought I'd give it one more shot and this time they sent the right dress in size the size Medium. I am glad that I hung in there til things straightened out, for this dress really is worth it. It fits very comfortably and the material is really nice and the lace is beautiful on it. I do have a black petticoat that I could wear under it if I want to change it up a little bit. I am 5'1 weight 123lbs and bust 34DD. I would recommend this dress if your looking for a party dress. Sewing was fine on mine, no loose threads to snip and the skirt is a little stretchy which makes it more comfortable. The waist was fine on the small but I know the medium will be more comfortable especially if I choose to wear the petticoat with it.",1
5,This top is make from stretchy comfortable material and molds to your shape. It's cute and sassy.,1
1,The back fell off and I lost the pin the first time I wore it.,0
5,I bought this as gift for my sister‚Äôs birthday. She liked it so much and it was exactly like described.,1
2,The fabric is more like a long sleeve shirt than a sweatshirt/pullover. It's also on the shorter end. The design does look like the pictures.,0
5,Looks good on me a little loose in the waste line get one size smaller in u looking for a tight fit,1
5,"I have plantar fasciitis and have been trying and using various compression socks and sleeves and arch inserts to help reduce the pain and prevent a recurrence once the pain is gone.<br /><br />These socks are not only stylish, but they feel great on and actually have compression in the arch area. There is also good compression in the calf area.¬†<br /><br />I ordered the small/medium even though I would take alarge/extra-large based on their sizing (I take a 9 to 9.5 shoe). I find that these are a bit long as I have to roll the top over to prevent it from comin gabove my knee. They fit me perfectly, otherwise.¬†¬†¬†I have several pairs of these socks and have worn their¬†socks all day. It feels great wearing them. I also love the styles they come in.<br /><br />These are not only ""fun"" but they are medically helpful for my plantar fasciitis. I wash socks like these in a lingerie bag and lay them flat to dry.¬†Currently, there is no price listed on Amazon for these socks but I would expect them to be priced in the $12.99 to $16.99 range. The only reason I lowered my rating one star is because they are larger than the size specified; otherwise, these are 5-star socks in my opinion.¬† ¬† ¬†¬†<br />¬†",1
5,I used them for Christmas gifts and they were a big hit. Very well made and exactly as described.  Thank you.,1
5,Cute and fun! Very soft fabric. Would get more.,1
3,"Picture in the ad shows that there is white in the strand that has wording, along with the yellow camo strand. Sons team is black, yellow and white not grey.  Some grey would be ok but without the white the necklace band looks very drab.",0
1,Took way to long to get...not satisfied...cheap looking hat,0
1,These socks are neither extra long or thick. The footbed is not for 9-11. I‚Äôm an 8.5-9 and these did not fit my foot and no stretch. I received to different length socks. They‚Äôre overpriced and misleading with how they present them on the site. Would not recommend.,0
5,Love it - ordered one size to big but im keeping it for my sister - thats how much i love the ring.,1
5,Fits as expected. Soft. T-Shirt material. The blue is very pretty,1
5,"Awesome little gift for my son in law, he loved it",1
3,"I purchased these to wear with my contacts while working on my computer / monitor  and having to look at typed information at desk level. I thought they would be more of a  normal glass at the top and as the lens went down the bifocal range would increase. I am not able to use these glasses with my computer / monitor / typed information on my desk. I am able to use them as just plain reading glasses and they work quite well for that purpose. The seem to be constructed well and look like they will hold up better than the cheaper ""drugstore"" cheater glasses. I am just sorry that I didn't really understand that they were not bifocal free on top. But it is not a total loss since I can still use them when I am not working.",0
5,I love the way this apron holds up !!! It‚Äôs lasted a while for me also ! Thank u Amazon !,1
2,"It fits really weird in the shoulders, and the color was way lighter that the picture.",0
3,Great,0
5,a great gift idea for dog lovers,1
5,Great quality,1
1,Cheaply made. On sleeve had hem.,0
5,"These are the perfect hiking socks! I bought them to wear with my Keen hiking boots and they were magical (as magical as socks can be)! They kept my feet warm without making them sweat, and kept them blister free all day long! You definitely can't beat the price! I don't know that it is necessary, but I do wash them inside out in cold water and lay flat to dry. I have had hiking socks shrink on me in the past, so I didn't want to chance it with these. I do highly recommend them, as I know I will be buying many more pair in the future.",1
4,"Love theses shorts! Fit nicely and ate well constructed .  I already had a pair , so ordered these to have an extra . Didn't give 5 stars because there We a tad smaller that the ones I have which are the same size .",1
1,"disappointed. very very thin, runs small.",0
5,Fits me surprisingly perfect. Love!,1
3,I ordered a medium and it was a bit too big.  But it still looked good,0
3,Weird fit in the hand kinda. Touch screen is non existent. Keep hands pretty warm with construction. Definitely not no-30 temperature. Barley good in 30.,0
4,"These are awesome pants!....... Got them for Xmas. I'm going to by myself a couple more, but guess what, I got the exact same pants from "" Wal-Mart"" ! EXACT FROM WALMART! LESS THAN $23.00 !",1
5,Just loved it!! It goes well with my authentic turquoise pieces.,1
5,Love these! Such a vibrant color and yet so lightweight!,1
5,This buckle will make you the center of attention at all the parties!!!,1
1,"They are not long enough at all. Seem like they were made for a doll. Do not buy them unless you have an extremely tiny head, lol",0
1,I thought the small was a 0-2 not a small 4 size. I don't like the material because it's cheaply made.  Refund..,0
5,"I received my order a couple of days, thus far it is fine.",1
5,This is actually the second one I have purchased. I loved the colors and shine on my first piece that I ordered a second one. Both are very unique in their coloring. No two will look alike. I have had so many compliments on my turtle pendant. If you love turtles this piece is for you.Just the right size too.,1
3,I give it 3 stars because the item looked like it was used. The package came open. You could clearly see it was tired on and top was stretch out. The ruffles on the skirt was all messed up.  On a brighter note I bought the exact item from the same company from Walmart and the sizing was spot on. Its a beautiful item otherwise,0
3,"I like the happy colors, but not the slip through strap. I prefer metal buckles.",0
4,nice quality. lasted a long time before the face peeled off. :(,1
2,uh yeah... the stud will NOT come off........,0
1,Loved them at first but they broke after 3 wearings- do not recommend-very flimsy-waste of money/ very disappointing,0
4,I love the idea it's kind of cheap but hasnt broke on me yet so I can't say it's bad but honestly for $4 I would expect that!!,1
5,So Amazon doesn't seem to have the sizing chart that I found when buying on a different outdoor recreational chart so I'll start with that:<br />S/M  |  L/XL<br />Arm Length<br />15 - 18 | 18 - 20<br />Bicep Circumference<br />10.75 - 12 |  12.5 - 15.5<br />Wrist Circumference<br />6 - 7 |  7 - 8<br /><br />That said I see people with questions on sizing.  I'm 5'10 ~ 175lbs and don't have huge biceps but not small either.  The S/M fit great for me once I saw the sizing chart and measured my bicep circumference and length.  I was just nearing the tail end of the S/M sizing chart.  I've had these on a few bike rides as well as some outdoor work in the sun for a few hours.  I didn't have any noticeable redness or burns in the northern Ohio hot summer days and they provide a bit of a cooling sensation.<br /><br />I picked up a pair of the Alloy color and will have to see how they look long term with use but I have other gear by OR and know them to be pretty good quality.  They are better tapered to be larger in the bicep than other cheaper sleeves I have tried and I like the optional thumb holes and slight grip ring placed on the inside of the bicep cuff to prevent the sleeve from slipping down.  I'm very happy with this purchase compared to others.<br /><br />At the time of this review these  were priced at $35.95 here on Amazon and at the place I bought them they go for $29.00 and I happened to pick them up on sale for $20.99 a few weeks back so perhaps I'm more easy going given how much I may have saved over other reviewers here.<br /><br />I'm bound to leave these in my bike panniers since they weigh nothing and I'd hate to be on a ride and forget to grab them if it's starts out cloudy or overcast and the sun comes blasting out soon after.,1
1,"Whole things were bent, cheap quality and can't even put my hand in.",0
2,Not the greatest quality.,0
5,Beautiful ring,1
5,The bra cup size is small.. but fits well... extremely long strings!!!  Not as gold..more black with shiny gold shimmer.,1
5,This mask really works great.,1
1,Very small purse,0
3,"I really like this necklace. You can wear them individually or in tandem. They layer well with other necklaces as well. However, it tangles easily. I spent 40 minutes untangling it. Then, while wearing it for the day it kept tangling over and over again. I really like how they look together but will wear them separately from now on. The hook holes in the back are great, gives you many options for length. Also, I like that the circle charm has a smooth side and a textured side. I‚Äôm all about options with my jewelry.<br /><br />I recommend storing these necklaces on a hanging post or separately in the plastic bags they came in, otherwise you‚Äôll have a hot tangled mess. Overall, a good product. Out of 5 stars, I give it 3 for style and -2 for tangled.",0
1,ALL THE PIECES FALL APART<br />BAD QUALITY<br />NOT WORTH IT,0
5,"I absolutely LOVE it!!!  I love the rose gold, very pretty, and I also love that the chain is adjustable, so I can have it dangle longer or shorter, depending on my mood that day.<br /><br />The Aquarius symbol is just so unique and so different from a lot of other necklaces out there, and I am just SO so so happy with this one!!!",1
5,Very nice.. Glad I purchaesd,1
1,"Not only is it not like the pictures, but I received one made Backwards!",0
5,Cute design.  Fits my daughter well.,1
5,This waist trimmer is so comfortable and easy to wear. I can literally do everything in it without worrying about it moving‚Ä¶.The delivery was very quick as well,1
3,"I'm 5' 7"" 110 lbs. These are entirely too big for me and I ordered a small. XS is needed.",0
3,"Easy to attach (and a little too easy to detach if the tab in the back gets pushed -- I've found my watch on the ground). But I'm a small woman, and of course the company can't afford to make different sizes. So I have a big hunk of leather sticking out . Still better than the artificial band that comes with the watch.",0
1,"when i got this product, it was broken. I put it back together and it broke again. Will not be buying this again..",0
5,"In the event that this item becomes available again, it is well worth the less than $3 cost (including super saver shipping).  It is marked 925 (sterling), is 1 and 3/16 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.  In fact, the size is such that it would work well on a necklace as well as a bracelet.  Also, the bale is large enough to accommodate sliding onto a necklace.  The picture adequately represents the charm, although I think it looks better in person.  The workmanship is excellent, with the back side finished off almost as beautifully as the front.",1
5,exellent,1
1,I trimmed it to for my shoes.  But the arch was way off for any support for me.  It really hurt more while using it.  And I even gave it a fair chance. I wish I could get my money back.,0
2,"Kind of cheap looking, but definitely not the worst I've seen. I'm 5.3 120 lbs and tend to find that &#34;smalls&#34; can end up either just righ, a little large or way too big for me (depending on company) - and this small was way too small, the last thing you want in a romper is for it to ride up and not lay right. . . . so I sent it back. For a smaller girl under 5.3, this could be cute! Or maybe on someone taller/thinner build, with long legs!",0
5,I love this show and wanted something that I can wear daily to represent.  I like that it is like soft elastic and doesn't in irritate my neck.,1
5,Love it. Very nice quality.,1
5,Excellent,1
5,"Fun pair of pants I bought for a costume, but I think they are cute enough to wear any time.  Thanks!",1
5,My son is 6 with sensory disorder and these are awesome for him. Lightweight and easily to breathe but providing the safety he needs from the virus. He loves them and im so hppy with the overall purchase!,1
5,Loved the crown even though it was way to big for my 1 year old. It was easy to assemble the small piece on top and was an overall hit. I'm definitely saving it for future parties! Also thanks for getting it to me quickly on short notice,1
5,I have two. One for work and one for social space. Comfortable and practical. Machine wash hang to dry.,1
5,"Arrived on time and was not disappointed. My child loved it! Would recommend it as a fine gift. Not as large as the movie one, but perfect to be worn.",1
5,Perfect,1
4,Fabric is really light but I like it,1
1,"Ordered 6.5"", received 5"". Child-sized. Have to return.",0
1,Not sterling silver,0
4,Cute outfit. It was cold so I didn't get to wear the shorts yet. But I still like it.,1
5,"It was perfect! Warm, soft and fit well. Only thing was was iffy on was it‚Äôs dry clean only.",1
5,"I like this purse very much!  I wanted one with firm sides that stands alone without falling over, and this one is perfect for that!  Since I started using a cane, I stopped using shoulder straps, so won‚Äôt be using that, but the other straps are the perfect length.  On many other purses the straps are too long.  This isn‚Äôt a large purse, so be sure to notice the size measurements.  It‚Äôs perfect for me, though.  There are pockets on the inside, and the main zippered pocket separates the inside into two distinct sections.  The purse closes with a zipper on top, but it stays pretty much closed on its own.  I don‚Äôt zipper it closed very often, but like having it.  There is a zippered pocket on the outside.  My phone sticks out of it quite a lot, so I don‚Äôt use it for my phone, but it‚Äôs perfect for putting change or receipts in the purse quickly, without loosing them in the main part of the purse.  I‚Äôm very happy with this purse and think it looks nice, too.",1
4,Looks classy. Use with a nice winter dress coat.,1
3,"Top fits, bottom runs a bit large.",0
3,They are Ok,0
5,Used for pictures with my daughter in a mommy and me session. I got so many compliments. It's very flattering.,1
2,"Poor quality, you can see the stitching in the front of the dress. Looks like a high school sewing project.",0
1,no size was even in the coat and I ordered a 4X,0
4,"Muy bonito y comodo, lo unico que no me gust√≥ es que lo necesitaba para el uso diario y m√°s bien es para alguna reuni√≥n u ocasi√≥n especial.",1
2,I ordered my usual size and lacked two inches closing at the waistline.  I decided to order a large today and they are no longer available.  Ug,0
3,Wasn't as pretty as my old one from the 80's but still a nice bracelet,0
2,"The necklace looked nice on and was great quality, but due to the design, the opening at the bottom of the charm got snagged on some clothing and broke the loop that held the charm to the necklace.",0
5,"I bought them for my granddaughter, and she loved them.",1
3,"Good variety of designs... but they are all the same size, my knuckles are not.",0
4,"Speedy delivery and husband, who is blind, is excellent.  Product works well.",1
1,wow what a disappointment! not true to size as the large was way too small ( I wear a 10) and the fabric was so cheap!! sent this back immediately!!,0
3,I don't like the size options. I feel like combining small and medium isnt a good idea.,0
5,"Got it to go with a costume, but wore it early and I get compliments on it all the time!",1
2,The buckle is pretty flimsy and the belt doesn't stay tight.,0
4,"Beautiful, good size and comfortable. I don't really like that the bars screw out of the gem in the middle though.",1
1,"The fit is ok now, but it being all cotton it'll probably shrink. Disappointed",0
3,"Ladies this dress is lovely please order your exact size when ordering this dress there is no need to go a size up , the hemming seemed a bit off however it's an  overall lovely gown.",0
5,"Ordered a large, but it was a bit too big. Usually wears a medium or size 8 in dresses. Once I got it take in it fit great",1
5,She loved it!!!,1
1,The product I received was not what's pictured! I received a dress that was super long & had a white band around the center of it.,0
3,It's looks like more of a white fleck on the nose than colorful opal like in the photo. Also a bit too thick. I thought it was 18g.,0
5,Awesome watch,1
5,"I am trying to think of a woman who wouldn't like this. Perhaps one of the very rare women who dislikes all jewelry, or someone with severe metal allergies.  Any other woman would open the box and ""squee"" with delight.<br /><br />And then she'd put it on.  I have been wearing mine since the squee stopped reverberating around my house, and love it.  It rides just below the collarbone, and balances prettily on crew neck sweaters and tee shirts. My husband rarely notices jewelry, but he noticed this and asked me if it was ""real.""  I told him it was a real necklace, and really made by Swarovski. He has learned enough from my jewelrymaking that Swarovski is famous for crystal, not diamonds, so he calmed down and told me that it was very pretty.<br /><br />That's an over-the-top compliment from him, equivalent to a squee on my part.  If you give this as a gift, the recipient will show a similar sentiment.",1
1,"Item arrived on time; the instructions tag inside (washing/drying) was missing (had been cut out) and the name tag with waist size was also missing. This item appears to not be as advertised (i.e., NEW)",0

2,See through and very cheap material,0
1,It took 2 months to receive these earring cuffs . They come closer do u must open them in order to put on ur ears of course 6 of the cuffs broke in half. Don‚Äôt waste money or time. Very disappointed,0

4,Excellent product!<br />I've used the product for a week now and am perfectly satisfied with the product.<br />Excellent build quality.<br />Everybody I've shown these to immediately wants one as well.<br />What I'm wondering for another addition to the product line- would be to also come out with a hat that has Bluetooth earbuds as well.<br />With just a small amount of wire extending out from the hat.<br />For some folks that would rather use buds style for the sound isolation outside.<br />Just a thought- but thanks for a great product! It's going to make my long working hours outside SO much more enjoyable!,1
1,"The large balls on the bottom are permanently affixed to the bar. For most people, this isn't a big deal but I prefer using 2 small balls in place of one large and one small.

3,While the outfit is quite cute it is very lightweight fabric and looks to run very small.  have not tried on yet as it is a birthday gift,0

3,"This bag is good quality but it is bulkier than I expected. I wish the company would include a picture of their bags being held by a human figure (model) to give a more accurate idea of dimensions and size.

5,This kit contains various sizes which is nice. The quality is great. A bit difficult to remove old tips so buying heel pliers is not a bad idea.,1

3,"It's definitely stylish and can hold a lot. I do not recommend this bag if you are looking for a smaller everyday carry bag. Such as you're going to a city for the day, this bag is a little to big for that in my opinion. The strap is also loose on my. I'm 5'11&#34; and about 150. Fairly thin dude and I could not get the strap to stay secured to my body even at it's tightest positioning. If you're a bigger person maybe it'll work for you. Or if you added some velcro attachments it would also work.<br /><br />It's stylish and very well made with many pockets. It's just a little cumbersome for me personally. If you need to carry a lot of stuff, (phone, several batter packs, a few bottles of water, snacks, a small book, a tablet, etc) all at the same time then I'd recommend this bag as it can fit a lot of stuff in it considering its size.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the strap is loose and uncomfortable for thin or smaller framed people. If you're large or muscular, it might be fine. Or if you plan to wear a coat it'd be fine too.",0
1,"Terrible terrible terrible. Material is see through, no stretch and not flattering. Very cheap looking.  Also, I'm 5' 7&#34; and the medium was about 4 inches above the floor. Waste of time and money.",0
1,"Purchased this item as a main item for a Christmas present. The shirt came in a bag with the tassels looped thru two completely unaligned holes. The tasss are super thick and not easy to put into the holes. After an hour, I could not do it. If they were already put onto the shirt as the picture design shows, then I would have loved it. The tassels are lose and will fray easily. Btw, the shirt is a dirty black color. It's not dark blue or black as the images show. Disappointed.",0
5,The glasses is so pretty,1
5,this thing is so pretty! the earing hook part had bent..got flattened in the mail or something but i was able to twist it back. This peice  actually fit around my ear nicely,1
4,"My fiend loves those shades. Wearing all the time , still as good as new, and they fit well.",1
5,my daughter loved these. they were for a christmas concert and they matched her gold and red dress perfectly! they did run slightly small but fit fine with just tights.... she was not able to wear socks with them in her normal size.,1
5,I bought these because they were cute and cheap and they serve there purpose! They are cute and my fingers don‚Äôt turn blue so win win!,1
1,Too small. Does not fit the same as a typical American cap. Total shipping including return amounts to $50 out of pocket for a $13 purchase. Not worth the hassle.,0
3,"I was very excited to receive & try this out as all the reviews stated it was easy to use and did not roll like so many others I have tried. Unfortunately, this design does not seem to work very well with a curvy frame and rolled horribly. I tried wrapping, re-wrapping, watching a video- everything I could to see if I was doing something wrong but it just seems to not be a good fit. For reference, I am 180lbs and measurements are 43-36-43<br /><br />Pros: Breathable, soft fabric, strong velcro<br /><br />Cons: if you have a narrow wait & wide hips it will roll like it's is it's only purpose in life",0
1,It runs super small and the beads all fell off.,0
1,Size not even close ...way too small,0
5,"Great Lenses.  Replaced originals which were scratched.  They went in with a little effort and now my Ray Bans are better than when new.  These are premium lenses.  They cut the glare and haze and make everything look clearer.  I love them for driving, hiking and even mowing the law.  Truly an improvement",1
3,Est√°n muy bonitos pero un poco grandes,0
1,"Que barbaridad solo lo use una vez , y se rompi√≥ todo de ah√≠ mismo lo tir√© a la basura antes ya hab√≠a comprado uno y sali√≥ bueno aunque se me rompi√≥ de la bolsa pero este otro se rompi√≥ de todos lados esos no sirven . Bote el dinero en ese mandil . ‚òπÔ∏è",0
5,I love my leggings they fit perfectly.,1
2,Used sanitizer wipes on this and made it so cloudy you can hardly see through it. Make sure to just wash it with soap and water. Lesson learned.,0
5,Very disappointed. Shirt is super cute & fits great but one of the stars on in the sleeve is all folded in on itself & when I straightened it out it ripped and peeled away from the fabric leaving big black spots in the star. It's straight out of the package & not even wearable. AFTER Leaving my review when I received a defective product the seller contacted me & sent a replacement. It's in perfect condition & I am now very pleased with my purchase & the costumer service.,1
5,"These socks are so cute! Good quality at a great price. I bought them for my 94 year old Dad who once considered a life on tour, but chose to stay home with his family instead. Golf is his passion and he still plays 2-3 times a week. He never would have worn a novelty sock 50 years ago but now he gets a kick out of them!",1
5,works great,1
2,"I have a lot of western button downs and or casual plaid shirts. First, Id say that the material is definitely not as comfortable as Dickies brand, Wrangler or Carhart. This brand is quite stiff and more polyester feeling than most. Second, I wear a large in almost every brand of shirt I buy, This brand, as noted by other reviews, feels much like a slim fit. I am not overweight but do have broad shoulders and chest. This shirt did not fit true to size in my opinion. Third, and probably most annoying, was the fact that having ordered two shirts from this brand neither was true to color. The amazon photos were MUCH more bright and appealing than what the shirts actually look like. This particular shirt was much more maroon in color than red. That said, I may try to order one size up and in a different color. The shirts appear to have decent craftsmanship.",0
5,"I got this purse in the other day and I was NOT disappointed!! Looks just like picture, good material, has a ton of space and the straps are perfect not to mention it came in a box that was adorable and came with a thank you card!!",1
5,"I bought this previous season softshell jacket on sale at a good price - I like it's simple design with some great features. It is water resistant, it will keep you dry as long as you aren't standing in persistent or heavy rain. It has a sleek fit compared to a puff jacket. If you live in the PNW, SF Bay Area, it's a great 3 season jacket. If you are in an area that has true 4 seasons, it will be best for Fall and Spring, or for those who layer or run hot during Winter.<br /> It has a detachable hood that can be rolled and stored in zipper area on neck. The collar comes up to chin, has a placket at top of zipper so you don't zip up your skin. The interior is a dense, fine fleece that is bonded to the shell of the jacket for good wind resistence.<br />If the hood hangs too low, there is stick on velcro you can buy to add to the jacket hood like some other brands have.<br /> Last thing, I almost did not buy this jacket because it has ""Camel"" embroidered on it, which unfortunately is a popular cigarette brand and my mother just had a lobectomy from lung cancerüò¨. I bought a patch to sew over that, so thought I'd mention that tidbit since some people may not want to look like they are advertising a smoke brand. Just an unfortunate coincidence. Otherwise this jacket is comparable to other name brand softshell jackets I have bought in the past and a good deal.<br />The fit is true to size- maybe slightly larger, but not by much. I wear a men's xl for the extra room, and this was as hoped, with room for a sweater or hoodie underneath.<br />I am a woman and buy men's jackets for extra length.",1
2,"While nice, didn't love it and returned the item. It ran larger than I was expecting.",0
5,"For the money. It is well built and fits nicely. Not much else to say. And for the money, it is a great deal.",1
5,Love this wallet and my phone even fits in it. Wanted something I could just carry or transfer from purse to purse.,1
1,"The shirt was a mess, the collar is different lengths on either side. Complete garbage.",0
5,Very nice and you can‚Äôt beat the price!!,1
1,literally ran 2 sizes too small,0
2,It is not Ture to size. A 3xl is not!,0
1,Like wearing giant cheap plastic on your ears.,0
3,"Not a soft fabric... too bad because it looked pretty, also didn't like that needs ironing.  I was looking for something that would look during a long evening.<br />Good customer service, had no problem with my return.",0
5,"I really love this bra. It's so comfortable. The pads give the bra kind of a weird shape when you're just looking at it, but it looks fine on. I'm not large busted at all, so I can't speak much on support or anything like that, but it works great for me. It fits nicely, and looks nice. My only complaint is that the hard circle where all of the straps meet up sits right where the top of my chair does when I'm relaxing at work - but then, I can't complain too much, when I'm sitting around at work.",1
5,Really nice comfortable gloves.,1
3,very small,0
2,Fabric feels and looks cheap,0
5,my daughter loves them,1
1,En una semana pierden el dorado y se ponen feos la foto es una cosa y la realidad otra.,0
1,"Cheap, smells weird and ths stitching was already undone when I opened it. I wasn't expecting much but the cats look more like beavers.",0
3,The left lens jiggles a little but overall it fits right.  I'm happy with the product .,0
5,Delivered fast! Exactly as described. High quality materials. Very classy. Definitely recommend.,1
5,"This was a life saver. It replaced a silicon rubber band that had caused a bad skin reaction on my wrist. Since the band travels underneath the watch, it gives added protection from excessive sweat and metallic contact. It come as a kit with 4 spring pins and a neat removal tool. If your tired of worn leather or weird composite rubber, this is the hit. I'm buying another.",1
1,Pants don't fit well it is  short the foot is big it's just a ugly fitting  Pants,0
1,As stated above the prouct was cheaply made with flimsy fabric.,0
3,"The dress is cute if you are a very petite young lady/teen or woman.  The fabric is very strange, very very strange.  Feels like rubber, and hugs and sits on all of the wrong spots for large/curvy women.  One size does not fit all.  One size fits upto maybe a size 6 womens.  Returning this strange little dress.",0
5,They are BOC....enough said.  I love them.,1
3,"Short was a bit small, but the shorts fit nice. I‚Äôm 132lbs, 5‚Äô2. I am busty so maybe that‚Äôs why it was a bit snug, but my arms felt like the hulk on it. Nice color and good cotton feeling material (not shiny)",0
2,It's pretty and looks like the picture but it doesn't lay flat on,0
1,Horrible,0
5,It fits my glasses perfectly and its very sturdy. I have had it for about a year and it's great!,1
5,Excellent vest at the best price....Great quality and heats up quick and hot... Highly recommend it....,1
1,I ordered these in preparation for a vacation. I wore them for 3 hours and they have rips all over the seems. The return window closed because I didn't wear them until vacation as they are capris. Extremely disappointed and would not recommend,0
3,I bought this in August. It fits great and pulls in everything. I do not like how the bra straps cut into my armpits. It's very painful.<br />Also I just pulled it from the washer and the strap has broken completely off of the garment.<br />I hope I can exchange it.,0
1,"Returned it,  battery case was too heavy and big. Felt awkward.",0
5,"Fits great I just love these bras hard to find but not at Amazon, love shopping here.i bought them for my wife!!",1
5,Just as pictured,1
4,Easy to use. Highly recommend,1
5,These are a perfect fit! My puppy found both of my GShocks sitting out... and chewed them up. These replacement bands are LITERALLY the exact replica of the Casio factory piece. Couldn't be happier.,1
5,"The Pandora beads make this an excellent addition to any jewellery lover. It's beautiful and a great gift for family, friend or self.",1
1,not what I expected just to larger and didn't fit right.,0
5,"Being short sometimes it's hard to find a dress. Good length and the pockets help to make this a little more flattering. I got the orange designed one, looks nice.",1
3,"The hat looks cool‚Ä¶ Like really cool. BUT the word villains under the brim is misspelled ‚ÄúVillians.‚Äù üò©. I bought it as a gift, so I was pretty disappointed. Other than that, it‚Äôs a nice hat.",0
1,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL,0
3,"Bought this as a gift for my grandfather. Although it is good quality and the color is true to the picture, it did fit him way too big on his head despite ordering a small size. Luckily Amazon sells hat size reducers separately for a cheap price and was able to use it to make it fit just right.",0
3,This is super cute but it keeps opening and falling on the floor. It also has a piece of flower on the wooden side. I'm going to keep it because I like it and e6000 glue it closed. Hopefully that fixes the issue.,0
3,It's nice made but if you have dark color frame that you probably want to stay away from this pinkish clip on sunglasses.,0
2,"I was disappointed. This is  very nice outfit I bought for my 13 yr old son who is a little husky.  He has broad shoulders and a non-flat derriere. Unfortunately the pants portions did not go past his thighs. The shirt looked nice but fitted, not loose and comfortable. I bought about 2 sizes up(16/18) thinking it should be perfect for my 13 year old but unfortunately I was mistaken. Nevertheless it is a beautiful outfit just beautiful with sizing.",0
3,Not easy to open; actually looks nicer in photo. Nice compact size.,0
5,"I thought that this dress was really great for how much I spent on it. The material felt for comfortable and was not itchy at all. I was able to wash it once and it still kept its color and appeared like it will last for a while. My gf really liked the belt, because it felt like a little something extra added to the dress. Definitely worth the purchase. Love the design too.",1
5,Great hat.,1
1,"Not at all what the picture makes it out to be, order a size or 2 up if you really want them, the lace was ripped when it arrived, I returned them and didn't bother ordering new ones cause they just didn't feel comfortable and weren't what I wanted",0
4,Nice product for the price. They work quite well and are very pretty.,1
4,Great quality and fits like a true small.,1
1,Cheapest and ugliest suspenders. Would never wear.,0
4,"Really a nice pair of glasses for the price you pay. The frames were big, maybe too big for some (it was for me), but the measurements are listed in description if you're up to measuring. As listed in the description they come with a hard-backed faux-leather snap-button case, lined with a velveteen fabric, a drawstring bag to carry to the glasses, and a small lens cloth. All the items were packed in a match-box sized box.<br /><br />The polarization worked,though I did not test it extensively.The lenses were not especially dark, but other glasses in this price range fare about the same, and it's more than enough for driving and/or fishing. I ordered the green lens/gold frame, the colors were very vibrant, the gold on the frame was especially bright. I was hoping for something a bit more subtle, but I recognize that some may prefer a brighter gold. I ended up returning the glasses, as they were too big for my face and slipped off my nose constantly, but I would recommend the glasses to anyone who was hesitant about buying. Don't expect Ray Bans quality, but for only $20 you get a pretty good deal.",1
1,Got XL they fit extremely comfortably around the waist but they fit saggy and loose around my legs and groing. I have very large tight and underware has no elasticity.,0
1,Words are faded and can barely read it,0
3,I am an XL through and through. I ordered a 2XL because it said heathered.  Still super tight and short. Wasn't a fan. I immediately returned it and have yet to receive my refund. 7 days and counting.,0
3,I was so excited about this bikini but when I received it I was disappointed. The bottoms do not fit at all I would say they are xs instead of a medium. I actually wear a small but ordered a size up and they still don't come close to fitting. The top on the other hand is the bomb.com. I actually want to purchase another top only because it fits so well. For the price I'll keep the suit just wish I now wouldn't have to go buy bottoms new bottoms though.,0
5,Got these for a little girl that loves all things sparkly.,1
5,She loves it,1
5,Very pretty and elegant.  Normal size fits and it‚Äôs stretcht and comfortable!,1
5,I really like is what I expected,1
1,This product uses Velcro to keep the lighting unit in its place but does not use any type of slot to mount the unit within the encasement so when you make a fist the front of the light unit pops up above the rim of the mounting ring on the glove it self.  I was planning on using these on my motorcycle but am afraid at high speeds the air will catch the light unit and rip it off.  Also ordered size (L) based on the size chart provided and wish I had ordered a medium instead since the material stretches with use and gets baggy in my palm.<br /><br />Will update this review if I hear from customer service and let you know how my experience with them goes but at this point I would not recommend this product.,0
4,"This worked a dream as a Halloween costume for my 9yo. She loved the pretty princess like dress, the rainbow wings, the be-horned headband. Not easy to clean, as many parts could be obviously damaged via regular washing and drying. We hand wash and hang dry and will keep for as long as possible to play dress up! Overall good product.",1
1,No threading to keep the balls on... WASTE OF MONEY! Would give no stars if I could!,0
5,"Wonderful feel, great color! I got the red and it is cheerful and perfect for summer. This is a nice leather product. I thought the lining might bother me since it isn‚Äôt attached all the way around, but it‚Äôs not a big deal. The handles are perfect for me and I love the slouchy look. It‚Äôs less proper than some other bags but I like that style. Great buy!",1
5,Absolutely gorgeous,1
3,Great idea and product,0
2,Stretch too much. Catch on the floor. Find them dangerous.especially for the elderly.,0
5,"If you have a big head, these are the glasses for you. These are the first sunglasses that have ever fit me. I am buying 2 more pairs right now.",1
1,This fits awkwardly too big and the fabric feels cheap. Very very very disappointed:(,0
1,"The color and appearance is beautiful, but chain is very fragile, it broke within 2 weeks.",0
1,Was torn upon receipt but was too close to Halloween to say anything because I needed it.,0
1,After a wash the pajama shrunk 3 sizes and my kid cannot wear it.,0
5,"I bought them to use at the time of driving, they were very comfortable and help a lot to reduce the incidence of radiation, they also give you style.",1
5,"Looks great. I was worried buying a dress on Amazon, but I love it. The quality is good and it fits great. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it.",1
5,"I love this bracelet, it‚Äôs so cute and handy!",1
5,"Great quality shirt, not thin and cheap would buy again!",1
2,"It was great while they lasted. Before the end of first use, 2 fingers popped off.",0
1,Horribly thin material with no underwire,0
1,"I was so excited that I got my dress in today. My measurements are 5ft 1 ,,, 36,,28,36  I weigh 129 lbs  ordered a large. Description says its stretchy. It does feels like it when u go to put it on. It is tight under the arms.. if u bend over it shows your private areas., the dress also came w white markings all over the outside of the back of the bottom of the dress,, and inside of armpit area. Look n smell like deodorant,  stitching is visible that it looks uneven throughout dress, and looks like it is coming undone. I do absolutely love the design of the dress. Just to many prob w it for me to keep. A size large is just way to tight for my measurements of 5ft 1,,,, 36,28,36,,, I recommend getting a size up for anyone.  I normally wear size 7-8 or medium or large depending on material. N still this dress is way to tight. I wear all my dress out the same material as this one here. And they all fit perfectly,  I love sexy dresses that show curves. . I am disappointed with the issues I have w it.  I really wanted this dress. I guess you get what you pay for.. I am thinking of ordering a size up , I have to really think about it.",0
5,I love the belt and ordered another. Buckle closes nicely. Stays flush. So different. Lots of complements.,1
5,The craftmenship of the bracket is outstanding. It is very beautiful.,1
5,Good,1
3,"Before ordering, we read the reviews. We ordered a size larger than normal and happy we did. An XL fit like a L. The fabric has a decent 'hand' but it does pick up an inordinate amount of lint and dust. The zipper sometimes opens from the bottom up expectedly. Bottom line, great jacket for the price. Comfortable and perfect for mild Texas winters.",0
1,"The orange dress I ordered is completely see through, nothing like the quality in the picture . you can see my nipples clearly which is why I can‚Äôt even attach a pic to show . It‚Äôs cheaply made it‚Äôs completely sheer and a waste of money",0
5,"This was a gift for my Mom, she loved it!",1
2,"Eh, thought I would use them to work out and results are completely trash.. they're extremely loose on the top and it doesn't hug well. definitely using them to wear around the house and to bed",0
1,I bought this925 Sterling Silver Peace LoveSign Round bracelet for my granddaughter because she and I share the Peace. It arrived and what a piece of junk! It bends like carnival jewelry. That much money I expected quality at least a little. It bent and it didn't take any pressure. I knew I wouldn't get anything better so I threw it away. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and this was the worst piece of jewelry. I have bought other jewelry by Chuuuuvora and it's always been good but not this time!,0
5,"Great band, easy to install and is comfortable to wear 24/7.  Only take it off to shower or charge my Instict.",1
5,I sent for  a set for myself and now waiting for another set for my Granddaughter  They are VERY nice...,1
2,"Not great quality, they look cheap....however, they were inexpensive, so it depends on what you're looking for. If you're going for the leather look, these aren't what you want. They just look like a very shiny legging. They fit great though, pretty flattering.",0
1,"This belt is awful.  Even though the belt is leather, the piece that holds the buckle to the belt is not and mine has almost ripped all the way across even though I've only had it for 4 days.  Do not buy if you need a belt tight enough to hold up your pants.",0
2,A little large,0
2,Ordered an extra large. It‚Äôs soooo small it looks like it‚Äôs for a child.,0
1,NO NO NO,0
3,Paper thin material. I use it as a night gown.,0
1,"Put one on my ear and gently squeezed to tighten and it broke right in half. Cheap, fake, waste of money.",0
5,"Bought for my son and he loves this. It is small, but very cute and seems durable as I've found it all over the bedroom when not in use.",1
5,Fits so good and feels so soft,1
1,"Too short, material not the best quality",0
1,"These rings looks cheap. I definitely wouldn't buy this again. In fact, I'd probably throw these away since I'd never wear them.",0
5,"I purchase this for my Granddaughter,....she just Loves it,...the terrycloth is nice and thick,....her brothers have used it a few times,....So I will be buying two more by Christmas!  PS,....This would be great for the beach & poolside too.",1
5,Love this watch.  It resembles a Tokyo Bay watch I had several years ago that I loved.  This one is much less expensive.,1
2,I love the product but it took me 6 months to get it.,0
1,"These are advertised for children but are too large. Seller am only offered a 15% refund and required me to show photo proof that they were too big for my MINOR child. I believe while these ‚Äúship from the USA‚Äù, they are not made here and the seller is most certainly abroad. Creepy and dishonest.",0
5,"cute little shirt. the is good quality, not thin at all. I am very pleased",1
2,Dress fit very large.  The back was stretched out real loose and was see-through.  Just not very good quality.,0
5,all 20 were there and it is a good price. i recommend this to anyone that has a tongue piercing,1
5,Love it just what I was looking for,1
1,"Runs big. I bought ""S"" and it was too big for me... I am 132lbs",0
3,Very small and tight. Fits more like a child‚Äôs than an adult.,0

5,"I got this for a gift. The person that received it two weeks ago, has yet to take it off. It‚Äôs perfect and delicate compared to other ones with the size",1
5,I got these for my husband for Christmas. He said they are the best slippers I ever got him.,1
3,It's a cute piece but I didn't like the closure.,0
5,Sooooooo cute!! I love these glasses. they're sturdy and very well put together. I got so many compliments on these glasses. I recommend them.,1
5,Holds two sets of chess pieces plus two extra queens with no problem.,1
3,I should have listened to everyone's review on this for them being too big! They are huge. I would say at least 2 sizes bigger then needed if not more...Otherwise they are ok..shiny...I am returning them.,0
2,"Quality is in line with the price (not amazing, but I didn‚Äôt expect amazing for the price).  Very small though.  I ordered a medium (my regular size) based on previous reviews, and took it out of the bag and immediately knew there was no way it would fit :/",0
1,It doesn‚Äôt hang off the shoulder as stated: the width of the neck part is size of regular shirt,0
5,Love it I look lovely in it.,1
5,Super cute and amazing quality! I love this belly ring so much! I highly recommend!,1
4,"I bought these dress as a prime day deal in my normal size and it was too big. I am 5'1, 110lbs and bought an XS. It was too big around and way too long. I read some other reviews saying that it shrinks so I thought I'd take a chance and it did! It now looks great with wedges (still too long for flats) and fits much better around. I will say the tie is weird since it's not real and could probably be removed but I do love the style and pattern so I will keep wearing it!",1
1,No megusta,0
5,Perfect for making baby warm. I love this hat,1
4,"The earrings are not as enormous as they look in the advert. They are a manageable size for a day or evening out. I would not try to wear them during a 8 hour work day. They are not super heavy, but weighty enough that after 3 hours you will be feeling them. They look a little 60‚Äôs mod which is cool with me.  Yes, the pearls look fake but who would expect them to be real? They come in a velvety box which is nice. Also included was a gift elastic hair tie and the option of rubber or metal earring backs. There is also a wet wipe which you will need because the little box sheds a lot of fibers.",1
5,love,1
5,FIT MY GRANDDAUGHTER PERFECTLY.  SHE LOVES THE NEW CLOTHES.,1
5,cooool,1
3,The fit was ok. Leg opening is big and everything falls out by the end of day. They feel good on a hot day but I have to take them off as soon as I get home because of the leg opening is stretched out.,0

4,I love the colors and they fit the phone. I got them for gifts to family and friends. Also I can change them to match my outfits,1
3,"When I received this band, I liked it until I put it on my wrist. The feel of the band is premium and has a nice weight to it. I did not feel like a cheap knockoff, but the magnets were not strong enough to hold firm for longer than a minute when I put it on. It kept falling off. This has the potential of being a worthy band with stronger magnets.",0

5,"I bought this dress for a swimsuit cover up. Worked great!  I'm 5'2&#34; and it just brushed the ground in the back. I'm not saying its fancy and I don't know if it's sewn well, but its meeting all my needs plus some. I decided to wearing with a sports bra as just a casual summer dress as well.",1
3,"I was expecting these to wow me.  I can walk in high heels like I was born with them on.  Putting these boots on was not as bad, but if I had to walk in them longer than a few minutes, like a baby calf.  It didn‚Äôt have any ankle support and was loose around the area so that there wasn‚Äôt much stability around the heel.  It fit all the way up over my knee and did look uh-mazing.  If it‚Äôs only going to be worn for a couple minutes of walking TOTAL, then I‚Äôd get them again, but other than that, I‚Äôd go for leather boots...pass on suede.",0
1,Looks nice runs small,0

3,They were smaller than I thought they were going to be but they were still cute luckly I have a second hole and used it for that,0
3,Not sure these are the original Lokai beads..I have one from the Lokai company and there's definitely a difference--but for the price it's a good knockoff.,0
3,Did not flatter my figure and very little tummy control,0
5,I bought these earring because I wanted some smaller hoops to wear. These are great! They are very light. My skin isn‚Äôt sensitive to the metal. I love them,1
5,"I bought this as a gift and it fit him perfectly. He is over 6"" with broad shoulders and slenderish build. Very beautifully made, soft and the leather buttons and pockets make it even better!",1
4,Great for the price,1
5,Really nice strap for the money!  I would purchase this again.,1
3,"Worth the price, sparkling and pretty, nice size, would be good as a gift or just a special inexpensive reward to self.",0
1,"Colors look funny dont match, not happy with it :(",0
1,"The shirt had multiple areas where the stitching came apart and a hole was created. The material is nice, I really loved the shirt but it developed a hole in the side after one time wearing. The stitching completely came apart.",0
5,Gift to a 3 year old little girl and she loved them!,1
1,Too small. Not much direction on how to mold. The molding process did not work. Completely ruined the grills.,0
5,My daughter loves these chained bracelet designs. I like how they look & how they make her wrist look pretty.,1
2,Pretty dress and design but it seems to be made for a child. I ordered a large and it looks like it would fit a 8 year old child. Disappointed.,0
5,Excellent product second time purchasing these can last a lifetime!,1
5,"These definitely run small, but its an awesome sweater. Im a 5'9"" 150lb athletic female and its a comfortable kind of loose on me (between being form fitting and super baggy). I also love the graphics!",1
5,"Material is nice, fits well....made very nice, worth the money",1
5,My granddaughter loves it! She feels like a real baker.,1
1,Too big and I dont have a large head.,0
2,"Listen to the reviews that point out the inconsistencies in the products! I purchased an XL and the fit is accurate, haven't washed yet though. My experience:<br /><br />Seams don't line up as mentioned in reviews (see pic)<br />Colors are WAY OFF as mentioned in reviews - I purchased what I thought would be a dusty rose w/leopard....not even close. More of a baby pink which I will never wear (see pic)<br />Same for the 'Charlie Brown' zig-zag shirt - colors are WAY OFF.<br />The blue leopard has an accurate color depiction. However, no one has mentioned that the leopard stripe is basically a plasticy iron on patch (which both smells and makes a sound when you run your nails over it) that has a life of its own. The patch is wide and doesn't sit very well and bunches up at your armpits. I'm hopeful this will change once it's washed. (See pic)<br /><br />I didn't have crazy high hopes for these shirts,  but am still bummed at how 'off' they truly are from the pics.",0
4,"Fits comfortably. As described. I am a satisfied buyer.<br />I am 5'4, 185 lbs. These are extremely comfortable and are great for office attire. I bought these is various colors because they are worth the price.",1
5,Cute! Looks great on me.,1
5,"I got black first and wear a strappy workout bra under it, it covers your rear. So now I just ordered the white and gray. Great material, best to wash on delicate cold, literally take it out and shake it, then put it in a hanger somewhere and let it dry.",1
5,Super cute and stylish! I ordered a medium.,1
1,No fit really good,0
5,Pretty rugged backpack.,1
5,Overall good product,1
3,"This is of great quality. My boyfriend is a diehard Cowboys fan and he loved the look of it. However, if you are going to put more than a few dollars in it, you will be disappointed. It doesn't expand very easily at all.",0
5,"I have many watches. Luminox is always my go to outdoor camping, Hiking, Hunting, anything outdoors. Fantastic watch!!",1
5,Good boots. I just hope the zipper can hold for a long time.,1
1,Horrible product! Not a sweatshirt! Should have read the reviews! Tag ripped off. Should not allow to sell on Amazon!,0
5,I LOVE this purse. The quality is luxurious.  It is very well made and looks like a $300 purse. I especially love the size. It is roomy yet not bulky and looks nice whether you put a lot or a little in it. The lining and organizational pockets inside are perfect.,1
5,Great pair of plugs so far. It was a little tricky at first to get the back to screw on and they don't screw on very far but they are on there pretty solid. Not afraid of them falling off at all.,1
1,"This product was very uncomfortable to wear. It is rigid and there is no cushion along the head. It seems to run small; the strap was barely long enough to fit my head, and I'm a small man. It was so uncomfortable that I tore it off after just a couple minutes. Definitely would not recommend it.",0
4,Happy with the size and shipped in a timely manor,1
2,I RETURNED FOR REFUND VERY SMALL<br />LIKE FOR A CHILD,0
2,Comfortable but does not ware well.  I wear it in the house.,0
3,Problems with the zipper.  It pulls away when trying to close,0
3,Very nice! Just not wide enough as advertised.,0
4,very cute with leggings,1
1,Too big and cheap material,0
2,"The setting was beautiful,but not knowing much about size the Pearl seemed way to big. Nice if it could of been smaller.",0
3,chain was ALOT longer then expected,0
3,"These fit great. They helped ease the pain on my ischiums, However, the pad does not extend far enough forward to the area that rides the horn. In fact, it appears that there is an area that was supposed to have padding there, but was not put in when sewn.",0
5,Keeps me warm on runs in the upper 20s and lower 30s. Too warm for high 30s and up. Thumb holes are nice. Hood is nice when needed.,1
1,These type of shoes are st the stores for $40-70. That being said the $17 was very intriguing. Ordered for both my first grade boys. They were so excited. Then neither of them worked. Charged them because I thought maybe they weren‚Äôt charged regardless of others reviews. Had to send both pairs back. One wouldn‚Äôt charge at all and only one shoe worked on the other pair. I do wish these type of shoes would only light up when they are stepped on like other kid shoes but the lights are just either on or off making the soles so stiff they can‚Äôt run or really play. Definitely just for show. Despite all of that I‚Äôm sure you guys can imagine that two first grade upset boys I ended up offing ‚Äúthe last pair‚Äù just to see if those work but still went to the store and spent $90 for two pairs that actually work with ease and are better made and more comfortable. Don‚Äôt waste ur money or time.,0
5,"Love them, they're cute, comfortable, wash well and a good fit. What's not to love?",1
1,"Dont buy it. Does not stay in place, does not fit right.",0
5,Product is as advertised. Packaging and presentation is good.,1
5,This patch was easy to put on and looks great!  It got here in perfect quality no messed up threads .,1
3,The shorts portion was a bit tight on my thighs.,0
1,The gold plated became tarnished within a week of wearing and then it broke the week after that. Cute but don‚Äôt bother,0
5,I love this gold band on my wrist watch it looks rich and elegant I really recommend it,1
2,"Disappointed, after the first used the thread begin to come out‚Ä¶ because of the price I paid, I was expecting something better.",0
2,Nice dress<br />To small<br />Hard to return<br />Had to go to ups office to return<br />And get mailing label to return,0
2,"These are WAY too big. They should be described as toddler socks, not baby.",0
5,great quality for the price. everyone was impressed and some even thought it was real from a distance. i wore it off the shoulders over a french style dress and it was perfect.,1
1,"I purchased 5 of theses for Christmas gifts, what an embarrassment -One daughter-in-law was helping with dinner when the bracelet broke and fell to the floor. We fixed the link, but my son took it to the jewelers and had it repaired. The third time it broke i needed to send it back. I sent back two and got credit for one.",0
1,Wrong color and size,0
3,Sizing is off. Ordered a size up an was still too small.,0
1,I liked the feel of the bra but wasn't my size at all. Smaller than truly is.,0
5,"Perfect for my sweaty feet, confortable",1
4,My Sunday School class loves to act out Biblical stories.  I needed a king‚Äôs costume & I‚Äôm completely satisfied.  It arrived on time.,1
2,While the watch itself looks even better than it does in the picture I had two separate issues when I received it. The first issue was that when I received the watch a pin had already fallen out leaving the wristband broken. I was able to easily re-insert the pin however the wrist band felt like it was sized for a child. I am a larger man but have smaller wrists and was surprised when the clasp wouldn't close. Unfortunately I had to return it.,0
5,Awesome product,1
5,Nice,1
5,"Looks great, it is for my daughter who is due end of the month. Looks like it will fit well.",1
1,"Too small, did not match what I ordered.",0
5,This was to replace my mother's wallet that she broke a zipper on. She seems to like it. It's nice that it's big enough for one of these modern mobile phones.,1
4,"As a fan of the Mortal Instruments series, I was so excited when I saw this. It came in the mail (and only took two weeks! Not bad for coming from overseas!) and I fell in love. The overall quality of it is great. There isn't any chipped paint or broken pieces. The only thing I would change about it is that the head and tail is very obviously glued to the main body. There is glue coming out of the holes where the head and tail were inserted. It's not super noticeable from afar but it's there. When I was comparing the picture of the bracelet on the Amazon website and my bracelet, I noticed that the head on mine had a tongue sticking out of the mouth, whereas the picture on the website did not. One other thing I noticed is that the product description says there is a magnet behind the head, allowing it to attach to itself. This was not the case with the bracelet I received. I don't view these as negative aspects, because the bracelet looks great and works well as it is, but I found it strange and felt the need to disclose. The bracelet is really one long piece of flexible metal, allowing you to wear it a number of ways. It looks great on my arm, but you could also wear it as a necklace if you're so inclined.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase and would recommend it to any fan of the Mortal Instruments series!<br /><br />I received a discount on this amazing piece of jewelry in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions expressed here are my own.",1
5,I love the fit and colors. The sizing chart is accurate and I will be buying more!,1
1,I ordered an XXL because I have large breasts. The material in front is so small. I had muffin boob. Not enough coverage at all.  Disappointed.,0
5,Comfy and thick,1
5,"This sweater is lovely.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  It is a very nice weight, not too heavy or light.",1
4,Some zippers stick a little so it's annoying but otherwise nice with pockets. I take a diaper wipes and snack. So doubles as a mini diaper bag for me!,1
2,Beautiful but not surgical steel. Turned my ear green after one day and my ear really started to hurt. I was only able to wear it for about a week before I had to take it out and get new jewelry.,0
1,I wore this bracelet once and the elastic broke. Extremely disappointed with this purchase.,0
5,"Pretty decent elastic belt. I‚Äôm far and it fits me alright. Not too loose, not too tight. I like it.",1
5,I liked the comfort of the band and the sleek look. It fit my Seiko with a little adjusting by my jeweler.,1
5,"Well fitting, very good support and sexy brassiere",1
5,Excelente,1
3,It‚Äôs an average short running shoe. Got fooled by the brand name. But what else can you expect from a deal,0
1,Very disappointed. One of the roses fell off the first time my daughter put it on. My daughter bought the headband with her gift card. Returning it would cost more than what she paid for it.,0
5,"I like the length.  Fit is excellent and it washes well and did not shrink.  Sleeve length is perfect, just above the elbow.  The seams are nicely finished.<br /><br />Con: Washed a second time and it did shrink about 1 1/2 in I believe it was due to the water temp and maybe the dryer .",1
5,I love this dress. It makes me so happy to wear it for formal occasions.,1
3,After reading the other reviews I purchased this adorable bracelet. It is genuinely cute- but cheap cheap cheap!! You can see seams in the metal pieces. Dollar store quality.,0
5,This was a much appreciated gift for a nursing grad.,1
4,"Great quality and look, small to size.",1
1,"My glasses came in today and already broken, really? I need a refund for this.",0
2,Limited sizes,0
1,"This hat is heavy. I mean really, really heavy. First the hat was not knit like a traditional hat with a smaller crown that slowly gets larger. Instead it is knit as a tube that is then sewn closed at the top. Bunching up the extra fabric at the top create a top heavy, dense hat that stands upright like a cone. The pom-pom, while beautiful is also very heavy ‚Äì¬†there is a solid mass in the middle with the fur covering it. The pom-pom is removable but the hat would still be top heavy and stiff.",0
1,This was an interesting order...not at all like the picture.  Instead of bright blue it was an odd teal like color with a purple zipper.  I had ordered a large - the inside tag said extra large while the scan tag was a large.  It definitely was an extra large.  Bummer!,0
3,I like this L but it doesnt fix my  Bracelet and that was the point of me getting it so I had to put it on my chain  .the whole on this just dont go on the bracelet  wish i was  Disappointed cause that was the point of getting it,0
5,My daughter is 6 months old and has a much larger than average head. These headbands fit her wonderfully with out being too tight. They will be able to fit her for quite some time. The headbands themselves are of great quality. Vibrant colors and well made. So glad I decided on these over others that were offered.,1
5,Softer than expected. Really comfy.,1
5,I absolutely LOVE these earrings! They are lightweight and compliment any outfit. BUY THEM!,1
1,"The gloves reeked like burnt plastic as soon as I opened the package. Even after several washes, I still can't get the smell out.",0
4,Cute!,1
3,Cute pattern and the bag itself looks sturdy but the handle drop is NOT 10‚Äù. It‚Äôs 8‚Äù at best. Very disappointing! I can‚Äôt place this tote over my shoulder and that will drive me crazy. If it had long enough handles I would keep this bag. Am returning it tomorrow.,0
3,I don't care for them,0
5,"Too big even though I went with the measurements. I am a size 12 (US) and my waste is 39"" and it was too big. Pant waist says 32-36. I think XL would have worked better<br /><br />From seller: Size:XXL----Waist:82-92cm/32.3-36.2""----Hip:146cm/57.5""----Inseam:63cm/24.8""----Length :98cm/38.6""",1
5,Worked awesome,1
3,Runs small. I thought they would be easy slip on slippers for my two year old. She struggled keeping them on and seemed to be uncomfortable.,0
4,"Thought it was going to be more of a summer dress but ended up being a nighty because of the material. It's super comfy, but a little too short.",1
1,Fabric,0
5,Easy to replace the old one,1
5,Super soft and stretchy!,1
4,"Im about 160 and 5'4. I read the comments on this dress and went for 3 sizes up and the dress is a bit big. I should've ordered a large, but it doesn't look terrible a bit loose but still very cute.",1
5,These are great. Very soft and comfortable to wear. The pockets are great. I would order these in every color.,1
3,The quality was okay but the size was very small.,0
5,Love the fabric. It's soft and comfy and  a little stretchy. Bought the white in a large and I want it in every color now.,1
1,I was so excited to find this necklace at such an affordable price but was highly disappointed when they came in because of how short the chain was. It barely clasped and therefore was literally choking me when I would speak.,0
1,"I liked the look, and I received compliments the one and only time I wore it.  The beads were a little itchy against my skin.  The clasp broke the second time that I attempted to wear it.  The earrings have never been worn.",0
4,"Nice color. Fits well. Beadwork could be better, they came undone.",1
2,"The ivory dress is WHITE. I had ordered this for my sister-in-law‚Äôs wedding, and realized too late that it is the wrong color!",0
5,They were a great fit and very fashionable everyone loved them,1
4,We ordered a size up and the legs were still snug but the torso part was too long and caused sagging. It's well made but the fit isn't the best. It suited our purpose.,1
2,Not chiffon material,0
5,These Castelli toe covers are far superior to other brands I've tried. They slip on easily and the neoprene keeps the wind out and the warmth in.  Have used them on a few rides and they are holding up well so far.,1
3,Pictures very deceiving. Tried it on and felt very thin and cheaply made,0
2,Thin. No thread seam on top or bottom of mask bandana.,0
3,Fits as expected. Looks like the picture I would purchase again I ordered the largest one and it fit both my girls who are a chunky ages 7 and 10,0
1,I was very excited about this bargain. However the bras run very small. I had to sent them back. I'm very disappointed.,0
4,I think these are really great sports bras for the price.  I don't like the padding but there is a place on the side that you can take it out if you want.  I would purchase these sports bras again.,1
5,"I received my necklace set in a very timely manner.  I love the set! When  I  ordered it,  I  ordered a  second pair of earrings  because I  thought these might be small, but they are a good size.  One of the stones was missing when I took it out of the bag. It was in the bottom of the bag, and  a little super glue fixed it.",1
1,No good,0
4,Colors are somewhat faded<br />But I love these pants.,1
5,Perfect fit - lovely  drape and softness even after wash. Not a thing stiff about this garment and very flattering !,1
1,"You spelled ""astronomy"" wrong... oops! Hope you didn't print too many of those bad boys.",0
2,Hats fit great but came in different colors- rather than a red and tan hat I got a beige and tan one!- lame!,0
5,Wonderful ring,1
4,Love these shorts,1
5,The beautiful color,1
4,Super cute coat.  A bit snug around the bust.  Be sure to read the materials in the description and not in the title.  There is NO WOOL in this product but it is priced accordingly.,1
2,Cute but not sized correctly. I have large thighs so even with a garter belt they don‚Äôt stay up well. It‚Äôs a good design and material but runs small,0
3,Size runs on the small end. Battery life really short like 2 hrs of music on a full battery.,0
3,Fell apart after I tried it on. I knew the price was low and you get what you pay for but I was expecting it to last longer than taking out of the package and trying it on.,0
5,Beautiful! The quality surpassed my expectations for the xmas deal they were offering! My only regret is I didn't get a pair for me!,1
3,"I normally wear a medium so I ordered a large but this fits like a much smaller size or fitted base layer. I‚Äôm keeping it, but recommend ordering a size up.",0
5,"Adorable. Nicely made, quality fabric, soft. Would buy again",1
5,Love the comfortable feel on my skin. I wear a back brace under my shirt. I use this item to<br />avoid the rough feeling of the brace on my waist. It‚Äôs very light and ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù..,1
5,So cute and so well made!,1
5,"My wife wear US medium, and the size M fits her well. The fabrics is quite comfortable. She likes the cutting and design very much. It is a good casual dress. We will buy more.",1
5,This dress is so perfect.,1
4,"Fit as expected. I feel it‚Äôs very soft and little transparency so can‚Äôt tuck in the shirt.. the pocket line show clearly, can‚Äôt even keep the mobile phone in side the pocket..",1
3,Product is made of decent material. Super cute. My only reason for rating it 3 instead of 5 is because they sent me the wrong size. So I can't really give an accurate review of something that doesn't fit me.,0
1,"This looks like a quality mask but in reality it is a flimsy piece of material with ear loop cutouts. It will no doubt be stretched out after only a few wears. The only seam on it is the front where the two sides come together. Everything else is just cut, raw-edge fabric. The picture makes it look like a well-made mask. And for the price, that is what one might expect. Disappointing.",0
1,Terrible!!! Did not even go on nipple üòÇ,0
1,"Cheaply made. Will probably give as a gift to my 1 year old grandson. Not for a 6 foot 2, 290 pound man what so ever. Not worth the price simply because of the popularity of the Mandalorian series.",0
5,"Love these sun glasses! I wear them all the time, the size is perfect and the quality is great. I got the brown colored ones and love the tint",1
4,"This set of a Multi Strand Layered Necklace and Earring is made of various colors of beading on clear line for the necklace and metal wire for the earrings. This is very attractive from a design and color standpoint, and would be a lovely addition to outfits for various occasions from casual to dressy. This set appears to be well made, with clean wiring and finishes. Overall, this is a very pretty look.",1
5,I love it!! want in others colors!!,1
4,I'm only subtracting one star because they do kind of hang down since the stud isn't in the middle.,1
3,It's cool but not as well polarized as expected. It'll block sun rays a little bit but at as much as some other glasses I've had.,0
5,I get a lot of compliments on the shirt.,1
5,I ordered this after several hundred dollars in purchases were made by someone swiping my handbag and getting access to our company card. Very pleased with the quality & love the red color. It is not bulky and fits perfectly in the clutch I use often!,1
3,"VERY CUTE SOFT AND FUN, ITS JUST TOO SMALL",0
4,"Very breathable,  some concerns about the seams/stitching in some areas.  Like all things quickly mass produced and lack of attention to detail when beginning and ending a seam or from an engender should always be very reinforced for quality and longevity in the washing processe,  which let's face it, it's a biking jersey/shirt, it's gonna need many the washing. Looks fantastic tho. Love e the design and minimalist fox logoing.",1
5,"Bought as a gift and it was well received! I asked the recipient about the review and she said, &#34;The chain could be longer. The hedgehog was very beautiful and true to life. The burnish color was pretty. And the crystals set the whole thing off.&#34; As far as the chain being longer, that's probably on me, her personal preference. She loves it though.",1
5,More beautiful than I expected and a perfect fit. I absolutely love them.,1
5,I love this outfit. I've had so many compliments about. The only thing is that you will have to go up in size.,1
5,"Ordered for my son ,but it looked to girly on his feet but true to size .",1
3,"I would have loved to have taken photos in it, but there was no wearing it. At 5‚Äô1 and 220 I can comfortably wear a 2X that states 20-22 US but this was a different story. I would love to exchange it but this was the only style that had the 20-22 size. Luckily I have a great friend who can sew and we will be adding stretchy panels to each side so I can wear it. I will update once the alterations are done! Thank goodness the frantic can take it!",0
5,"...but does runs a bit bigger. Im usually XL and I bought a L, fits a bit loose but I like it. I could probably be ok with M. I am 5'7 and the dress is all the way to my ankles.",1
3,They are ok for the price,0
5,"This is a VERY nice flannel gown for the price.  I ordered two.  The flannel is thin but still quite warm.  The color (I bought pink) is pretty and it's very comfortable.  I recommend washing before wearing; they had a &#34;dye&#34; smell to them and washing removed the dye odor.  I washed them in cold water, delicate cycle, gentle detergent and dried on low.  I recommend sizing up as the nightgown does shrink a bit in the wash even using cold water as is common for 100% cotton clothing.  On me (I'm 5' 7&#34;) after washing/drying it hits about the middle of my calf.  I sized up two sizes as I like my sleepwear loose, but 1 size up would be good if you just want it to fit comfortably and not worry about shrinkage from laundering.",1
1,Fit right,0
3,Disappointed in quality,0
1,Doesn't look like it's picture,0
1,"First 300% is 3X. but you have to understand focal length. It is called physics. You are getting a cheap pair of magnifying glasses with almost zero focal length. The only thing they would be good for is finding the focal length and use them to burn ants or bugs by focusing the sun on them. They have not the focal length to see anything clearly it would be like holding two magnifying glasses up to your eyes. Just looking at the physical aspects should tell you they won't work. It is optical physics, they can't work as advertised.<br /><br />This is a shameful product playing on the ignorance of people.",0
5,This sweater is great. It‚Äôs lightweight a very warm. I love the pocket. The hood is very convenient. It‚Äôs been washed several times and is holding out perfectly.,1
1,Not a good shape for me. Didn‚Äôt like the fabric,0
5,"These are really nice glasses for the price.  They are comfortable and snug enough that they don't constantly slip off my head.  They feel solidly built and they were packaged really well...none of them arrived with any scratches or defects or warps.  Instead of a case, each pair arrived inside a small, pull-string bag that doubles as a lens cleaning cloth.  Nice!  And they were all nestled inside a box that contained cleaning instructions as well as all the contact information for the company...a very nice touch.  I noticed right away that the contact email was a direct email...not just some generic customer service address.  And sure enough, I received a personalized email from the person named in that email days later just to check and be sure I was happy with the order.  I would definitely order from them again!",1
1,"Received the wrong print, not that it really matters. Material is uncomfortable and fit is horribly unflattering. Pockets bulge out. I‚Äôll probably just end up sleeping in it or something.",0
2,"The links were easy to move, but the links pinches your arm hairs, and it eventually fell apart one day while I was walking.",0
1,VERY awkward weird unflattering fit and cheap looking. Basically a waste of my money,0
1,looks nice fits my wife but no me...,0
2,xl size is very small,0
3,Nice dress but somehow large on my burst.,0
1,The hats arrived used. They were each poorly wrapped in clear plastic bags that were unsealed. I spotted hair on both hats. Gross.,0
2,Sizing is way off order up 3 sizes larger if you plan on fitting it,0
2,Nice look ...  but  very big  size  not,0
4,Very impressed.  The sound quality is good not overly load but load enough that I don't have it on full volume all the time.  Very warm hat. To warm to wear inside. Will be ordering more of them.,1
5,I used to purchase these from Costco but have been unable to find them recently.  They are so comfy and I love the material.  The fit is amazing and they stay in place.,1
3,"This is a cute skirt with a nice amount of flare.  I'm 5'6"", 129 pounds and the medium fits good.  I did not notice when I ordered it that one of the pockets is upside down.  I guess that is handy for tennis but not for running as I like to keep my phone in one pocket and chapstick in the other.  Unfortunately I would not order another one of these as I need two right side up pockets.",0
1,I like the design on the band. But after just 2 weeks the flag covering has started coming off!! My husband gave it to me for a Christmas present and I‚Äôm sad that he spent his money on something that is defective,0
4,"This bag is really soft and is really lightweight! It's not as big as imagined but does hold a notebook or three. There is only one inside zipper pocket that is not large enough to hold a can of mints, but smaller items. It does zip.",1
5,"So cute, I had to buy another for a friend when she saw me wearing mine.",1
1,Too small,0
1,"This was so small I didn‚Äôt even attempt to put it on. I‚Äôm usually a small or medium and ordered the large to be safe. The second I took it out I thought I was sent the wrong size. Nope. It said large. Measured the waist and the large was a 26.5. Threads hanging all over the skirt. It was just a mess. Returning ASAP.  5‚Äô7, 150lbs, 4-6 in jeans.",0
1,Didn't like it at all.<br />Deceiving in picture  and truly a horrible plactic shinning  tarp with no define lines to fit like a jacket color wads off as well.  Pretty sure it was a wish merchandise.,0
5,Good quality and cute top,1
2,"Not true to size, it's much bigger. And the red came looking like pink. Will be returning.",0
5,These are great to have as a preschool teacher!,1
4,Good price for the box,1
1,I normally wear 2x and I want a bra that fit well on the sides and back. I ordered a 3x thinking I‚Äôd rather adjust it smaller than have it be right. The straps come criss-crossed and the bra was very tight and uncomfortable. I uncrossed the straps and still was not comfortable and had hangover on the sides . The metal piece that holds the strap onto the bra does not stay straight. It turns and digs into the skin. I took it on an overnight trip right after I got it and couldn‚Äôt wait to get home and remove it!,0
2,Clasp broke the first time I used it. It's sitting in my jewelry chest having never been worn. Surprising since TBF is usually okay.,0
4,"I do love this shirt!! Very cute with some skinny jeans. The reviews said it ran small so I ordered up but it was a little big, that's the only reason I didn't give me 5 stars.",1
1,Nice little sandals. Croc-type material  quality and you can‚Äôt beat the price compared to the Birks.<br />UPDATE: BROKE EASILY AFTER 1 week. Whole strap :(,0
2,Not happy with the shirt. The color is not what I expected but I do like it. The material is also not to my liking. There is no stretch at all. I will not be keeping this one.,0
5,This necklace is amazing- I've always had good experiences with alchemy gothic jewelry. Highly recommend,1
5,What you see is what you get. No complaints.,1
4,I bought this top for post op after my breast augmentation because it zips  up and makes it easier to get dressed. Super cute and comfortable. I thought it would be see through being that the material is so thin but it‚Äôs not.,1
3,"I wear a 12 normally. I usually buy small tank tops so that are really snug, to use instead of bras. I bought a large in these and they are like an extra small. They chafe my armpits. But the fabric is a nice weight, not too thin.",0
2,"These come in a pack of three. One of the three had a bad snag in it before I even took it out of its package. As other reviewers stated, these are a very thin Jersey material. I personally don‚Äôt like the fit at all. They are much larger towards the bottom which is annoying and makes the fit look huge. Not practical for working out in as the material wouldn‚Äôt hold up.",0
2,Run small. XL fit my size 6 daughter.,0
4,"Was super excited for these to come in!! I didn't get 100, 1 damaged and missing 2, but overall they're super cute! Packing should be a little more important since it's glass.",1
5,I love these! The fabric is awesome and the fit is perfect.  Super comfortable for workouts or just to run errands paired with my favorite hoodie! I would recommend these to anyone.,1
1,"DID NOT LIKE THESE AT ALL,. LOTS OF STRINGS FROM THE FINGERS WHERE THEY CUT THEM OFF, THEY NEEDED TO FINISH THE TIPS OF THEM AND THEY WERE SHORT ON MY HAND",0
5,Purchased fir my grandson and Gymboree never fails.  But this vest is one of their highest quality items I have purchased yet.  Inside is lined with Sherpa so on top of being soft and fitting to size it‚Äôs classy jacket that will last through 3 boys,1
3,The black jeans are very very stiff and almost rough. They pick up every molecule of dust or hair. It‚Äôs pretty overwhelming. They have an odd feel but worked for what I needed them for.,0
1,The item arrived damaged and I could not get a replacement in time for the event which was the reason I bought the shirt.,0
2,its tight must run small get size or 2 bigger,0
1,It was tiny and not able to cuff to my daughters liking.,0
5,Perfect for afterschool ballet practice,1
5,Love the bag its very spacious,1
5,The best gift ever!,1
3,"Its alright, But very drying to your ears.  Took these with me to Florida, and could only wear one pair because the black ones were the only ones that don't stick to my ears",0
1,"it is very poorly made, the pockets are hideous.  I really want me money back.  I only gave one star bc i couldnt give less!",0
5,Wife loved it and uses everywhere. Highly recommend and specially for the price.,1
5,The handbag is beautiful. It arrived in no time.,1
3,The skirt is cute and comfortable but it is NOT navy blue as shown. It is purple.,0
3,"[[VIDEOID:7012949cdef17004ae82b8031e7c1b5e]] NOTHING WRONG WITH 3 STARS!! Don't let that scare you off.  I just happen to have some 4 and 5 star sunglasses that cost A LOT more than these and trust me, these aren't that.  That being said, for the price, these are great glasses.  You get 2 pair! They work great and look okay.  Watch the video for a closer look.  But yes, 3 stars because they are good, average, shades.",0
3,Cheap,0
3,ok,0
1,"Very cheap quality, fits very frumpy.  Don't recommend.",0
1,Fits very loose on my head and screw has already fallen out of arm,0
2,"Didn‚Äôt quite care for the material, made me feel like an senior citizen so i quickly returned",0
1,Pockets were too high- literally above my waist.,0
4,"soooo soft, love the design, comfortable.",1
5,I needed a sterling chain to repair a necklace. This was perfect. Very fine. Nice and shiny. Great price too!,1
3,"Very cheap, but you get what you pay for.",0
1,"I have had this wallet for 3 weeks and the leather by the snap has pulled away from the stitching already.  Soon, it will rip away completely rendering the wallet unusable.  It is a shame to have spent the money on a nicely laid-out wallet only to have the workmanship on it turn out to be so faulty.  Will not deal with Travelsky again.",0
3,Plus the lenses fogged up and I had to keep pulling them off my face to let air in to remove the fog and when I do that with my onion hands then my eyes burned anyway,0
3,I love it but the material is a thinner that I expected but my son loves it,0
3,kind of cheap looking,0
5,"not bad, little big",1
5,Very cool shades,1
3,turned copper from wearing it,0
1,"Terrible quality! The shirt was faded and stained, like someone had worn it and washed it in bleach. It was NOT a new item. Gross!",0
5,Just as described. They do not look cheap.,1
5,"This is a really nice shirt, colors pop, nice weight fabric!",1
5,"I bought to take on short trips so I don't have to carry a big purse. Perfect for dinners out, especially if you need readers to see the menu.<br />Have recd many compliments on the bag. I do love it.",1
1,Kind of cheap one of the belts holders broke already,0
5,"Great band, comfortable and affordable. Thank you!",1
1,Clasp came undone real easy. It came off my arm multiple times. I found myself just getting mad and leaving it off. Finally I lost the little metal keeper and then the band was completely useless. Going to be trash soon.,0
3, ,0
5,"I really like them, except the blue pair is shedding. Other than that they are great",1
4,They are longer than I expected but very nice.  Fun to wear,1
1,It was a reap off . It should be advised for young girls.,0
5,Very satisfied. Product was as described. Price was excellent. Free shipping sealed the deal.,1
5,Cute and flattering!,1
5,Awesome mask... great for cold weather,1
4,"It was much too small for me, and unfortunately, larger size options were not available. The bra itself is very nice and the lights and remote controller work just fine. But, one-hundred dollars is a lot of money to spend on something that does not fit.",1
5,Excelente calidad !,1
1,HATE this dress!!! It‚Äôs way too short (literally can see my butt without even bending over) and the material is GARBAGE. Such a bummer because the design is really cute in theory. I got a size up and it was still skin tight and waaaaay too short,0
4,"It is very cute and cute flattering on me. It seems a little bit big but maybe it is suppose to be baggy. I love it, highly recommend.",1
3,Love the shirt but definitely runs very small,0
3,"Bought these several years ago.  Use waders mostly, but these hippers a couple of times per year on small streams or very low water.  After at most 10 uses the taped seam inside the neoprene foot is peeling off at the edge.  Not leaking yet but just a matter of time, so I just glued the tape back down with Aquaseal. Fingers crossed.",0
3,Nice for kids. Not quality product to gift an adult.,0
4,"Good product,,,,good price.....Thanks!",1
5,"Absolutely love this dress. The cut is so flattering and the fabric has a nice drape and maybe even a little bit of stretch. The color is very pretty but not great for my skin tone. The price is fantastic for the quality. Unfortunately I ultimately had to return it because I am nursing a little one, and I found the buttons a little too difficult to manage with one hand. I would definitely recommend especially if you have a darker or olive skin tone.",1
3,"Much shorter than in photos.  Also material is odd.  Not cotton.  Back is cool, but unless you have a really short torso, wearing it will be hard for a man.",0
5,nice value,1
1,The shoes are very large.,0
4,"it is good, material is not bad, be aware of the top part it might be slightly tight at the hips area, and it is sooo long it needs to be adjusted ( I am 158 cm so I am kinda short)",1
5,"Love it, nice and comfy. Not too tight or to loose. material is not to thin or to thick. I order another style from same place because I liked it so much.  I ordered the XL size so it wouldn't be snug. I was wanting a few t-shirts I didn't need to worry about my tummy being emphasized so I ordered a size up from what I'd normally order. Which worked out perfectly for me. I can breath in comfort yet look cute on my feeling extra bloated days. Quick delivery and washes as well as dries great in the machines.",1
3,Not the best quality. Not bad for back up but probably would not order again.,0
4,love the color,1
5,Shut up baby I know it,1
5,"It‚Äôs still wintry where I am, but I can‚Äôt wait to take these kayaking when the ice goes out. For now, they are great to wear around to combat snow glare. I am particularly impressed by how lightweight and comfortable these are. You almost forget that you are wearing them and the spring hinges apply just the right amount of pressure to keep the sunglasses in place without feeing uncomfortable. In addition, the frames don‚Äôt touch my high cheekbones, so this is a major win. I can honestly say I have never owned any eyewear like this. The magnetic storage case and microfiber pouch are great add-ons too. Both the sunglasses and the case are carefully crafted and it shows. Overall, this is truly a lovely set to get yourself or as a gift for someone who loves being on the water.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Lightweight & comfortable to wear but solid-feeling<br />+ Tested it and they do float (you can skip those foam floaties for the temples)<br />+ Made from bamboo (sustainable) & look nice<br />+ Polarized lenses that block 99.9% of UVA/B garbage in the sky<br />+ Wayfarer style frames never go out of style<br />+ Matching magnetic bamboo storage case + microfiber bag<br />+ They don‚Äôt rest on high cheekbones (if you have high cheekbones, you know what I mean)<br /><br />Possible Cons:<br />- Price and having to decide on just one frame and lens color combo",1
3,Nice product  size larger than expected,0
5,One of my favorite shoe to wear now. Comfy and stylish,1
3,Not to impressed with it.,0
5,"I wore these to a cat-themed party, and they were perfect for that. The title suggests using it for running, but I don't think your legs will really be able to breathe that well in these so I recommend against that.",1
5,Exactly what I wanted,1
5,Great running socks. No blisters.,1
5,Perfect love it ordering more colors,1
1,"I loved these at first. They fit great, were supportive, and slightly thicker material than most leggings. I don't have the issue of them falling down or feeling like you can see through them. However, now they have started to separate and create holes at the seems in the crotch. They were SUPER expensive for this to happen. I wash them appropriately, and wear them maybe once a week. I dont constantly pull at them either, and am (especially now) careful as to how i put them on. So disappointed.",0
1,"Horrible quality. Other people's reviews had me thinking the quality would be ok but it wasn't. 1st thing my daughter said when I put the widely oversized shirt on, was &#34;Owwww mommy. Owwww!! Take it off!!&#34;  It was horrible. Also, I didn't know I ordered a super sized shirt and super sized shorts with a waistline of a tiny baby doll. Don't buy. Huge mistake.",0
4,"I purchased the 8929OB as a temp replacement for my stolen Rolex. The look and dimensions seems to about the same (IMHO). However the wristband feels a little lighter than the original. I've owned this watch for about two months so I cannot attest to it's durability over time. It does come with a five year warrantee. It does look good as arm candy. I've tracked it's accuracy against the U.S. Atomic Clock. This watch gained 20 sec in seven days. If you want an accurate chronograph do not buy this watch....nor a Rolex for that matter. My Oyster Perpetual kept lousy time. I used the timing of my GPS to measure the Rolex. It would be off by a couple seconds daily. If you want an accurate watch this is not for you. I'd recommend a battery powered Casio or similar watch. I'm told mechanical watches (like this and the Rolex) simply cannot be accurate due to the nature of their mechanical bits moving about. True or not, I do know this watch does not keep accurate time. So why the four stars? For me, the look and feel of this watch as motivation to purchase another Rolex is more important than an accurate time piece. It does look good, so I'm putting looks over performance in this case.",1
3,"This is a good value for the money....however, not All of the acrylic plates snapped into place when inserted the picture.<br />Please note, that you can not put two images back to back for front/back view .  The acrylic cover will not snap into place.  We ended up printing on double sided paper, which helped a lot , but we still had 1 out of 10 that did not snap into place.  The actual ring itself isn't very strong.... but if you are giving as an event item,  it works out well.",0
5,Added scrambled eggs which makes this cap look great!,1
3,"Looks like the picture but it‚Äôs SOOOO big. I got a M and it was definitely more of an XL maybe even bigger. And it‚Äôs poorly sewn, seems don‚Äôt line up anywhere on it.",0
4,my daughter loves it.,1
5,Excellently made. Color is great. Our friends how nice my husband looks in adult shirts. Look forward to more.,1
5,These were so great I got them in a different size as well. They‚Äôre so light weight you don‚Äôt feel them yet they are substantial enough to show off well if that makes sense. And a true gold color. Love them.,1
1,Came bent and late.,0
2,Cardboard in hat bill means not able to wash :(,0
1,Cannot use on iPhones,0
4,The strap adjusters make noise when moving around. It doesn‚Äôt affect function or comfort just slightly annoying.,1
5,Cute shoes. Holding up so far!,1
5,Perfect,1
3,I love the material and it's very comfortable but the fronts are too narrow so it sits under my arms and doesn't go over my breasts.,0
1,Poor poor quality.,0
5,"Flows on your body, lightweight and pretty. May need steaming out of box/bag. Love my purchase.",1
4,Xsmall would be better I think you could buy a size down on them. Nice quality for the cost,1
5,"I love it, just wished I had bigger boobs to fill the top in more. But that‚Äôs a personal issue I believe.<br />Overall it‚Äôs super cute. I can‚Äôt seem to find a bra that I can wear and hide it well. I bought a size small and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 104lbs. Wide hips and small waist.",1
3,"It's a bit too big and stretch too easily, cheap material.",0
2,"Top handle broke on day two. Poor stichwork on a thin material.<br />Backpack straps are not designed well, with the straps pulled uncomfortably snug the pack still sits low enough that it rests on the fender of my bike and rubs the paint.",0
2,"okay enough, but the thread that wraps around the band to hold the two straps that go between your two toes unravelled on 2nd wear.  not a big deal, but it's not the same profile as the other shoe now.  not the greatest all the other reviews say they are...but they are well padded shoes....",0
1,"Cheap, thin material that shrunk majorly in cold wash.  Good for pjs and that's it.",0
1,This products are torn and not well Stitching,0
5,"Love them, great quality",1
5,Grest product,1
4,"A little smaller than I'd like, but pretty",1
5,"very good looking sox for a man, perfect acessory for the stylish male",1
5,PERFECT FIT...TOOL KIT ...AWESOME,1
1,"I thought I was saving money. Cheap products and choices, end up being more costly. After 8 month or normal use, right temple broke.True Titanium does not brake. And in order not to loose the money spent on progressive lenses, I must end up buying another pair. Do not commit same mistake.I did.",0
2,Great colors just runs super small,0
2,It's really pretty hot its huge! The arms didnt light up at all. Bummer.,0
3,CUTE,0
5,"I love the high waist, I don't have to wear spanx! These are very heavy and will be good for fall.",1
3,Works well as a spare pair in the car.  Doesn't really protect the eyes very well.,0
5,well done,1
4,I wear a size 6 and these fit perfect.,1
5,Just as listed,1
2,Side pockets not big enough at all for me.,0
4,"Bought the sloth one for my son for when we go hiking or beach. He loves it, it's comfortable on his neck/shoulder and lightweight. Just slightly smaller then expected. But still absolutely worth it",1
2,"The quality seems nice enough, but this is too small to hold more than two credit cards.",0
3,Nice looking pendant but the locket hinge is a little lose and doesn't lock in place so easily and doesn't always stay shut.  But the price is ok.  Cheap price fits the quality.  I plan on adding a piece of felt to the center and using this as an essential oil diffuser necklace.,0
3,Nice necklace if you don't mind having to untangle it a million times.,0
3,But it one size bigger because will shrink after the first wash,0
5,I really like the Gloria Vanderbilt pants.  They fit well are are well made.,1
3,Bought this for a costume party and it ripped the same night. Also too big for the size,0
1,So bad,0
2,"The photo on these jeans looked amazing (almost like it was pulled from Revolve or something), but the jeans in person were a disappointment. They certainly run really big - I‚Äôm normally a S (26 in jeans) and after reading the reviews I purchased an XS - I was still swimming in these. The front of them is baggy around the crotch area and I have to imagine they pinned them on the model in the photo cause her waist looks very small. I will say they were better quality than I expected from Amazon jeans, but clearly not as good as what you‚Äôd find in a department store. The button was definitely tight, but I was able to button them and it probably wouldn‚Äôt have stopped me from keeping them if they had fit correctly.",0
3,Black started to peel after a few months,0
5,‚ù§,1
5,Love the color and fit of this dress.  I ordered the XXL (I usually wear a 14W) and it fits perfectly.  Pleased with purchase.,1
1,Color comes off,0
5,"I bought the cases because they were so inexpensive....but not cheap. I gave them out to my crew to carry safety glasses on the fire truck, The cases are small enough to fit in the coat or pants pocket and are more sturdy than expected. Can you crush them with your grip? Yes. They are not rigid cases but have held up so far. The zipper is very lightweight but none have failed...yet. They are easily large enough for our safety glasses and my Costas.",1
2,I cannot read Chinese. I hand washed it and hung to dry. The hoodie sting came off completely. Jeez.,0
4,Very cute. It was a bit big. The only complaint is that it pilled on the inside the first time I used it.,1
1,Would have given it zero stars if it was available. I ordered two only received one and it is so small that only my four year old could wear it.,0
3,It wrinkles after hand washing. I did not like that. It is comfortable though.,0
3,"My daughter is in a 10 and a half, I bought an 11 and they were way too small. Also one strap is longer than the other. Really disappointing, especially since the shoes are really cute! Have to return them.",0
4,Liked it ... very small ... looked eligent. Value for money . But may fall need to take care of it.,1
4,"I am literally swimming in this thing, but it goes nicely over whatever i have on as well.... all good!",1
5,So comfortable.,1
2,"This material is really thin, like a very low nap terry cloth.  You cannot see through real velvet, but my photos clearly show you can easily see through this ‚Äúcape‚Äù.  I plan to return it.",0
5,Excellent pair of compression socks that have graduated compression from the toes on up to the knee area. The fabric is moisture wicking so it keeps sweat away from your skin which can cause bacteria to form. My husband swears by these socks as he is on his feet all day in his job and walking on a concrete floor. By the time he comes home his feet are swollen and pounding. Compression socks make a huge difference is keeping the blood from pooling in his feet and his ankles from swelling.  He has tried many types and this type is his favorite so far.,1
1,"Look like keychain holders, could make these myself for 5 cents or less, very irritating to fingers, very thin and bendable, not worth the money.",0
5,Good service and product,1
5,Awesome!!!!!!!! Didnt expect to like that much!,1
1,Bought the largest size for my women's size 12W feet and normal size calf.  These did not even make it to the ankle no matter how much I struggled.  Returned immediately.,0
4,"Unless you enjoy ironing, be sure to take this out of the dryer or off the clothesline as soon as it is dry. Otherwise it's a very nice garment.",1
2,"I was expecting to have a really good, high-quality pair of gloves when I bought these. It has a $60 price tag, so I assumed $60 quality gloves. Its more of a $20 pair. They are way too small despite ordering the largest 16 oz. Both of the thumb sockets are uncomfortable. At first, I thought it was just a desgin flaw, but the other pair I got were the same way. They are also extremely hard to get on and off. Many people say that you have to break in gloves before they become usable, but they shouldn't hurt your hands like these ones do. I used them for two weeks, and now I can't punch anymore because my knuckles and wrists hurt so badly. They look really cool though (which is why I bought them), but if you are looking for $60 quality gloves, there are way better gloves out there.",0
2,Too small and over priced,0
5,My wife loves it! I like how it shines on her. Love it!,1
1,Demasiado grande para mi hija es de ni√±a o de adulto el gorro si son para ni√±os porque tan grandes,0
5,I love the buckle,1
5,"Fantastic fleece jacket! My second from Billabong, and I could not be happier with both fit, feel, and function.",1
5,liked that they fit,1
2,Somewhat small and material felt more like dress pants material... not what i was expecting...,0
5,"Great price,  cute top. Ties around neck!",1
2,Tapers and tunnels are very short and should not be used for stretching.  2 stars because they are exactly as described.,0
5,"Love them, great fit and great look!",1
2,"Extremely small, looked to be nice otherwise",0
3,"Bought these for my extra large hubby but we had to return the product. They arrived fine & he liked the fabric + pockets. The problem was the thick heavy waist band, it rolled down or folded over every time he say down.  If that wasn't a problem, he would've liked them better.",0
4,I gave these to my friends for Christmas and they are great! So cute and the packaging was outstanding!,1
5,Super cute!,1
1,It‚Äôs extremely big couldn‚Äôt wear at all,0

1,Ordered a XXL.  Fits well if you're a Mediumm.,0
1,These are extremely undercut!!!  An XXL is like a medium!  Nice material but way off base for sizing. If you are going to advertise for plus sizes then make them that way. My size small friend thought they were just right for compression.,0
2,Cute in essence...but made of really sheer chiffon like material. Lace doesn't lay back...it flops forward. I ordered this twice...on accident. Cheap price...cheap product. The crochet lace is nice...may be able to salvage it on another shirt.,0
1,Poor quality. Ratings were already tarnished upon arrival. Would not recommend.,0
2,"While it's a really cute dress and I love the style of it, the arm holes are way too big and show a lot of my bra. I had to return it. There was just no way to wear this without flashing a ton of bra through the arm holes.",0
5,"It is hard to find swimsuits that fit properly, these fit just right, they are great for practice as well as meets.",1
5,I like it,1
5,Love it does not come out easily,1
4,"The print is beautiful.  As much as I love pockets in a dress, this draws attention to my big hips and not in a good way.  Fabric is very stretchy but makes me hot.",1
5,Comfy and sparkly!,1
3,I love the style but the fit is small.<br />I'm not thrilled that I have to pay for shipping in order to exchange<br />for a larger size. Seems they don't really want my business.,0
5,"Very warm, long enough to cover ears, super soft inside, great quality!",1
2,"I loved the raw gemstone but after wearing it a couple of times the finish on the small beads came off, so I returned it.",0
1,Bad construction in the design the fold inside is not tucked and sewn properly...very cheaply designed.,0
5,This is a great dress. Fit was true to size. Color and material are very nice.,1
5,"Just when they think they have you figured out, you come through like the wildcard. This watch should be a new zodiac sign.<br />This watch embodies your distinct precision, your indispensable value, and your bold approach to life. Get ready for the next level.<br />...you deserve it.",1
4,Worked great my daughter liked them.,1
5,So Nice! Goes well with many of My pink outfits!,1
5,Excellent!  Wore Christmas Eve and Christmas Day exactly whst I was looking for,1
1,I do not like matreial...looks cheap.  Looks much nicer on picture....i will return or wear in my house only....disappointed :(,0
3,"Loved the shirt, but it was too small. I ordered a large, but fits more like a medium.",0
4,Very basic and well worth the money.,1
3,I like the variety of beads. One broke immediately which makes me weary of the others. Also I‚Äôm fairly slim so they are a little larger than I would normally want but they are okay,0
5,I really liked this shrug it's nice and light perfect to use as a cover up for a dress,1
2,Ordered XXL<br />And it doesn‚Äôt look right.,0
2,"My wife's wrist measures 5.75"" in circumference, so I ordered her this watch band in size small since it's advertised as being for wrists between 5.0-7.0"".  Unfortunately, it is WAY too big.  She couldn't adjust it tight enough before it ran out of room for further adjustments.  Instead of the small being for wrists between 5-7"", it's more for wrists between 6.5-10.5"" which is even larger than the advertised sizes for the large!  I've attached a picture of the watch band around my wife's lower leg which measured at 10.5"", so readers will know I'm not exaggerating at all.  Sizing issues aside, it is a well made band so I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1.",0
1,The sprayer dribbles product into shoes instead of spraying. Sprayer hardly sprays.,0
5,Love it and washable<br />I spill red wine on it and it came right out,1
1,Not liked,0
1,The 12t was sooo small it barely fit a 10 toddler _ the shoe itself was/is super cute ‚Äò,0
5,Great fit and look like the pink ones we also ordered,1
5,"I am glad I bought this watch. It is cheaply made but I like it. It looks good on my wrist , makes me feel important and stuff (lol). Complements my outfits very well.",1
2,Tangles a lot. And not really proportioned as shown,0
2,"I bought this for myself because I liked the photo of the star fish. I wanted the key chain itself and was not really interested in the rest of items.<br />I have to agree with another reviewer that the key chain looks like a dollar store item. While it is pretty, it's very light weight and cheap looking. I would not recommend this as a gift. The packaging is very good, as stated by other reviewers.  You would expect something with that type of packaging to be better quality.<br />If I had seen this in a store I would not have paid so much for it.<br />After receiving this keychain, I bought a much better quality one for $2 at a local store.",0
4,"I love it!!  I can still see the color of my phone. I haven't dropped it yet, so not sure how well it protects but it seems very durable.",1
5,My son loves anime an he loves this shirt.  Good quality t-shirt sis not shrink 2 sizes after the first washing and the color did not bleed into the laundry.,1
2,This product is cute but the was missing a tooth. It was also alot smaller than i expected it dose not fit my face right. But if i put it over a black mask it does what i intended it to. Scare off men. I feel alot safer thank you.,0
5,nice,1
3,"Overall its okay.<br />I really like the material like silky soft. I got xs and I am 5‚Äù4, 120 and I think it fits snug. I may have to size up. But the reason I gave 3 stars is because of some of the messy stitches on the back. The back of waist band, there are some transparent stings (like fishing lines) sticking out. Other than that its good workout leggings.",0

1,"Beaut, sheer blouse. I ordered two sizes bigger and it still didn't fit though.",0
2,"Zero support and insole feels bouncy...and not in a good way.  Like instead of absorbing impact,  it transfers it directly into your heel.  No arch support.  Very thin footbed.",0
5,Best sun glasses I ever purchased. I have only used one so far because the clip on device is very sturdy.,1
5,They are comfortable. Plus they do what they are supposed to. I loved the packaging and came with cleaning cloths,1
5,Great products! Bought them in green and watermelon. These are much cheaper than other products but overall a good product.,1
3,It was to thin. Wanted it more thicker,0
1,This is 95% Rayon. Horrible fabric and no linen or cotton. Avoid,0
5,üëç,1
3,"good quality fabric, but there is a lot of material on the dress that weighs down on the skinny spaghetti straps. I ordered a small but it seemed like a large because of all the material. kind of felt like a parachute. this dress is good if you like extra room. had to return because too big.",0
1,"Crappy plastic collar/tonsure insert and thin, cheap feeling, fabric.",0
5,Great value.....exceeded expectations....easy to install....the only thing missing (if you can catch it) is the small Toyota logo in the center......,1
5,Classic jeans purse. Comfortable purse strap. Holds quite a bit too.,1
5,i have worn this nearly every day since it arrived. i couldn't be more happy with the color and the fit.,1
1,Paper thin looks cheap,0
5,Nice belt. Too small for hubby,1
4,"This is a nice bag, but the handles are NOT long at all.  Actually, they're a little short to wear the bag comfortably over my shoulder.<br /><br />I am updating my review to account for the seller's response to my comments. The seller contacted me almost immediately to address my concerns and my issue with the bag was resolved immediately, with no hassle.",1
1,Picture CLEARLY shows CLAY chips.  I received the CHEAP PLASTIC RIDGED chips.  I could buy 100 more of the chips I received at a Job Lot chain store for $10 less.  IMMEDIATE Return!,0
4,These are great for keeping little hands warm and are very easy to put on!,1

2,Majesty heat look flat . Not flattering but it it is very pretty and comfortable,0
5,"These are really cute earrings. You have so many options of using them without getting your ears pierced. I like that they come in two colors and that you have a few, in case you lose them since they can easily get lost.<br />They are fairly small. They came in a cute black bag in case you are wanting them for a gift, or even for traveling it's an nice accessory so you do not need to worry about losing them.<br />Overal I really like them and seem pretty good for the price.<br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. I hope it's helpful to anyone who is considering in buying it.",1
5,"I love this wallet. I was looking for something I could carry around downtown without needing a big bag but I could keep close to my body. Plenty of room for cards, cash, keys and cell phone. Great color and it appears well made. I've received a lot of compliments.",1
1,"Did not work at all, the metal pieces that keep the laces in will scratch your feet and leave painful marks. Sadly I can't return these due to their &#34;policy&#34;. Don't waste your money.",0
5,"Nice construction. Seems small at first, but fits fine without spreading thin enough to feel any breeze through the knit.",1
4,Quite a bit longer than expected. Very comfy and flowy. After a month or so there is slight pleating of fabric that gives a more grey tone versus black. Like it but probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase again.,1
1,"The picture of this hat is very deceiving. It looks like the hat is pulled on to the women‚Äôs head.  In reality the hat is SO small is only can sit on the top of my 10 yr old daughter‚Äôs head. She can not wear it.  It will not pull on to her head at all.  IF it would fit anyone, it would be a fun hat.",0
1,The stitching on the right sleeve has came apart. Very disappointed with this item.,0
5,"THANKS, SMOOTH AS BUTTER",1
5,Cute shirt that's true to size. Soft Material and comfortable. Love Schitts creek and love the design,1
4,"Very cute dress. Unlined, so I wear a slip underneath it. I don't understand the red belt, so I switched that out for a black one. But the red belt is nice, I've worn it with other outfits.",1
5,"My husband and I were both looking for bifocal sunglasses to use during playing golf.  With using smart phones more and more, it was getting crazy to change from sunglasses to readers all the time.  Although we do not wear them while actually swinging the club, the bifocal if very small but super well placed to wear during all 18 holes.  An added bonus is that you can lengthen the ""arms"" and even tilt them to fit even better.  If you are looking for bifocal and sporty sunglasses these are great for the price!",1
5,Perfect sunglasses for a 2 year old! Indestructible!,1
5,These fit my watch perfectly.  Comfortable material.,1
2,"These are really cute but they run slightly smaller than expected, also expected them to be longer but they were laid right around the waist area",0
5,I bought one for field work in sunny day. Got the wrong one delivered first but the seller reshipped a right one after I contacted the seller. I appreciate their customer service and the product well protects my neck from sun burn. I will use it also when I travel as it looks cool and smart.,1
5,fun party gift,1
5,"love this purse. perfect color, lots of room. i likr the detatchable strap too",1
5,"Super cute, love the color, smaller than what I was expecting. Really good quality for the price, I was surprised how sturdy they feel. I can‚Äôt be on my phone or computer without blue light glasses and these do the job",1
1,Looks mediocre. Not like the picture. Looks cheap. Get what you pay for.,0
1,Absolutely Garbage,0
1,1000000000% not what you thought you were buying. Color is completely different than advertised . Returning ASAP,0
2,I am a slim size 4 and the arms were still tight.,0
5,These earrings are small but they are very pretty!,1
5,"Very nice youth T-shirt, soft material, reinforced modified V neck, longer than most T shirts and slightly longer in back, which we like.<br />The boy is an avid fan of the Patriots so this was a nice surprise for him.<br />Quality material in a well-made garment, finished seams and hems throughout, no raw edges to fray.",1
4,"Thought it would be a heavier material, but i still like it.  Love the longer sleeves",1
5,Great quality material,1
5,"This is one of the nicest tops I have ever purchased.  I wish it came in more colors.....for I would purchase several.  It is so comfortable, lightweight, yet a nice quality of material.  It flows and makes me feel like it slims my appearance.  I highly recommend this top.",1
2,"Great leggings for under a tunic, but not really workout leggings. They are very soft, but not supportive at all.<br />Also, I got two black and one turquoise; no blue, like the order I placed. :(",0
2,Disappointing. These are very thin and run very small.,0
3,"Very tiny.  Not good for long hair because the earrings gets tangled in the hair.  But the earrings are cute and a good value.  These are especially nice for a young girl, I think.",0
3,Good quality but runs small.  I bought for my daughter and am glad I read the reviews...she typically wears an adult small and I got her a large which fits perfectly.,0
1,The screw on the right ear piece came out on all four pairs.  I can only conclude the screwhole is too big.  I will not purchase these again.,0
3,"I think I am shaped wrong for this shirt.  It is really pretty but does not hang well on me around the waist, and has too much in the bust-line area (gapping).  Usually cross-over wrap shirts are very flattering on me.",0
5,Coolest glasses! It's a pair that you can wear when it's cloudy and it helps to brighten up everything. I absolutely love them and get compliments wherever I go.,1
5,I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and wanted to make sure it was long enough for my arms and it was. I will be ordering more!!,1
5,"The jacket is really made of legit leather, and the price is coherent with the quality (which is great by the way). It‚Äôs really warm and comfortable, plus the shipping was extra efficient as the jacket arrived two days earlier than expected, even though it was delayed for 2 days at customs.",1
3,"Super cute joggers! Thin, super soft material...kiddo loves them! However, sizing is inconsistent. Ordered 3 more pairs after receiving the first. All 4 are marked M (8-10) but are different sizes. All are bigger than the first pair received, one pair at least an entire size. Washed them before checking and now I can't return. Would recommend as comfy lounge wear or pj's but make sure you check the size you receive first.",0
5,These tanks fit perfectly!,1
5,"To big it was returned,will reorder smaller size",1
4,Very soft good material and it was a comfortable dress to go with my Renaissance outfit.,1
2,You get what you pay for. Cheep.,0
5,Good quality. People alway complimenting me ok this pretty design,1
1,They‚Äôre a lot bigger than expected,0
5,"I ordered these for my twin grandsons and am very happy with the purchase. Very soft, well made and the fit is just right!",1
3,"I really liked the appearance of these, and the fact that the side arms were normal thickness, not so wide like most of them are.  Makes it easier to see what's to the side of you when driving.  On the other hand, these sunglasses were just gigantic and made me look like a child wearing her mothers glasses for dress-up.  I was very sad to have to return them because of this. They just looked ridiculous on me . Really wish these type of glasses came in different sizes rather than one size in each style. They were really attractive which is hard to find but just didn't work for me. Bummer.",0
5,"Just what I wanted, perfect size and lightweight. Just enough zippers to be organized.",1
5,"These boots are super cute! I could definitely wear these with a dress or jeans. They are the perfect height for any girl looking to dress up a little. I love how the design is somewhat simple so you don't feel like you're over doing it too much. They fit perfectly for me and I would highly recommend anyone looking for cute ankle boots to get these! Disclaimer: I received this product for free, or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

3,"Wasn't what the picture shows<br /> For a birthday gift for a man, should have been little bigger links.. Get what I paid for!",0
3,"The gradient tint was a bit blurry, seems like the &#34;darkener&#34; was applied to thickly.",0
5,Product arrived promptly & just what I wanted,1
3,Earrings were very pretty but are deceiving! They aren't even a quarter of the size pictured. Would look great on my 4 year old niece.,0
3,They might be a good sandal for somebody else - they are well made. Very solid. But I needed more support. The heel feels like It‚Äôs lower than my toes. I‚Äôm sending them back. But if they‚Äôre the structure - they might be good for you.,0
3,The items does not fit as displayed. Body typed displayed is of very very petite and short. the illusion sis not for an average thin body type as mine. Nothing wrong with the dress just not fitting as shown. I ordered the largest to get the swayed looked.,0
2,"After a few washes shrunk a little, and keep riding up.",0
5,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He is a BIG Arsenal fan. It isn't his warmest hat, but he loves it for milder winter days.",1
5,Good quality!,1
5,"I bought this purse for an upcoming trip.  It features enough room for my essentials, yet still looks sleek and well constructed.  Looking forward to using it.",1
4,Fits perfect.,1
5,My daughter loves these!,1
5,i wear it to work everyday. it's equally classy and casual so it's a watch for all occasions,1
4,Sleeves pretty big kinda annoy me but rest fit as expected think I'll cut sleeves off mine make muscle jersey out of it rest of it I liked fine. Feel tough heavier like most real jerseys are. Great color to.,1
5,Every Jason fan would love these.  Nicely made and super comfy.,1
5,Fits great . Good quality,1
5,Nice material perfect  fit and  size,1
5,Great item,1
3,It was cute but had to give it to my daughter. She liked it,0
5,I bought this for a Minnie Mouse outfit.  It fit just right and looks really cute.  It‚Äôs also well-made.,1
2,"The zodiac design on this keychain is so pretty and when I received it, it was true to the photo. The problem was that the keychain appeared much sturdier and more durable in the photo than it actually was. I thought the medallion would have a little heft to it, but it does not. Also, the zodiac sign is basically a sticker, and a poorly-adhered one at that! I am more careful about my possessions than the average person, but in less than a week, and with normal key usage, the Taurus emblem had fallen off of the keychain, never to be seen again. Now I have this empty, flimsy, sad circle hanging from my keychain. Not cool.",0
5,When I saw these palm tree earrings I fell in love with them. I use to live down the coast in the 1960‚Äôs. I love the beach and palm trees. These earrings are perfect to wear to the beach. They seem very well made and they are very beautiful. I‚Äôm very please with this purchase.,1
1,poor quality,0
4,"This is so cute! I got a medium and I'm very petite but curvy, my a** eats this romper lol which sucks but it looks great on. It's sexy and summery! I wish the length of the romper itself was a little longer so it wouldn't be riding up. The tail is pretty long, you have to be careful not to trip but it's really not that big of a hassle. The material is high quality and the colors are beautiful.",1
5,"This is just the quality you hope it will be when you see it online. It looks exactly as expected. The colors are bright, the fabric is soft, and there is plenty of room for a child (or adult, even) to fit in it.",1
1,Don‚Äôt get this one it don‚Äôt even foam up or anything well not be buying again ü§¨üò§,0
3,"The sizing was good, although I tend to have a wide foot, & these shoes are somewhat narrow. Overall they are a very good shoe!",0
1,Definitely not true to size.  The xxxl fit my 10 year old grandchild.,0
5,Just what I need. Perfect for carrying a little extra cash.,1
1,"I like the idea of these foldable glasses. They look great, but... Difficult to open as hinges are very tight. Within the first few times I've worn them the string holding the lens in broke and the lens fell out.",0
5,looks good. fit & finish is really nice.  My British wife LOVES it!,1
5,Nothing to dislike; I especially appreciate the 2 large inside pockets.,1
2,Nice material and fit. Just didn‚Äôt realized that there wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúC‚Äù to complete the word until after ordering.  Spelling makes no sense.<br />Gave it away.,0
5,"As an immunocompromised person, this stylish mask is PERFECT! I wear it over my medical grade mask to add style to my outfit when I go to church, a celebration or any event",1
2,The under layer of the yellow dress is a stark white that cheapens the whole look. I sent this one back.,0
5,"I have never used a tool like this but when I was making pillows with piping edge, it helped to make the corner turns perfectly. It was easy to hold. I was amazed how easy this was. The shape point was able to get under the foot where I could not! Love this little tool and wish o knew about it sooner!",1
5,Its perfect and handy! I can now store more cards in one wallet. I also like how thin it looks from the outside even after you store more.,1
1,The straps got ripped! And I probably uses about 5 times.,0
3,"The coat fit as expected, but the upper arms are too small.",0
3,The beads are beautiful but the description says the bracelet is adjustable and it is not.,0
5,Fits really well & the baby loves to wear them! I also love the pouch and the strap,1
3,"I ordered the v pattern with the colors black, white, and grey. However, I received a sweater with a horizontal pattern of these colors. I liked the sweater, but was not happy that the pattern differed from what I ordered because that was the pattern I wanted. Even though it wasn't the pattern that I wanted I still like the sweater. It is thick and warm, feels like a cable knit sweater. I ordered a size medium and am 160 pounds and 5'8 1/2"" tall and it fit well. I had no issues with the length of the sweater or the arms being short. The turtleneck is shorter, but I like that.",0
3,Very pretty but small,0
4,Its not as comfortable as I would like in the armpit area. Its a little scratchy. But otherwise doesnt wrinkle easily and looks as expected!,1
1,"Was this supposed to be 7/8 length?!? Super disappointed! I normally wear a Large, I order XXXL and it fits snugly but it‚Äôs WAAAAY TOO SHORT!",0
3,"Smaller waist. larger hips. The elastic seemed not to be too stretchy. But, I can still wear it.",0
5,Cute and daughter loves it!  Good quality.,1
2,"The hands were loose, and the skirt is see-through. I tried to wear with grey tulle-skirts underneath, that way it became a bit puffy which was nice. But I decided to return it as the fabric is not comfortable to wear. It is itchy and does not fit where it is supposed to fit.",0
5,"Bought this as an xmas gift for my father that wears baseball hats 24/7 for as long as I can remember. he's going to absolutely love this. the packaging was nice, as well, wrapped up protectively.",1
5,It‚Äôs beautiful just cheaply made and small,1
5,"Great sweater; I sized down bc it is oversized and I wanted it more fitting; great quality, soft, love the color; looking at buying other colors",1
1,"Most important part is to get the color correct. Ordered red/white/grey and got maroon/white/grey. Not worth sending back, waste of money.",0
5,"For me personally it is small but it works. For my partner it was too big but then its adjustable so thats perfect. I am positive that it was just my hair that made it too small. Which is not any fault of the companies. The hat itself is great and it looks super sexy. I love how it feels.

5,My daughter totally love the shoes we are both ordering more in various colors so please keep them on stock. The rose gold matched her evening gown perfectly!,1
2,"Sent me a purple stone instead of the blue.  Also, I did not like the chain that was on it originally and it fell off the better chain because the loop was not pinched together enough.  I think they should have used a solid loop.  Nice amulet - structure not thought out.",0
3,It's ok for our short Florida winters.,0
2,It‚Äôs shiny and cheap looking.,0
3,"I loved this style and had several colors. My black pair the ‚Äúleather‚Äù peeled off after my wearing them in the salt too much. I found this pair that is by look, the same style. However, they changed the sole. It went from soft and comfortable to hard and not as comfortable.",0
5,Great shirt and great quality. I would recommend to anyone,1
5,"Excellent fit, soft fabric, rich color. Love it!",1
1,I didn't like the color of the zipper.  It didn't match the color of the side color orange.,0
1,No good,0
4,"Pilling and starting to look dirty because of it. But, it's comfy. So, now I need a What Not To Wear intervention.",1
2,Sizing was not accurate.  The colors on the shorts were just as shown....but it didn't even come close to fitting my husband.,0
1,Too big for my 10 yrs daughter ok look old fashion,0
1,"This bucket purse is so unusual from what's on the market that I am getting many compliments on my find. Quality is good but it needs a stronger base since it tends to collapse when put in a standing position. I expected better than this from Guess who is known for it's quality.<br />01/13/2020: Update: I gave it 4 stars to start but I'm revising - not only that it lacks a base, but the zipper isn't working even though I hardly use the purse and the silver has tarnished!!  What a waste of my money!!  GUESS DISAPPOINTED ME THIS TIME AROUND!!",0
2,Nice earrings but didn't fit my ear hole .,0
5,loved it,1
5,They look great and wear well.,1
4,"The material is much softer and more comfortable for all-day wear than the cheaper competitors.  I am docking one star because I agree with other reviewers that these are not ""easy on.""  I'm a 57-year-old woman of average strength and it takes me a lot of effort to put them on.  If I were older or disabled I would not be able to do it.  Other than that, these offer perfect support for a long day on your feet, and they are not scratchy against the skin.",1
1,They don‚Äôt look like the picture. Don‚Äôt like them.,0
3,",zipper very stiff,expected to be better quality.",0
4,"Love the material , fitts me nice but just a bit too short around d ancle",1
4,It is great came fast and is nice came in a cute bag aswell if you love four leaf clovers this is something to get,1
4,"Haven't worn the dress yet, but it was a perfect fit!",1
1,Very very thin,0
5,Very nice fabric. Good for summer. Fits as expected.,1
5,Fits fine.,1
2,"Love the look, but the arm squeaks loudly when unfolded.",0
5,I love it,1
1,Cheaply made. Lace unequally cut and coming off,0
5,I had this dress custom made to fit my body and boy was it gorgeous! I bought it for Halloween costume as Jessica Rabbit.,1
1,Didnt do much of anything,0
4,17 year old daughter loved!,1
1,Had an order to the fabric,0
1,"The fabric was not sheer, it was like a pillowcase- a cheap satin pillowcase.",0
3,Cute shrug but fit needs to be better.  I guess I needed to order a smaller size.  It‚Äôs rather boxy.,0
1,I ordered one size up.  Should have gone up about four sizes.  Tiny.  Not designed for a chest and hips.  Liked the material.  Very disappointed.,0
5,A gift,1
3,"They are cute, but the noses fell off the red dogs within the first 15 minutes my 2 yr old son wore them.",0
2,Super cute tank can dress up or down. But it runs VERY small. I typically wear large (12/14) which is what I ordered. Fits like a small. Could barely get over my head. Kinda disappointed that I have to return.  I would say size up 2 sizes for true fit,0
5,Good quality.,1
3,I love this dress. It is one of my favorites just because it's super comfortable and the print is very pretty. It gets only 3 stars because it's cheaply made. I have to keep sewing up holes that randomly appears at the seams. This is my only problem with the dress. I did get it for about $6 so what was I expecting? It is also very thin material so I would suggest anyone who decides to buy it to buy a slip so you can't see through it.,0
2,Dissapointed with the pearl being flat on one side. Otherwise OK for the price. I returned it.,0
2,The slipper socks fit well and they're very soft. Not very thick though. Truly typical sock-like thickness. Based on the thickness and the little non-slip discs they would likely be most comfortable on carpeted floors. On tile or wood floors you can feel the hardness of the discs. Had one of the straps not broken the first time I put it on I'd have given 3 stars.,0
2,"Love the product, but it fell apart on first use. It literally fell apart at the seams. Sorry, the product would have been wonderful if it would have help up after one use.",0
5,These silk liners are really comfortable and warm!,1
5,"Such a cute casual tee!! It‚Äôs sheer so you‚Äôll have to wear a cami under it. Nice soft fabric. Fabric does seem delicate so if you have a mesh washing bag, put the shirt in it when doing your laundry. I‚Äôm 180 and the large fit me perfectly without being tight or too lose.",1
4,Love the style of the dress however its not the most greatly made piece of clothing. A level under f21 if you will. But overall its still cute. Just not sure if itll hold up in a wash..,1
1,"I wanted so bad to like this, but I had a few issues. First the two chains were not the correct length so that the triangles lined up. Instead they were crooked and constantly needed adjusting. Second the metal was scuffed in a few obvious places, making it look really cheap. Lastly the size was not ideal, I was maybe hoping for something more dainty. It was a gamble but one I think I will be sending back unfortunately.",0
5,This was a gift.  Nice emblem and T-shirt.,1
5,Perfect size adjustable!,1
5,I love them. So comfortable which I would never say jeans are until these.,1
1,The buckle survived only 2 years before it broke.  Up until then worked great.,0
3,Disappointed as looks more like a long tshirt.,0
5,Love it!,1
3,"It's a good hat. Looks good. It's bowl is just a little too deep and the mesh rubs on the top of my ears. So in result it's slightly uncomfortable. There is a gap between the front of the hat and my forehead so the fabric behind the logo has obvious signs of open space and makes it look a little funky. I'm an average sized guy. So if you have a small head, don't buy this hat. Other than that though, it's a great hat. Idk if I'll buy another though.",0
1,This was worthless. You couldn‚Äôt even use it,0
3,"i bought because i liked the pattern I like things with stars its not great but I am keeping it anyway because of the pattern. the fabric is a mesh overlay so the skirt is lined but the top is not so it will need a cami. the waist measurements are a bit large my waist is 32 and i got the large i wanted more length and i was planning on belting it anyway its not tight in the waist so that measurement must be the relaxed non stretched numbers.  The waist also sits a bit higher than natural waist but again planned on belting it anyway so no big deal. it is short I'm 5'2 ish and if i raise my arms the lining of the skirt is just covering my butt forget bending over. my fix for this was to wear with leggings and i could see from the picture that it was going to need this. all in all doable with accessories, ok for the price ( I paid 18.99)but not great",0
4,I'm satisfied with the gloves. They are on the thinner side but that was as expected. I haven't washed them yet but I would assume they'll be fine in cold water and after air-drying.,1
1,Its cute but i followed the size review and the xl fits like a medium. The top had almost no coverage for my 36 Ds. And the bottoms fit weird small on the waist to big on the cheeks. I have a small butt but this was ridiculous.,0
5,They were perfect but last week I went to put them on and they broke,1
2,"These &#34;fit most&#34; sizing is horribly wrong. I am a size 8.5, about as average as can be. They were very tight on my feet, scrunching up my toes. Also, where the bottom and top are sewn together is a seam that is very uncomfortable. I purchased these at a discounted price, but will be returning as they don't fit.",0
5,One of my favorite pieces. The leather is nice and comfortable to wear.,1
2,Took the hooks off and ordered some wires to hang the circles off of. Way too small for me with this closure style. Small child size.,0
3,I liked the color but the underskirt is short and it‚Äôs very tight fitting. Doesn‚Äôt feel particularly classy or modest.<br /><br />May be good if you‚Äôre very skinny.,0
1,Arrived with most of the eyes floating around in the bag. I guess it‚Äôs to be expected for the price,0
2,Ordered the black. Looks like a dark gray. Not high waisted. Weird fit. Looks and feels bulky.  They are super warm but not worth it,0
3,tbin material,0
5,I needed something to keep my cloth mask off of my face.  This becomes a major issue as I have to walk through my facility daily and it becomes difficult to breathe.  The frame fits nicely inside my mask and my ability to breathe has improved.  You do feel it against your skin when you first put it on but after a while you do not notice it.  Sometimes when I am talking it does get caught under my jaw and pulls but that is very rare and not very annoying.  Most of the time the frame just slides as I talk so it does not get in the way while still keeping the cloth off of my nose and mouth.  All in all it does what it promises and I will buy it again if needed.,1
4,Nice although the navy blue is hard to tell its not black,1
5,Just what I was looking for.  I bought this for my friend and she loved it.,1
5,Great quality and detailed very colorful,1
5,I ordered a size small and it fits like a medium but over all it's nice material and im excited to wear it out,1
5,Love it,1
5,"I was looking for a comfortable yet stylish pants to wear to work and on social occasions. This pant did not disappoint at all. It fits true to size and really comfortable! I received so many compliments, I have to purchase more. You can dress it down with a flat or a heel.",1
4,It had plenty of room for everyday items and was easy to use with multiple pockets for various items. It is well designed.,1
4,Works well at keeping pants from falling down :-),1

She is 5'6"" and weighs about 95 lbs...tall and skinny (aka HARD to fit!) she is also about 90% leg so most pants don't fit her (already in long length jeans).<br />These pajamas fit her very well, they are perfect lengthwise as long as she wears them on her hips instead of her waist and they are cute even she, as a near teen that suddenly hates everything she once loved ;), loves them.",1
5,Beautiful rose gold accent,1
4,"It looks so great and the size is perfect for my daughter , but the plastic is so light and poorly made it could break by dropping a soccer ball for instance. I would not buy it again.",1
2,Wore out in 4 rounds of golf,0
4,"My husband wears a 13 wide shoe. He likes to wear socks even with his slippers and these fit him. I ordered the size 13. The toes are a little tight but I will just use my shoe stretchers on those. Otherwise, he is happy :)",1
5,My daughter told me I needed something to wear over my bathing suit.  She sent me this site so i ordered a navy blue in size medium.  I usually wear a a size 8 and a medium was a perfect fit.  It's something different than a cover up.  I have had a lot of compliments.  I would recommend this.  We live in Texas and we swim a lot.  It will be perfect when we go to Mexico.,1
1,"The fabric is very nice, but every single sock developed a hole within 2 months of infrequent wear.  2 of them had holes when we received the product.",0
2,they turned red within two weeks...poor quality!,0
3,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, but one arrived broken. In the return process now. Will be reordering",0
5,Quality socks and Made in the USA!,1
3,it's a little bit wide - so probably a good fit for a more muscular or bigger boned kid,0
3,Based on the sizing guide I expected it to be less tight. It‚Äôs very fitted.,0
5,A+,1
1,Wrong dress,0
2,"They look nice and the material is ok, but length and waist size are off for me.",0
5,A great product üëçüèº,1
5,Pretty,1
1,Poor material and has no shape to them,0
5,"This dress runs small! I am standard 2x (18/20) top and bottom. I ordered this dress in a 3x and it was still a but snug. Probably not best for anyone over a DD cup, I wear a C and had plenty of room, but this is not a stretchy material. That said, this dress is BEAUTIFUL! I wore it out for date night with my boyfriend and I felt so gorgeous. Of course it's an off the shoulder so it rides up some, but not any more than any other off the shoulder dress. Super minor inconvenience.",1
3,"very small, but nice",0
5,It says Penn State what else is there.üòÅ,1
2,The pants were incorrectly sized and were two sizes to small.  This was to be a Christmas present. The pants were to small to pull up past your knee's.<br />The color was luxurious. Almost mink like. Very soft to the touch.,0
5,So soft but leaves fuzzies everywhere even after washing!,1
1,Awful! Zipper came broke and the colors are not the same as show in the picture. I returned it the same day I received the purse.,0
2,These boots run small. My toddler wears size 7 but I ordered a size 8 just to be safe. They were still too small so I have to return them.,0
5,Thank You,1
1,"When I pulled the item from the bag, I was shocked at the size of the armpit holes...an entire family of raccoons could fit through the holes.<br />Seriously?<br />Toddler size?<br />I don't think so...",0
2,"As soon as I saw the boots I asked my son NOT to wear them outside on the farm. Could tell that they were definitely NOT waterproof snow boots. Said that he could wear them as church boots. Second time wearing them at church (on carpet, inside) the toes tore up. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for the cheap price.",0
5,I love the bag .I was so excited to get it,1
1,It broke the first week i had it....,0
5,It is a great suit - excellent quality just fits a little more snug then I expected.  Maybe should have ordered a size up.,1
3,"I thought these were a cotton blend, idk if I read the description wrong or what but they are all spandex tights so I gave them to my 11 year old lol",0
3,"The outer leather separated from the inner lining after only three uses.  I have another belt from the same manufacturer that is holding up nicely with no issue, but this one did not last.  Otherwise a nice looking belt.",0
1,"Should have fit is way too small, I sent it back",0
5,"I just received the tanks and was surprised the fit was perfect. So first, I'm 6'4' 230lbs. My chest is a bit saggy from being over weight for years as a child/young adult. I always wear tank under shirts for to reasons. 1. They cover up a bit of the saggy chest. 2. They absorb sweat. My chest size is 42'' and I like my under shirts to be a snug/tight fit. The under shirts I've been using are cotton and while they absorb sweat well they loosen up over time. I purchased these because they're compression tanks and hopefully won't stretch out, time will tell and I'll update if they do.<br /><br />To the size. Their chart would've had me purchase the XL. Again I like my tanks snug so I took a flyer and went down a size to the L. They're perfect! Snug but not over snug and the best part for me anyways is, being tall I need them to be on the longer side and these are. No problems at all tucking them into my boxer briefs.<br /><br />Being I just put the tank on 10 minutes ago I can't speak to the sweat issue our durability but I will update.",1
5,"This flag charm is as cute as can be!  My sister saw mine and ordered one, also.  The charm is shiny and well-made.",1
1,They did not come straight. They were bent and then I had to fix the nose piece. I can‚Äôt wear them now since they bent and can‚Äôt be straightened back out. Worst purchase ever,0
2,Ran small in the bust area and material felt weird... the print is beautiful but the color was off I couldn't tell if it was a greenish grey,0
4,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and these are the XL. They are a little long on me but I still think they are cute. Love them. This is my 2nd pair. The 1st pair the zipper broke, but i was sent a replacement fast.",1
4,very cool,1
3,I'm a 31 waist.<br />These are super cute but the fit is weird.<br />I ordered a medium. Back is leaning towards being cheeky and front has almost same cut as the back...<br />Quality seems to be ok,0
1,Way too small and are much shorter,0
3,"This item is ok. I don't like that you can see right through it, but other than that I love how it fits and the dress flows very well.",0
1,CROSS SLIPS RIGHT OUR OF THEINFINITY  LOOP..JUNK!,0
3,"The shirts was super cute. The fabric feels nice and soft. However, the shirt Runs small. Returned both  of these shirts. Reordering them again to pack on cruise.",0
3,I have a small head and these don‚Äôt stay on my head.,0
1,This product is super cheap. The material is horrible. It's not even cotton. I washed it on cold one time and it already started pilling. Save your money.,0
5,So nice for a birthday queen,1
1,Picture was a bit misleading.. but still liked it,0
5,Exactly what I ordered and can‚Äôt beat the price $43,1
1,Rough material and moderately uncomfortable.,0
2,"Really pretty items, but a few of them have pointy edges that dig into the sides of my navel. Also, the largest one is quite heavy.",0
5,Nice,1
3,"Very comfortable, but I normally fit in a 3xl and that‚Äôs what I ordered and it was to big! Would recommend going one size smaller!",0
1,this looks better online.  the material is a yucky feeling material.,0
2,"I wish this ring could be resized. The website did not establish what size it was, its too small for my finger. but its cute, which sucks.",0
2,Really cute in the box but not on me,0
2,Too small for average size man,0
5,Nice especially for the price,1
5,Very high quality fabric and the design was perfect.  Colors were true,1
2,Shipped wrong size. Too small. Did not have liner. Way to thin materiel. Waisted a lot of money here.,0
5,When I opened the package I was surprised at how much it weighed.  I was looking for something warm and this filled the bill.  It fit perfectly.  I was happy that the collar covered the back of my neck.  The only negative for me is that it took 2 weeks to arrive but that doesn't reduce the rating of the jacket itself.  I would buy another one.,1
1,These ARE NOT for adults. Maybe for a toddler to wear.  So tiny you cannot hardly see them.  I returned them the same day they came in.,0
4,I like them - but they are tight,1
5,"This review is for Hafmall 6-Pack Baby Bandana Bibs for Drooling and Teething, Baby Bibs with Pacifier Holder Leashes for Boys and Girls Gift Set (Nautical). These bibs are by far the best bibs we have used! We love the size and shape of them and that there is a pacifier holder on it! They all have very cute patterns for a baby boy. The bandana style is also a lot cuter than a typical large bib. We have found we like these more than any other bibs we have. I think they are absorbent and practical. The price is also great at less than $10 for a pack of 6! We will be ordering more of these!",1
1,Do not like how these close on ears. Don't feel they will stay on my ears securely.,0
3,Ok,0
5,REALLY WELL MADE LOOKS GOOD TOO,1
5,I loved the earrings,1
2,"First, I received an XL in black as opposed to the S Navy. Amazon immediately sent out a replacement, which to my amazement was totally different from the first dress I had received. The hemline is all over the place; below my knees in the back, shorter in the front, lower on the left side, and the right side is cut up to mid-thigh with a slit to the top of my leg. I should have sent it back, but figured I'd just wear it as PJs. On the upside, the fabric is soft, but it is fairly seethrough.",0
5,Had two very emotional kids when they received these keychains.  Well worth it.,1
1,terrible product,0
1,Really not satisfy with this.,0
1,These bracelets might fit an infant.Way too small for any High School Graduate of any size.Probably wouldn't fit above a 2 year old.Very dissapointed.,0
3,"The print and styling for this bikini is awesome but it runs small and the top has an odd fit. The bottoms were much smaller than the top and usually I have the opposite problem with suits because I have a larger top than bottom. None of the straps are adjustable so that doesn't help with fit. I ordered a small and I am 5'1 120 and a 34C and the top was somewhat small and the bottoms were tiny, but fit how I would want them to if I wanted a cheeky style. I would recommend for someone with a smaller build and who wants a more revealing look. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.",0
4,perfect for my needs,1
1,The item doesn‚Äôt look like the one on the picture. Came in without a box a the feeling of the belt is like plastic instead of leather.,0
2,it had no support for my DD cups,0
5,"I'm 5&#34;1 and weigh 150 pounds, ordered a size small and it fits me perfect. The material‚Äã isn't too thick or too thin, it's just right. Will be buying again.",1
5,Beautiful necklace! The blue and copper are great together. Perfect for the summer and whenever you need a summer/beach vibe pick-me-up. It arrived when expected and in great condition. Highly recommended.,1
5,Very easy to launder and they look great.  I got more than one of them in different colors.  I love them.,1
5,"I absolutely love this top. It's flattering, fits well, is comfortable, and soft. It's not too warm and the sleeves have just the right amount of stretch. I typically wear this on the airplane since it's so comfortable. I wash it on delicate and hang dry. I've had it 3 years and it's kept up. I finally ordered two more tops since I wear it so much.",1
5,These are small but absolutely perfect size for my 5 year old.  Very cute!,1
5,Fits great after washing and drying,1
2,They are very silky feeling.<br />They are easy to snag.<br />I'm on the chubby side and they bunch up uncomfortably around my ankles.,0
5,they are RAD.  I look gnarly.,1
3,Pretty color but very cheaply made.  I‚Äôve bought better at the Dollar Store.,0
2,Too small.,0
1,"It would be 0 stars. Bought for my daughter for Christmas. Broke as soon as she put in on, like literally as soon as she put it on",0
3,Soft material. I bought my usual size L but it was too small.,0
5,Very sleek and macho,1
2,"This dress is a great color and material, but it IS NOT wearable without leggings or shorts.... the slit is so high and right in the middle...with one step anyone in front of me would have seen my panties. The material is such that any pin or stitch to keep it closed would be very obvious and not look good.<br /><br />I also agree with others who said the belt loops are too big and too high.  For the belt to cover the waist line steam, it has to be at the very bottom of the loops, and then it inevitably rides up a little. And for some reason the loops are about 3 times bigger than they need to be to fit the belt, which looks a little weird in and of itself.<br /><br />Overall, I can overlook the belt loops, but would not recommend it because the slit basically makes it unwearable.",0
5,Good wrist band and comfortable. Looks nice and gets attention.,1
5,Very beautiful!!,1
5,Fit perfectly,1
1,Horrible product!,0
3,Picture shows unique color. Mine is navy. I like it enough not to return it.,0
5,I m satisfy . All of my junior bridesmaid was beautiful for my wedding,1
4,"Great product all together , size ended up being smaller then expected",1
5,Love these socks,1
1,To thin and see through,0
5,Looks great!,1
5,These shorts are a great deal! Nice thick fabric that fits my 5-year-old with a bit of room to grow. Great deal with the add-on program!,1
3,The pattern is a bit &#34;fuzzy&#34;.. but still pretty interesting.,0
3,It's OK but very bulky.  Could be streamlined.,0
5,"I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it. The sweatshirt is high quality, fits great and the graphics are beautiful. I would definitely recommend it.",1
1,I just received the pants in white and black. The white ones are very see through! (horrible) and I didn't like the material it's that type of dressing shinny material no cotton at all!! The strings on the pants are very cheap too! Js.,0
5,The best in every way!,1
2,"Sized up from L to XL (5'7&#34;, 155lbs.) This fits very oddly. I don't think I have even worn it once.",0
3,I like the material and quality of the product. My and my wife both tried it and not sure how it would reduce waist size. It's comfortable and would help you in setting you up with good back posture.<br />I was given this product to provide honest feedback.,0
5,Perfect !,1
5,Great shoes for the price. Thank You.,1
3,Item was much smaller than expected.,0
3,"The dress is very cute. I had problem with the zipper. It hit stuck by my waist. I had to invest in a new zipper since it got stuck and when it went up, got open!",0
1,"The first time I wore this necklace, it turned black and turned my neck and blouse grey.<br /><br />I wanted to return it, but because I didn't try it on until after more than 30 days, I wasn't able to.<br /><br />Then I tried to email the business to give them a chance to make it right before complaining, only to get the email back marked that the email address was no longer any good .<br /><br />So I'm stuck. The way this is made, you cannot just slide the pendant off of the chain; however, I will have my hubby try to take it off and forge a way to put it on another necklace, that is if the pendant doesn't change to black as well.<br /><br />BE WARNED - IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY!!! ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE SELLER!",0
1,Hat was too small. I ended up giving it away instead of returning the item.,0
5,"I love this scarf!  It's very pretty,  you can't beat it for the price. I have received so many compliments, very attractive.",1
5,Easy to use. Works great,1
1,"Do not buy this item. It runs very small, and you have to pay overseas shipping to return.<br />The return it costs almost as much to buy.",0
1,Product was scratched all over watch face,0
5,my husband loved it. He said that it feels good on.,1
1,I had ordered two hoodies for my son and he is a big boy however he want it a black and blue like showed on pictures but we received a light gray and light blue color. No where near the colors I had ordered. It clearly showed black and dark blue like navy but oh well I am guessing faded means gray and light blue.,0
1,I ordered a XXL but the sleeves and shoulders were way too small. I couldn't fit my medium sized arms into the sleeves and even if I could I wouldn't have been able to get my shoulders in the coat. I was very disappointed that it didn't fit because I really loved the style.,0
2,"These shoes feel like fake plastic toy shoes. They do look cute, but they weigh nothing.",0
3,"I like this dress. It's a little looser in the chest than I would like. I felt like I was constantly readjusting it. But it fits great everywhere else. Next year, I'll just wear a camisole underneath it.",0
1,Nunca me llego y solo se que me encantaban,0
5,Beautiful and great price. Did a lot of looking before buying this one.,1
5,"Very nice, better quality than expected for the very low price. Love it.",1
5,"These earrings are so awesome!  The green & gold sparkle really compliment each other.  For me, they are the perfect size for my bottom ear hole - either alone - or with a little gold accent in my second hole.",1
3,"Would have been a 5-star, but....The &#34;artwork&#34; is not centered with a slight tilt.  Didn't notice it until after I washed it and wearing it the first time under a sweat shirt.  My bad.  Just look for the image alignment like I didn't.",0
3,"after it aired out a few days, it was O.K.",0
1,"They refer to this as a &#34;modesty sock&#34;---so when I walked into Starbucks wearing one,  I was unprepared for the reaction I got.  I now have to register as a sex offender and my wife has filed for divorce.",0
5,Si est√° muy bien,1
3,product was larger than expected did not fit,0
3,Small but cute,0
1,"The picture looks purple but it‚Äôs actually more pink. The fabric is cheap, thin, and unflattering. I‚Äôve rocked several similar pants like these before, but this one looked all wrong. Poofed up in funny places, I couldn‚Äôt find a flattering way to wear them. High or low. Maybe I got too big a size for my frame (I‚Äôm short, five foot two) or maybe the crotch is a little too long for how short I am. I was disappointed because the picture was exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôd look for something with more starchy fabric. And if you‚Äôre around my size and tend to get mediums for fitted clothing, get a small for something baggy like this. Good luck short ladies, it‚Äôs tough to find keepers!",0
5,Love these hats not to big or small fits great.  Nice material,1
5,Clasp works well. Easy to put on,1
1,Bought these because a youtuber recommended it (Tiffani Beaston) but they are horrible!  I bought a small because I‚Äôm rather petite and they are huge of me!  No support!  Learned my lesson - don‚Äôt buy something just because a youtuber endorses it.  Going back to my Walmart brand sports bras!,0
3,Backpack was damaged,0
2,"The headband itself is nice. However, the one I received is very pink. Not mauve at all.",0
5,I thought it was a bracelet but I love it.,1
4,"Super cute, but more pinkish than red-- Which I actually preferred and chose because of the reviews. I ordered a size bigger than it suggested, and it was still a little tighter than I'd hoped. It still looked amazing!",1
5,"I was looking to replace an old favorite pair of lounge pants that are no longer available from the manufacturer. Although the material is thinner and has slightly more Lycra, I'm absolutely pleased with them. My old pants served me well, but these are an awesome replacement. They feel great against my skin and they're really comfy.",1
3,Somewhat small but not bad and for the price it is hard to beat. Perfect for the summer-lightweight and comfortable.,0
5,Very nice and comfortable.,1
1,"I am 5'8"" and 150lbs - this was far too short, and also too big around the stomach. Sizing chart was very off.",0
5,"Ice Rhodochrosite  ‚Äì colors are a touch darker than pictured, but I have a new favorite bracelet now.",1
5,Super soft and comfy,1
2,I actually ordered this twice. The sizing is crazy. Once its on i found it to be bigger and it just didn't fit the way i expected.,0
5,Came on time. Wood quality,1
1,Pure garbage.  By the time I was asked to write this review the watch had already been in the trash for days.  One piece came off and that triggered the rest of the pieces.  Obviously. It was put together by wishful thinking..  I can't por a zero I supposed because it's not worth 1 star. A kids play watch is stronger.,0
2,Wasn‚Äôt cut out all the way in some parts,0
5,Great for playing Viking. Son loves these.,1
4,"Nice quality, looks practically unbreakable and isn‚Äôt too heavy. It‚Äôs a little short at 17‚Äù but perfectly usable.",1
3,Fits good,0
4,Run small.  I brought  two size bigger.  I recommend these socks when traveling.,1
5,The fit is great and they are warm.,1
3,"It is black and some of the inner white material shows on the chest part of the bra, so it makes it look kinda cheap. Also, bottoms are a little tight and gives the ""Miley"" look on your bottom. Also the white liner fabric comes out of the bottom of the bottoms. I bought the small and I am 5'2 and 115lbs",0
5,"I love these pants and have purchased several pairs. They have a cell phone pocket in the front waist band, which I love. They are also great quality.",1
5,Great material.,1
5,"Hat fits as expected.  Nice quality, prompt arrival.",1
1,Not happy at all the fad and stone come off,0
1,"Horrible quality, paint came off within a couple of hours",0
1,checkerboard cushion was ripped when we opened the package. very cheap cover on it.,0
5,Keeps the water out even in heavy rain,1
5,"I bought these for Christmas after seeing a coworker wear hers in silver for years! I always complemented them so I finally gave in and treated myself. What a cute little touch of the holidays, not overly in your face but just a gentle touch. I also received many compliments! Would make a great gift to someone else or yourself!",1
1,Poor quality  and the size was not an adult size  type of lanyard to go around the neck there is no safety release  and the screen  silk screen printing is very poor is wish it was more heavy duty. Not recommended for mature men in our fraternity.,0
4,Love the pattern and the zipper is good quality. Wish it was a little bit stretchier considering it‚Äôs supposed to be neoprene but it‚Äôs still nice. Great value for the $,1
3,Color fades away quickly,0
5,"These are as large as advertised, and a quality product. I was pretty impressed!",1
2,"It's okay, has a dumb pocket but just okay",0
1,"The posts and backs were black. I was hoping it was just silver tarnishing but when I tried to polish them, they stayed black. The picture is after polishing.",0
2,"With a name like G.I. Jewelry you would think this is a man's size item. Not going to bother sending it back maybe my niece, or sister will like it. The chain is very cheep looking, but the charm is nice, so deserves more then one star.",0
1,"""you get what you pay for"" ‚Ä¶ while the ring is ""cute"" ... it's honestly a piece of cheap junk.<br />the ""metal"" band bends and warps easily ... the white ""sinestro corps"" logo is REALLY off center and it's barely visible in the bright yellow center button ‚Ä¶ AND after only 10mins of wear and the button edge catches on a desk top and the logo button pops off and the ring itself bends.<br />so for my $6.99 i got 10mins of wear and something to throw away.<br />IMO, don't waste your money on this thing. i just ordered a MUCH nicer one for around $20 w/ free shipping.",0
3,Nice looking clover and the resin is holding up just fine. But the metal on the back is wearing off. Pretty sure it isn't stainless steel...,0
3,Too large,0
1,"Good quality glasses, very well made, but unfortunately I don't see any better with them on.",0
1,"You get what you pay for, and that certainly applies in this case.",0
3,I look like a fat pilgrim. I‚Äôm small (shoulder to shoulder I‚Äôm 11 inches) but have big breasts. The<br />front has a collar that drapes over which doesn‚Äôt flatter big breasted women.<br /><br />Fabric is a bit stiff with a little amount of stretch. I was hopping for a softer silky feel.,0
5,Great socks,1
5,"Shirt looks great. Colors are vibrant and I usually wear a large, I purchased a large and it fit perfectly.",1
4,"Nice but very delicate and looks like it might break easily, but very nice design",1
4,"decent quality for the price. The heels are only about 4.5 inches, which is a bit lower than I was expecting. I added protector caps to the heels and had to super glue a portion of the sole back on. But for such a low price for a nice pair of kneehigh boots, I'm happy with the purchase",1
1,not a good product at all.,0
2,"I loved the color and the style, I'm typically a size medium in these type of dresses but the black piece of stretchy material below the breastline was soooooo tight.  Apparently order a size up...",0
5,Seem fine so far.,1
3,Got a M but the top is a little tight across the bust. I'm 36c hope this helps,0
5,"These T-shirts are amazing for summertime, or in my case California. They‚Äôre on the thinner side=breathable, the sleeves are the perfect length (not too short or too long), and have a relaxed fit. Best shirt ever",1
5,It's actually beautiful but Not what I wanted... I wanted a plain one not a FLOWER GIRL printed one. I never opened I will be returning,1
1,"This is way too small to be a woman's 3x. I couldn't even get it over my chest and I measured myself before purchasing, not to mention the cheap material. This is made to fit a 12 year old and it does. Not for an adult and should be labeled as such.",0
5,It fit perfectly,1
2,I wouldn't buy it again. The thermal sleeves are alright but the gray part with the Lucky logo seems cheap and thin.,0
3,Arrived extremely wrinkled. And is 2 sizes small. The quality was probably good but  hard to tell because of the wrinkles.,0
1,nowhere does it say it's silver and the cat is crooked,0
3,The color and texture is beautiful. It runs a little small but is still flattering.,0
3,"Fits nicely, but the material is so cheap looking I was a little taken aback when I received my order, simply because A. The color isn‚Äôt the same as the photo and B. The quality looks a lot nicer in pictures lol. Overall it‚Äôs cute but eh. Thin material.",0
4,"Very very thin, but quite comfy üíñ.",1
5,Just what I wanted.,1
5,"Soft material , correct fit, looks good",1
5,Very cute dress. Fits my daughter perfectly,1
5,&#34;Great shades&#34;,1
5,Works great!,1
5,Love the fit. And look and fabric. I have a very small wrist and this fits great. You can adjust it too.,1
2,The shoes are adorable but so cheaply made. The bottom peeled after the first wear and the photo is after three days. Maybe ok if only wear indoors or for a special occasion otherwise pass.,0
5,This brooch is so pretty and it is everything that I expected.,1
1,I ordered a large although my size is M but still its too tight to wear. I cannot even wear it.,0
1,To wide,0
1,Runs HUGE.  Clasp doesn‚Äôt stay closed.  Elastic fraying after ONE use.  Total waste of money.,0
5,Love these!  They fit perfectly!,1
4,I ordered a XXL and it fit like a large: it‚Äôs defiantly cute and delicate,1
4,Great sweater.  It was as I expected. Good quality material with tight stitching.,1
3,"It came on time for my sister's christmas present and the outside is adorable! The ear doesn't pop up but I don't really think that aspect matters. The inside of the bag is super thin, made of very cheap fabric. It makes sense for the price but kinda of disappointing. Not sure how long it'll last her but she loves it.",0
5,It‚Äôs a perfect match for<br />My other stuff. I‚Äôm<br />Sure my friends will love it too when I give them this for their birthdays,1
5,great for sports and recondition your shape after loosing weight so you wont look wabbly,1
5,"Really loved it, but just a little to small for me. Gave it to my grand daughter and she loved it.",1
5,This stylish and comfy oversized top looks and feels great. I love long tops with leggings or tight jeans and this one hits the mark. Soft and surprisingly slimming. True to size but remember it is a loose fit. Size down if you want a tighter fit. I highly recommend you give this one a try!,1
5,Great product. Very comfortable.,1
2,"This brand runs too small. I had purchased another suit, same barnd, and picked the ize I wear and it was too small. Thsi time I went up a size and the suit is still too small. The arm holes are also cut really samll. This feels more like a Juniors  suit and not an adult suit.",0
5,"Amazing value, functional, speedy delivery.",1
5,"I love them, fit well they are very soft and thin. Great for workouts or just lounging!",1
5,"perfect as described, fast ship",1
5,Very comfortable,1
4,Very pretty. Would be 5 stars if there was some elastic in the waist. Still pretty nonetheless. Got lots of complements.,1
1,This dress was intended to be worn for an event the same week of the purchase. Package arrived in a timely manner. Size was as expected. Zipper broke when my daughter tried it on. Poor quality zipper.,0
2,"I liked the dress, but I have to get it  altered underneath the arm area. The gap there is so large I can't wear it.",0
3,"Quiero este vestido desde que lo vi, pero cuando lo compre gui√°ndome por su gu√≠a de medidas, obtuve un vestido que solo cubr√≠a la mitad de mi. Fue una comple decepci√≥n. La tela no sede para nada pero sigue siendo hermoso si compras la talla correcta no dejaras de usarlo.",0
1,Nice and soft but first time I wore them there opened up a hole in my big toe .  Thought they would wear better than that.<br />Just got out of hospital so could not get out to return them. Would not recommended.,0
1,"Chain arrived already broken into small pieces. Since I had planned this for a Halloween costume, it is too late to order another for my purposes. I'll take the hit. Do not recommend.",0
3,Nice,0
1,"HORRIBLE!<br />After this review. They still have yet to contact me about replacement! I have sent emails requesting one as well!<br />Cannot see buying from Amazon, if they cannot confirm legitimate sellers with good ethics for customer service!<br />The quality of this wallet is very cheap. The zipper has some kind of rust or some damaged wear? It doesn't zip open and closed properly. Overall, extremely dissatisfied. This was supposed to be a gift to my husband, but there is no way that I would give this to him...",0
1,The bathing suit is a gift for my daughter i am giving it to her when i go to VA. I just opened the box and to my disappointment it is black instead of brown.<br /><br />Kim N.,0

5,"I've used this on ebony, rosewood, pau ferro, and even an Indian laurel fretboard. Made a dry 40 year old ebony fretboard look and feel new. Pricey, sure, but I won't use anything else.",1
3,"This dress is lovely. The fabric is is rich with a soft hand.  It's shorter on my 5;7&#34; frame than I like, coming about 3&#34; above the knee.  It's obviously made for someone shorter.  The waist hits me mid-rib, but the flow of the skirt fabric prevents it from looking funky. The size is a good fit, just the length is off for me.",0
3,"I ordered a size bigger than I usually wear and it still doesn't zip, especially after I get anything in the pockets.  Like the color and the quality of the product. I wish someone would figure out that women have hips - they aren't built like men.",0
5,"Love this purse! It's easy to organize, very spacious and so pretty.  The straps make it so easy to juggle all my things in my hands. I love the color and size, just prefect",1
5,"These socks have a quality feel, nice and soft, stretchy, and didn‚Äôt lose their shape after washing.  The are comfortable and warm, and fully cover the calf almost to the knee, so perfect for your outdoor winter activities.",1
3,Small! Be careful. Order up for sure!,0
4,my grand daughters look so cute in them.  a color for every outfit,1
5,"People are saying that the lace is cheap but as far as I'm concerned this lace isn't cheap it's strong so where it won't tear ,bought for my daughter she just loves it she's a 34 a so that's what I bought fits her perfect .....",1
3,No room for a d cup chest,0
1,From seeing the picture of the sweatshirt to what you get is 2 different things,0
5,"I love this mask cause of the black long feathers  the black and silver mask with very beatiful details,  I gave it to my friend for her August masquerade mask party and she loves it. Its a very beatiful mask she'll be the envy of the party.",1
2,"The embroidery on the dress is beautiful and it is well made.  The downfall, it is so wide.  I wish it didnt have so much lining and pockets , they make it wide and frumpy looking.  I am 5'6 and 140lbs, I ordered two of these in size small. Sadly I am returning them.",0
5,"I bought the dark green and the color looks a bit bluer than it does the picture, not quite as vibrant, but the fit is great. I bought a medium as I wanted it to be a bit more flowy than tight. Fit is great. It looks good paired with black leggings and I'm sure I'll enjoy wearing this through the fall!",1
1,My son put them on and ran to the other room. As he was running he slipped. The bottom is fabric. Took them off and returned ASAP. Who puts fabric on the bottom of toddler tennis shoes? Do not buy unless you want mom guilt for your child getting hurt,0
2,Not true to size ordered another tank from the same company for perfect this one was much smaller,0
5,So perfect Exactly as described!,1
5,Awesome product.  Large fits perfect I have a size 7 and 3/8 head.  Very comfortable and I wore it in a torrential downpour my clothes were soaked but my head was bone dry.  Also I love that I can just stuff it in my back pocket. Only downside is that I have a beard and people have taken to call me 'Castro' or 'Fidel',1
5,Perfect,1
5,great fit and look,1
5,Great purchase and the price is unbelievable.  I have purchased multiple sets,1
1,Comes unclasped! Fell off my arm and broke my watch! Very disappointed,0
5,I like,1
5,"I am in love with these bras.  Lightweight,  supportive,  all around awesome. I have a bad shoulder and how a bra sits on that shoulder has the potential to be wicked painful.  No problems with this one, and the straps are adjustable to a length I need.",1
1,"Very disappointed,  i thought its a good one",0
5,Great fit.,1
5,Amazing beg!! It holds so much inside of it!!<br />Very comfortable and affordable<br />I recommend,1
5,I gave this to my son as a gift.  He loved it and it has held up well.,1
4,"Very cute boots, they run a little small. I wear 8 1/2 but I ordered a 9 after reading reviews, and the 9 fits perfect. I roll down the top to make a cuff that shows the furry lining and they aren't tight at all, perfect fit. You might need to put some inserts in the insole, as it isn't very cushioned.",1
5,This is nice stone,1
4,Great size to fit all my stuff. Nice knowing the safety and security features it has. Only one thing I sort of don't like is that the material is kinda shiny. But the good far outweighs that.,1
3,It did not come with a extra battery as stated in description. The clock itself is not of great quality.  The locket is good quality and is well made. I took out the watch and put in a picture and bought a better chain and it was a great gift for my wife.,0
3,Muy buena tela pero me quedo un poco suelto esperaba me quedara ajustada un poco pero tiene buena calidad volver√© a comprar gracias,0
3,Se enrollan muy rapido,0
5,I just got this for my grandson for Christmas so I really don‚Äôt know much more than the description but my 13 yo grandson will love it.  He‚Äôll have to fight off Dad from stealing it! lol,1
3,"Fits my watch, but a little big on my wrist, just have to slide the watch a little further down my arm.",0
5,"Great quality, small post which is great for kids",1
5,Carpri is very comfortable. Band did not roll while sitting.,1
1,They‚Äôre pictures as ankle length but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and these were definitely capri length,0
3,On the cheaper side. Good for a costume,0
3,I love the design of this cap but it doesn't have the usual adjustments strap in the back to make it work with a variety of head sizes. It seems well made and the design is better than most cadet caps but the non-adjustability was a deal-breaker for me.,0
5,"Exactly what it said it was, came in a very timely fashion and was adorable! I use mine as a car charm and hang it from my rearview mirror!!",1
5,"Love these!  Not too oversized, seems to be made well, lightweight, nice dark lenses, very comfortable.  I have a tendency to pull sunglasses to the top of my head when I want to see something in natural light or if I go indoors.  I like that they don't have the nose grips that pull my hair out.  A decent prada dupe.  I like so much I just ordered a couple more in different colors and finishes.  For this price, I never have to worry about them.  Only wish they came with a case.",1
3,I wasn't unsatisfied but I was not satisfied either. The kimono was a bit smaller than I expected. Also the sleeves are not loose they have a cuff on the end. I ended up not wearing this.,0
1,Not worth it. The material is too thin.,0
4,"Good shape, looks good, but a little smaller than the number asked... Fits tight",1
5,I really like this face mask. I had one just like it and unfortunately I lost it.the colors are nice and vibrant. It‚Äôs very comfortable. I give it 5 stars.,1
2,The. gloves did not have enough fleece. They do not provide much warmth.,0
4,"These are a very nice weight sock, but the ankle part doesn't stay up well. Not much in the line of elasticity there and they tend to fall down into your shoe part way through the day. Frustrating.",1
1,"I bought these to match my son's dinosaur masks but I was really disappointed.  if the filter is in, it's almost impossible to talk because it's so close to your nose and mouth. Also, they are uneven. When I put it on it immediately feels uneven and uncomfortable. The part that goes over your nose that you should be able to pinch to fit your nose does not form to your nose and the mask keeps going into your eyes. These were a huge disappointment.",0
5,"Very pretty, great for a special occasion to dress up my Apple Watch!",1
5,My daughter is a huge Nightmare Before Christmas fan and she loves it.,1
5,I bought these for my husband and brother-in-law since they are big fans of the Blues Brothers movie.  I feel they are a quality for the price.  Both pairs survived a week-long beach vacation and occasional wear after that.,1
3,Like the designs.  Quality could have been better.  You can see the hot glue used and some seams were slightly torn.,0
5,"Excellent pair of sunglasses, great quality. This pair of sunglasses comes with a material pouch, also comes with a piece of material to clean the glasses. They are super cute for us girls and it has a way to open the sunglasses for people that have bigger heads. It has a gold frame with brown. They are sturdy and super nice and elegant. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a good quality pair of sunglasses. I was given a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />[[ASIN:B01F7OBQAQ Eason Eyewear Men/Women's Fashion Aviator Sunglasses Spring Hinge UV Protection Gold/Brown]]",1
5,Just as pictured and described. It‚Äôs very thick,1
3,It's okay. Not astounding sound but gets the job done. Only thing I don't like is others can here what I'm listening to,0
5,My boy looked so handsome :-),1
2,"Cheap plastic attached to the mask, it gets foggy. No good!",0
1,"My bracelet says ""I'd rather be watching The Hamilton"". However, it should say, ""I'd rather be watching The Hannibal."". I am not satisfied and would like it corrected as it is not what I ordered.",0
5,I love this cute comfy dress,1
5,very easy to use. And it works!,1
5,good for one time party only.,1
5,I love these socks.  I bought them for biking because their cool.  They keep my feet dry all day so I also where them to work.  People see my snazzy socks and think ‚Äòhe must be in marketing.  My son ‚Äòborrowed‚Äô a few pairs for work but now wears them to school.,1
5,True size I love it,1
5,Love the texture quality and design looks pretty,1
1,I liked till it stopped working cause a fan propeller came out and stop fan from working,0
5,Good boot looks extremely nice got many compliments,1
5,"Solid cheap glasses, used for a hippie Halloween costume worked out great.",1
5,Fit my 6 eyelet shoes perfect nice heavy lace,1
5,Well made. Zipper makes it easy to get on and off toddler feet. Seem warm and comfy. My son likes them alot,1
5,I got these sunglasses for a Halloween costume and was pleasantly surprised how great they are. They‚Äôre stylish and seem high quality for the price.,1
5,Great glasses for faraway monitor. Big help. Nice and quick transaction.,1
2,I purchases this shirt and a couple of Columbia shirts to take on a trip to Europe to hand wash and dry quickly.  The first time I washed it in like warm water ALL of the button holes frayed and I could not unbutton the shirt.  I spent the rest of the trip leaving it buttoned and pulling it over my head like a T-shirt.  I was totally disappointed with this shirt.  The Columbia shirts did not have this issue.,0
1,"The soles on my old boots had worn through, and since I walk a couple miles each day to get to and from work I needed a new pair right away. I figured that since I had more pressing expenses at the moment I could pick these up on the cheap, and they'd tide me over for three months, by which time my other matters would have been settled and I'd have saved up enough to buy a quality pair of leather boots that would last much longer.<br /><br />Well, after one week and perhaps 10-15 miles of wear, the soles have begun separating from both boots. These things won't last me a month, let alone three. If you just need some stylish, thick-soled slippers to cover your feet while sitting on your rear, these are probably fine. If you need something that will actually carry you reliably and comfortably to where you need to go, don't bother with them. These things are barely fit to be called &#34;boots.&#34;",0
2,Really cheap looking like plastic,0
1,"[[VIDEOID:267fbe3c547a58184bc842fa482dc34b]] It's cheap material right down to the ribbons dangling from pockets. If your a spandex wearer this is for you. If you wear better quality clothing do not get this. It's not cotton. It's spandex with a zipper. Don't at all believe it's worth $35 bucks. It's one of those swap meet outfits where they try TY charge you $20 for something that will be destroyed right after you wash it. üòí  OK so for size if you still wanna buy it.. I'm 5'10, 215, 44DD, no tummy, thick thighs, wide hips, & a sort-of booty... don't judge me ha ha ha anyway...I got an XL I could have got the large for a super tight look but the Xl was just tight enough for me. It's a bit itchy so a soak in fabric softener could help with that. It did not go all the way to my ankles but I was gonna wear boots with it. Returning it.  Hope this helps your choice.",0
2,"Case colors are as shown.  Glass frame colors are muted and more orange than pink.  Christmas gift for my daughter.  If she doesn't like, I will return.",0
5,"I was very impressed with these. I have a collection of antique cuff links from my dad and was a bit worried about the quality but needed a pair in the rose gold coloring. I love these. They are definitely not the quality of the antiques but well made. Weight is nice, good mechanics and nice shine. I will be buying other color and patterns from this company.",1
4,very rich looking pretty,1
4,Great size and colors!,1
1,"I decided to return this instantly after I opened it. The material was not what I expected. It was stretchy, similar to gym clothes.. if that even makes sense!",0
1,"The color is lighter than the photograph. The print is an appliqu√© on only one side, and it's coming off in pieces.",0
5,"I purchased 2 of these for my parents who honeymooned near Nubble over 40 years ago.  My parents are impossible to shop for, but these were a huge hit!  In addition to the pretty image on the front, the masks are a nice quality and very breathable.",1
5,I  love it,1
1,Immediately shrunk. Terrible material,0
5,"Bought it for my gf as she loves to go fishing with me, do things in the yard, etc...while still ""looking cute""  as she always says LOL  So a hat she could put her hair up and keep off her neck was a discussion one day.  Surprised her with this and she has not taken it off all weekend.  Great buy and the criss cross style allows her to wear her pony tail high or low.",1
5,use them every day under my cycling helmet,1
2,It was fine but... honestly not flattering to any body type. I tried to donate to several friends of different sizes and shape. Looked like crap,0
4,I love this belt and cannot wait to wear it again.  It goes with so many things. Thank you!,1
5,This anklet is so cute and so comfortable. Adjusts for smaller or larger ankle size.,1
5,"This shirt is going to be the new staple to my wardrobe.  It is so soft and will be great paired with shorts for summer, jeans and a jacket or sweater for fall into winter.",1
3,Didn't realize when I ordered that there was a pentagram in the center. If I had I would not have ordered the necklace.,0
5,"They look just like I hoped they would. Just the right size, nice color. Perfect.",1
1,"The material is good and thick.  I bought my daughter size large and this one seems to look like an extra small and one of the arm openings looks like a size extra large , the other one looks like an extra small . This was badly made.",0
3,Great looking but runs way to small,0
5,Very pretty chain!  Sturdy for use with larger pendants.,1
2,I was trying to find lightweight glasses that didn't make any marks on your nose and from the reviews I thought this was it-but no they are not. They make marks on your nose and they are very flimsy and lightweight. I would not recomment.,0
5,cool,1
5,I love these socks. I read the reviews before purchasing. They are such a good deal. They're good quality and comfortable. I recommend them and would buy them again.,1
5,"I like it, but it‚Äôs already coming apart",1
5,Ordered a medium but I usually wear a large or xlarge in blouses or dresses.  It fit perfectly- not too tight and not a tent! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and the length is wearable - not too long. Barely touches the floor.  The fit is perfect. Shows off your silhouette tastefuly .,1
1,"Way to small, add another 3 inches to the size",0
1,"first item came defective - very low quality plastic bladder that leaked a lot of air along the plastic seam.<br /><br />in addition, the flag does not stand up straight like in the picture.<br /><br />lastly, there are no instructions on how to rig up the clips and string, and i cannot figure it out even after the seller sent a thirds party youtube link of a different float setup altogether.",0
5,Great socks wear them to work and they don't slip down.,1
5,Great quality!,1
5,It does fit snug but thats kinda the point because it helps to make you sweat. With using this and doing keto I've lost 20lbs!! I wear it when I go to work or work out and sometimes weelar it underneath my waist trainer so I can sweat more! Definitely love this product!,1
3,Kind of tight,0
1,These are huge. Wont wear them,0
3,I don't like the material of the sewn in under shorts nor do I like the way it looks so I will likely remove them and wear other shorts when I wear this.<br /><br />It's not incredibly flattering. Bunches around the crotch and tummy. The top part is not flattering to your breast. I am a fan of this style of the ruched stretchy material. I have a dress made completely of it and it's flattering because it's sewn in a way that curves around and accentuates and is flattering..<br /><br />This just missed the mark for me.,0
1,this is the ugliest &#34;Moo Moo&#34;  skirt I have ever tried on!  I should have listened to the reviews.  When it says you look big trust me they are not kidding.  I am a size 16 and i have big hips.  Boy did it ever accentuate the hips!  EWE.  It was pretty on the page  but unless you are a size 6 dont buy it.  I returned it and they refunded my money,0
5,The vest worked very nicely and the size was perfect fit.,1
3,Unfortunately the watch started becoming delayed shortly after purchase. Changing the battery didn't work to fix it. I really liked it before that.,0
1,This nose screw was painful to get in because it is at a direct 90 degree angle the edge is not curved to help with ease to get it in. Going to ask for a return/refund.,0
5,Love it,1
4,Comfy and fit perfectly.  The brown ones are a great shade and stay in place during my workouts.,1
4,Cute shirt but be aware it runs small.,1
1,The earrings are very thin! The earring post broke the same day. I do not reccomend this to any women. Definitely not worth the price!,0
3,"I love the design. It was exactly what  I wanted. Unfortunately, the leather dye rubbed off on my skin. Because of this I'm not sure how often I will wear it.",0
5,As expected,1
5,Second time buying this belt. I bough it in white. Good quality. I am thinking of ordering another one in a different color. I recommend it.,1
1,I wore it for a week and it broke and i almost lost my watch,0
1,I would recommend this shirt to anyone the image on the shirt is blurry and of poor quality. I ordered a kids medium and it was way to big. This item is not a good buy,0
1,"I really thought for the price I'd be getting better quality eyeballs.  I was a little shocked at how small they are and that they were not a full eyeball, but just a half eyeball.  I'd send them back but they would charge me shipping!",0
1,It oxidized and started turning green. Wasn't expecting much so I wasn't surprised.,0
5,Granddaughter loves it,1
3,Like the shoes but one strap was not seen to the shoes. They are not yellow but more of a butterscott,0
2,"My son loves it, but the little piece of metal that holds the tooth broke within a week of my son wearing it. Now I‚Äôm going to have to try and drill a small hole in it so i can run a chain through, so he won‚Äôt lose the tooth at recess due to poor quality materials.",0
5,Great for the price.,1
2,it's broken after only 1month of purchase. Poor quality,0
5,"Soft, good quality shirt. Not to thin or thick. Perfect summer shirt",1
5,"Love these shoes, they fit my size 5 just right. I like that they hold my heel in place. They are light weight, which feels good on the feet.",1
1,"Center links came broken. Thought I could just wear it anyways and still have the triangle bra look, but it doesn't fit right. A little lopsided. But you get what you pay for. Maybe next time I'll opt for the $20 body chain.",0
1,"I usually wear a L or XL blouse. I ordered a XXXL due to reading the reviews of &#34;smaller than expected.&#34; Well, that was a major understatement. This might fit someone who wears a normal M.<br />It's also very flimsy",0
5,Bought it for my Granddaughter for Christmas and Mommy let her open early. My granddaughter loves it!! It was a little big not too bad and she where's 5t or a 5 small in girls but still worked for her.,1
5,love it. Fit him perfect,1
2,"Arrived damaged... Pulled out of the package with a huge snag right on the butt section ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I can't even try to work with it , it's too noticeable . Too bad... wanted these. Will be returning",0
5,Good belt,1
2,"I really wanted this watch to be nicer than it is. True, for the price, it‚Äôs not too bad. However, it doesn‚Äôt live up 5 star reviews. The watch looks descent enough but the drawbacks outweigh the looks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Not overly expensive.<br />2) Looks descent<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) Heavy<br />2) The instructions do not match the watch<br />3) The second hand cannot be stopped when setting the time<br />4) Changing the date reveals that the movement is cheap, the button is pushed and the resulting movement is awkward and you must click through a date of 39<br />5) I cannot read the day of week nor the month (If that is what the other dial is) as the letters/numbers do not have enough contrast agains the background<br />6) I have serious doubts as to this watches durability.",0
3,Material wasn't as i expected it to be. Kind of shiny. Flowers look bigger also. But still can be cute,0
5,Love these tops,1
5,"Terrible product. One of the bands didn't even fit/hook into the watch. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Edit: Upon posting my negative review, I was immediately contacted by the seller and they shipped me a replacement for free. The new one fit perfectly and it works very well. Great customer service.",1
3,Looks great but the orthopedic Support is not there at all. The sole is thin and weak so the feet hit the ground and get tired easily!,0
1,El producto es de muy mala calidad la tela. Parece tela impermeable. No lo recomiendo.,0
2,I wanted a smaller size. Tighter fit on my head. It‚Äôs reall huge.,0
1,Would give it no stars if possible. Fell apart all the time.,0
4,"Super soft and comfy, but really long. I‚Äôll need to hem them but it‚Äôs worth it.",1
5,Sleeves fit as expected but not very long on the torso.,1
2,Not the length as pictured nor the quality expected. Almost a sheer material. A bit disappointed,0
1,"Didn't want a bell, not a happy discovery.",0
5,"Comfy, light weight, and great to wear under my work shirts.",1
4,It fit good üëç,1
5,Fits and looks as advertised and is very stylish and comfy to wear. Would recommend,1
4,"For my wife, this dress was too small in the hip area, pear-shaped, usual size 18. Otherwise, she would kept it.",1
5,These are just like my $150 frames! I love them :),1
2,Runs very small. Couldn‚Äôt return because it was ‚Äúused‚Äù since it was attempted to put on.,0
5,"I am 5'2&#34; and 130lbs and these fit awesome! i recommend them to anyone. they are thick but not like thermal winter wear, but they totally could be used during the winter too.",1
5,Elegant and stylish,1
1,The fit & material is bad -  made so many request for pick up but no one turned up,0
1,Way too small to fit over your foot... No stretch to it.  It's now a bracelet,0
3,"At 5'10, 135lbs, this item in Medium is both too large and too small.  It's slightly too short for my tall frame, and too baggy around my back.  It's not &#34;bad&#34;, but not great either, and 100% wearable with smart pinning/alteration.  The color is nice and the fabric is good.  It hangs at/above my knees.",0
5,"Cute, nice quality and comfortable!",1
5,I am 4‚Äô10‚Äù with a petite structure. Adult Size Small Gloves are generally too long in the fingers and make knife work during food prep a challenge. These fit just right. I use them for at home food prep and some crafts.,1
5,Love them! Can't best the price. I literally wear mine every day,1
5,I bought this for my friend for Christmas n she loved it she said it fits great now she does wear a small but she likes her sweaters n bath robes a little bigger so she‚Äôs in love with her new sweater,1
5,"I love the way these look, and they're great for mid-season when it's not very cold, but not warm wither - spring and late fall. Keeps the chill off without overheating. They are well made with quality fabrics and look great for casual or also dress up a top and skirt for work or a night out.",1
3,It fits baggy and little long. Although I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5.,0
4,It is very pretty.  I ordered a size up and it was still small.  I like it and hope of lose weight to wear it.,1
5,Fits good. Soooo soft and comfy.  I have big b**bs so maybe size up if you got that issue too.,1
1,No tags. Arrived in a clear see trough<br />Crumble bag . Looked like a used item . No tags .<br />Unable to gift for Xmas .,0
1,Shirt came delivered with a huge grease stain on the front. Took 1 and a half weeks to receive. Disappointing as this is the product I really wanted.,0
4,The size was completely off so I had to give them to someone else so I am writing what they said about the shoes. They absolutely love them and wear them on a regular basis not just when around water. They also said they are extremely comfortable. I just wish I had some that fit,1
2,Would order a size smaller next time<br />Great otherwise,0
1,TERRIBLE LEGGINGS! These were not at ALL what the picture was like. I had ordered these because I saw someone recommend them on TikTok and I did not get the leggings they got. They are a very baggy material with loose stitching. There is a right band around the waist. Such a disappointing purchase,0
3,The sleeves fit very tight.,0
1,Received order today and it came missing the clip to attach it to the watch leaving it useless.  Not happy.,0
1,"As usual, Chinese-made companies stealing American intellectual property and selling poor quality knock-offs (in this case, TREX Arms). Skip this, support American manufacturing, and buy once cry once with something that wont fall apart.",0
3,"Doesn't keep you very warm .... Fine for moderately close weather but if its really cold, this cannot help",0
4,"I like it, its pretty and the quality is not bad. It does run a little big , I should of gotten a medium.  I am 5'6 and weigh 160 that should give you and idea.  It is loose but I will keep it, because I am using it for vacation and I don't have the time to wait for a different size.  I believe it runs true to size. So if you are normally a medium no need to size up.  I listened to order reviews and order a size up, there is no need for that unless you are bigger at bottom or top, because it doe snot have stretch.  If you weigh more than 180 I wouldn't get the large, I would get an x large. Hope this helps ladies.",1
5,Awesome! Been looking for something like these every time I go shopping! Love them,1
2,"First, my dress does not look like pictured.  I bought the blue and white.  At the bottom, they show the models legs showing through -- supercute little detail.  Mine did not have that cut out stripe along the skirt, just a cheap band of blue around the bottom...  Also, material of the dress feels cheap and a little nasty against the skin.  All in all, not my fav.",0
1,They run very small. Like 4 sizes too small.,0

2,Does not fit as picture implies.,0
5,I love this dress üíñ .Perfect fit I will recommend it.,1
5,"True to size. Light fabric, good for summer. Lovely color. I want another one in other color",1
2,"Very comfortable however, thinner than expected, no pockets of any kind. Would not use for workouts, rolls down will not stay up despite high waist, and a bit long so if you are on the shorter side (I'm 5'2"") there is excess fabric.",0
5,Too CUTE‚ÄºÔ∏è,1
2,"The docks look nice bout will never know how the feel, wear or perform.  I wear a size 7 women's shoe and the socks are about two inches too long from heal to toe.",0
5,This is a cute shirt fits as expected. Great gift fir a Milwaukee Bucks Fan.,1
3,"They feel very cheap and flimsy, I've seen dollar store glasses that looked nicer.  If you just need them for props they would do just fine. If you wear pair, they won't fit ella.",0
1,Too big,0
5,same as ray ban,1
5,I got these as a surprise for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them!!!!  He gets compliments on them all the time!!!,1
5,"My son loves these, very well made and comfortable!",1
5,Beautiful charm,1
1,"Mine faded the 2nd time I wore it, just from wearing it!  Also got it wet once, and the chain and all tarnished!  I won't buy from them again.",0
5,Very comfortable!,1
2,"I bought this because the shape looked like something that wouldn't show bra line, unlike a lot of pushup bras where you can see the top seam. It definitely shows through. Not only does it show, but it's lumpy! The lighter top piece is very thin compared to the darker padded area, and the result is that both parts show through my blouses making it look like I've got that quadraboob thing when you wear a bra that is a couple cup sizes too small.",0
5,This was my first day of school dress and I got so many compliments and questions where I found it.  It was seriously so comfy that I think I will have to get one in every color.  Only thing that would make it better would be if there was pockets. üòä,1
5,Great price for quality product.  Prompt delivery.,1
5,Being old people what else can I say - Excellent!!!,1
5,I had to fluff it back up after its arrival (it came vacuum sealed). But after that it fluffed right up!,1
4,"i wish i had ordered a size smaller, but otherwise a cute top!",1
1,Don't buy these gloves it tore up in a few hours I'm going to submit pictures later horrible low quality I could hav bought this for 99 cents By ery disappointed Unfortunately I have to give one star or if give no star,0
1,I ordered a 2XL. I really take a XL but I like the extra room. Way too small; gave it to my 13 year old son.It fit him.,0
5,My sister is a nurse and she loved this bag.,1
3,"very cheap material, runs larger than other chinese clothes online.",0
2,"Way way too big, I'll be returning",0
4,"No water bottle holder, but tons of pockets, average size, like an average purse, it will work well.",1
2,These where simply too small,0
5,my son likes them,1
5,Love them,1
3,Unsure as to why the band is so long. Fits more like a bracelet than a watch. The watch itself is Beautiful and durable,0
5,For the price of this suit I was super impressed. The material is perfect and the fit was as expected. I am 5'6 and 150lbs and I ordered a large and it fit me perfectly.<br />I would recommend this suit especially for how cheap it was!,1
1,"DO NOT BUY.<br />These are VERY short cuffs, these are NOT as shown in the images.<br />These are NOT 8.6 inches, barely have that length!",0
1,"Great product. I have several in rotation on my Seiko divers!<br /><br />Addendum<br />My watches now fall off without notice. This is alarming to me. I treasure my watches and cringe at the thought of one dropping and breaking or God forbid, going down an abyss.<br />The prong slips out unexpectedly from the buckle, especially once it gets wet. This is unacceptable.<br />I just received new Natos from another company.",0
5,"Cute, comfy and practical.",1
5,"Bought it for my aunt, she loved it !!",1
5,Fun and worth what you pay for it,1
1,The XL was like a small and very cheaply made.,0
3,Smaller than I thought. Sent it back!,0
1,Pretty dress but made me look too boxy and the buttons on the side stuck out no matter what size I tried.,0
1,"It was way too big (ordered US size 12), but it's easily a plus size shirt.",0
5,"Absolutely in love!!! Fit I‚Äôd perfect, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 135 lbs 38D chest and ordered a medium and it fits perfect. Not too tight but overly baggy. The material is so very soft I was pleasantly surprised!! I most definitely will be ordering again!!!",1
5,Just ehat we needed,1
4,"Love it, I‚Äôm a size 14 and 5‚Äô5,  Fits perfectly. Very comfortable. Material is a little thin but a good fit.",1
3,"I felt it looked better online than in person, because I am a Saints fan, I will not return it, but it is very masculine in person, and not as feminine as I thought it would look.",0
5,"This purse is so cute! It has good quality and is exactly how it appears in the photos. I was worried the strap was going to be too long, but there are many adjustment options. It is the perfect size to fit my iPad and use as a carry on bag. I love it and definitely recommend!",1
5,"I bought this for Halloween, and I really enjoyed my gypsy custom, I got many complements good ones off course",1
1,"Ok, for one this looks like a completely different sweater than the one I got. The design was good. But the it is not a regular THICK CLOTHED SWEATER. thats what makes me mad because its not going to last long now and the one in thepicture looks like a long quality sweater but the one you get isnt.",0
2,"Not a fan of the material, looks and feels like a cheap Halloween costume like texture. The color was off as well.",0
2,"I love the look of these swim shoes. They look like real sneakers. I wear them in the pool with my kids. However, I only wore them 3 times before hoes developed at the toes. I am disappointed.",0
5,"Love these. They feel awesome. Usually a LG, so I bought a large, just a bit snug. Traded them for an xl, and love love love them.",1
1,If it had fit better I would have kept it - it was tight on butt and big around legs.  Didn‚Äôt like the fit on me but of looser on butt would have liked it.,0
2,it looks like the picture but the ring is very cheep it is so thin i'an afraid to put it on it might bend would not buy it again. Michael,0
1,"After only 3 trips, weight not exceeding 45 lbs, this's how your front wheels are gonna look like. The main problem isn't wheels, but that now the suitcase is open because cheaply made plastic felt off from the suitcase with a wheel. Pure garbage.",0
1,Broke within the first 20 min he had it out. He 9 so it wasn‚Äôt a matter of him mishandling it. This was a matter of poor quality product. Definitely was NOT worth the money.,0
1,Really nice jersey and material but run toooooo small,0
2,"Colors were fantastic, but quality was very very low, wore out first day on the reef.",0
1,cheap,0
5,My husband gets so many compliments on this! He has had it for a year and it is very sturdy!,1
1,"Ugly, stinky,and sewn as if by a 7yr old. Probably was sewn by a 7 yrs old in a Nike sweatshop in Vietnam Nam. Nothing good to say here",0
5,She loved ot!,1
3,Tight in sleeves and bust,0
2,I LIKEED THE COLOR.<br />THE EARSOCKS ARE HARD TO REPLACE AND THE NOSEPIECES KEEP FALLING OFF.<br />I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE.,0
2,"Definitely not for larger breasted women. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 190lbs with DDD cup size and where the shorts of the XL fit perfectly the bra top was another story. The coverage was decent, but the actual straps were so thin that where you‚Äôd like them to at least pull your chest up a little to look cute the weight of my chest almost seemed that it was going to break the straps they were like floss in terms of thinness and quality. I did get a pair of cute shorts out of it though. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a two star and not a one.",0
5,"Loved this necklace. Wore it the night I got engaged. However, it got caught in a dresser drawer accidently and the chain snapped. Would recommend, just be careful as chain was extremely fragile.",1
1,Did not like,0
5,"This is the most awesome swimsuit.  It fits adorable and the quality is outstanding, especially for the price.  I couldn't believe it!  Do watch the sizing when ordering.  I wear a size 8-10 and saw that I needed to order the XXL which I don't typically wear. But ordered according to their size chart and it fits perfect, just as they described.  They could easily charge twice the amount, and the swimsuit would still be worth it.",1
5,I liked the boots.  They were just one size too big.  Exchanging for a smaller pair.,1
1,Just a sheet of paper.<br />Two tiny eye holes.<br />Absolutely no use for a costume.<br />Not worth a nickel.<br />How can they justify this?,0
5,One of my favorite !,1
3,I just wore a pair i'd bought last year.<br />My hands were FREEZING in 35 degree weather.<br />1.  Material is thin<br />2.  Cold air cuts into spaces in the stitching<br />3.  I have my doubts that this is 100% wool.<br />They would be good under wool mittens or gloves<br />to add extra warmth.,0
1,"Worse pj's  ever, returning  cheaply made and arrive way to late",0
2,"Ridiculously small. And rather than support, it just smooshes your boobs down so flat they can't go anywhere. Very little, if any stretch, and certainly not a full support bra - unless you consider duct tape full support.",0
5,Perfect Fit and looks cute on grandson!,1
5,In this pandemic...you need this.<br />I love my hat with shield...<br />I cant breath with those tight masks on..hasslemof removing to talk...<br />No need with this..,1
1,"The watch would not even start. So, wasted money, time and disappointed child. They are criminals for selling it.",0
1,This jacket looked more like vinyl than leather. I was disappointed. I will return it.,0
5,it's so awesome to get to harvest your own pearl. i love these. i've bought many of them over the years. these make great gifts.,1
1,It is not linen..,0
3,"Better than many other strapless bras I‚Äôve had in terms of comfort, but I‚Äôm disappointed that the strap in the front does not really have any real function.  It provides little to no lift.  Just adds bulk, which I would tolerate if it served the function, but as is it‚Äôs just a negative feature.  I was really hoping this was the one.  Heavy sigh!",0
1,I ordered a larger size and it's to small in the arms. The length is too short,0
2,"Because the size is too small, very different that the reference table. I'm disagree with the product",0
1,Size is a children‚Äôs size and completely wrong,0
5,"This is the softest, most comfortable dress I've ever bought. It's extremely flattering and has POCKETS. I'm wearing one of the white prints with nude heels for the rehearsal dinner at my fall wedding. I would easily wear this as a wedding dress if I were having a casual ceremony, that's how much I love it. LOVE.",1
3,"this is exactly what the hubby wanted but after just a few wearings (he does have a big head) the material is seeming to turn in on itself and the white insides are starting to poke out the black print..... it looks ok still, just little white fuzzies all over it but wondering if there is a better material?",0
2,They are very cute and super lightweight however the brown pair are two different earrings. One has big dots and one has tiny dots. The grey pair has damage on the bottom of one. Disappointed with the quality.,0
3,Straps are smaller than expected. They are better for wallets.,0
3,"Did not fit the way I expected....I wish for more movement as a woman who usually wears Medium sized shirts. Picture makes it look a little longer at the hips than it fits me. If it fit like the picture, I would give it 5 stars since the quality of the zipper and cloth is really good.",0
2,"While I liked the look of this swim top, there were issues. I am small, 5'3, 110 lbs, 36B, and usually a small is just right. This, however, was too big with no way to make it any smaller nor could I exchange for a smaller size. I was disappointed, especially after waiting over 2 weeks to receive it. I didn't know it was coming from China.",0
5,My daughter loves them!,1
2,Thicker than sperey laces. Difficult to thread through jokes and tie to lay flat.,0
4,Great watch!,1
2,"Came smaller than the &#34;Large&#34; on the label, then shrunk after the first wash. I will probably have to donate it after the next wash.",0
5,"Beautiful! Good quality, 100 % satisfied! So happy!",1
5,Loved it ! For the price no one would believe it ! I bought a more expensive one but !! this one surpassed it ! It shines dainty but oh so pretty . Lobster claw and goes with everything you wear I recommend this necklace 100 percent!,1
3,nice,0
5,My grandbaby wore the slippers for the first day or two. I think she doesn‚Äôt like the tags inside. I will cut them down to see if she‚Äôll wear them again.,1
1,Broke within one month of having it. Band is stiff.,0
3,"Did not like the material, the area where a bit tight to body gets kind of see through and not looking good.",0
4,"It fits good enough to keep. Not very flattering for a smaller chested woman, as the bust part is big, but still looks cute. It will be my wear around the house suit.",1
5,"Nice watch...the band is very soft. It looks like a watch more expensive, it was a great deal!!!",1
1,Don‚Äôt bother. Within five mins of owning them the jewel fell right out. The hooks for you ears are also incredibly shallow making them hard to put on. The gold was also flaking off when they arrived.,0
3,Bought as a gift from my husband. The top surprisingly fit well but the bottoms where really really small. Adorable bathing suit for someone smaller.,0
5,"I bought this for my husband, for our 5th wedding anniversary and he's in love with it! Good quality, easy to set and nice to look at!",1
5,Need an Elsa wig? look no further. Super fast delivery and excellent quality! Love it!,1
2,I don't normally do reviews but after two purchases gone wrong here goes. These shoes are cute but the quality could be better. They took a lot of short cuts. The ribbon isn't sown on the ends so it frays. I had to use matches to seal the ends. I used a crochet hook to thread the ribbon. The holes were punched so the thread for the crocheted heel started to unravel off the shoe. Use extreme caution with this part. The strap that goes around the ankle does not hug the ankle right. No matter how tight you pull the ribbon.... Which is flimsy so don't pull too hard. The ribbon is also short! Doesn't have the flowiness like the pictures show. I'm going to purchase something different to replace the ribbon. Don't feel the shoe was worth the money spent but I'll make it work. I don't expect them to last long as they'll probably fall apart after a few wears.,0
3,Watch looked ok but the design is cheap. It partially broke not long after I got it and now has broken completely.,0
5,Famiy loved watch design. I hope to use for long time.,1
4,Excellent warm hoodie- great for winter. More like a sweatshirt than a thinner fashion hoodie. Color is quite a bit brighter than pictured- I like the real color better than the one in the picture.,1
5,These shorts are extremely soft and comfortable just like my sweet pants.,1
2,I NEED TO RETURN THEM. WAY TOO SMALL.,0
2,Cheap looking but the wife wears it,0
2,"5 out of the 6 are just what I wanted. The sixth pair with the lion unfortunately came in considerably smaller than all the others and the elastic band on one of the socks came ripped. I‚Äôm not happy that I can‚Äôt use one of the pairs. It seems like they need some quality control on their products. That being said the cartoon designs on them are cute! If the sixth one had been right I would have been happy with my purchase, but as it stands I will not be ordering from them again.",0
2,"This dress, while pretty, but was not like expected. The underskirt was too short so your but sticks out. The entire dress was completely see through as well. Great if you want lingerie, but I thought I was a dress so I got a refund.",0
5,Fits great,1
2,"I was disappointed with this hoodie. It is SO cheap- the fabric is very thin and only helpful in the air conditioning to cover your arms.  The fabric is also this almost scratchy material so it isn't soft at all.  Has a little bit of a weird shape to it.  The zipper works well and it's fine for just putting over your arms, but won't be wearing this much.",0
2,"Based on the reviews about sizing, I ordered my normal size because I did want it to fit more snug. It is definitely on the small side, but not uncomfortable. Material is very soft and light just like I wanted. The zipper is crap. It catches horribly going up and sounds like it‚Äôs going to break, however unzipping it works fine. I just wanted this more for knock around not actually physical activities so I got the quality I paid for it seems.",0
5,I love it. Fits great. Thanks,1
3,Like the look but runs small.,0
3,Its pretty but if you are an older woman order 1 size up.  OK for teens with great legs.,0
3,"The pink is not as pretty as photo. I'm 5'ft 7""  211lbs. I ordered the 3x based on reviews bit it was too big plus it has stretch in the fabric.  An xl would have been the best fit. Have to get it tailored. The length was perfect. Also the fabric is too soft for a jeans type. pants",0
5,Photo doesn't do this justice,1
3,My daughter loves them but the day she wore them the lace holder came out. Hopeful the next pair I buy will not have this issue. Returning them abs buying again.,0
3,Product arrived broken/missing stones...which is ashame because they dont hurt my ears.,0
3,I could barely get the bands into the first hole to put it on. Aside from the length issue its a great value for the money.,0
4,Comfortable shirt tough material,1
5,Looooovvvve this set. High quality. So stinking cute. Perfect for a little more coverage and modesty. So soft.,1
4,I like the color and lens is sharp!  It‚Äôs not super polarized but as a inexpensive replacement they are just fine!,1
5,"This is no J. Crew bowtie, but pretty decent quality. I'm picky about neckties, but this one is not too shiny, not too floppy, it ties well, doesn't stay wrinkly, and the size adjustment works nicely. I wore it for my wedding, and was very happy to find such a good product for the price.",1
3,"Although these moccasins are cute, don't bother to size up for your kid expecting they can wear them now, and still be able to wear them next season too.  They won't hold up that long.  I bought two pairs for two kids.  The inside fur sole comes unglued and drives my kid crazy, and the outside soles also came loose at the toe very quickly.  Ugh.",0
5,I do can‚Äôt wait to wear these items with my husband for our anniversary party ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
1,Super short & not flattering. I bought larges & that still wasn't big enough! Loved the colors I purchased but that was about it. One cold shoulder was bigger than the other & both larges didn't match up. Was even shorter. I returned and got my money back.,0
5,I bought this set for my nephews birthday and he loves it!,1
5,Dress is so perfect :) fits my daughter great,1
5,My brother loved it.,1
2,weak post.,0
5,I was going to a concert.  It was the perfect size to hold all I needed and was very comfortable.  Love how sturdy it is and it is really cute.,1
1,"The dress had a cheap feel. Did not fit properly, returned it.",0
2,"I bought a size smaller than what I thought I needed, and they're still baggy on me. Further warning: They're polyester, so unless you need them for cold Northern winters, these are not going to be ideal.",0
2,"If you have a GUT then order one size bigger. I did and was happy I did, otherwise your normal size would probably fit.  Collar is skimpy in size...doesn't ""stand"". The quality of this shirt is overall poor...fabric, tailoring, durability (I can tell it won't last). You better dry clean this one. The breast pocket is huge...big enough for two wallets. I'll wear it until I get sick of it, then give it to Goodwill.",0
4,Work fine but were too big for my glasses,1
3,"Very soft, but thin.",0
1,"Save your time and energy, DONT BUY! The material is extremely sheer and see though",0
3,It is a pretty little bra but is more like an XS instead of an Large.,0
5,Such a steal. I get tons of compliments,1
5,"Love these ankle socks.<br />6 pairs come in the package that hug your feet in the right places. The colors are the same as shown. ( I like the red ones, and so do my kids)<br />I wear a woman shoe size 7 narrow, my husband wears size 11W shoe, and these socks fit both of us, and the kids.(Go figure!)<br />There thicker after I put them in the washer and dryer, although there thicker then I expected.<br />I have more expensive ankle socks that are not thicker then these. For 6 pairs this is a good value.<br /><br />There great to wear around the house. Keeps our feet warm, but do not make our feet sweat. Are good with tennis shoes for the summer.",1
1,Wore once tossel already fell off and is fraying on the edges.,0
3,"This is my third pair of these same sunglasses. These fit differently some how, they are not as comfortable as my other two pairs that I bought at the coach store.",0
5,"I'm so impressed with these pants. The material is so soft, the fit is incredible, and they really do hold you in. I have pants from low end to high end brands and these are by far one of my faves.",1
5,I love it,1
3,Definitely size up for an oversized look or if you want to layer which I highly recommend because the inside is extremely scratchy!!! The outside feels soft (why couldn‚Äôt the inside feel like the outside?)<br />It‚Äôs by the brand SHEIN (there is a SHEIN tag on it) so if you‚Äôve ordered for them you know the quality is poor. The flannel is cute but not worth $40,0
5,Tons of braids. Beautiful work. Will last me a couple years.,1
5,Good item.,1
5,It's so cool I bought the blue one too!,1
1,Don't know how they would have fit-sine I had to return them.. They were to be a gift and if there was some kind of inspection then some flawless ones' could have been sent,0
1,"Did not look like real fur, poor quality and I returned.",0
1,Garbage  horrible material,0
5,Nice,1
3,I am 5‚Äô4 130lbs petite upper and muscly lower. A M bottom fit but top was too big.,0
3,The insoles is hard but overall they are comfortable,0
1,Do not recommend buying this chain. Very thin and flimsy. Missed my deadline to send bk for a return. Don‚Äôt waste you money.,0
5,Nice quality. Gave as a gift at Army Turning Green Ceremony,1
5,"Bought these for bridesmaids. They were super cute for the day getting ready, but the foam wears down VERY quickly. However, my niece wears hers constantly even after the wedding. The price is really hard to beat.",1
4,Nice set for the price.,1
3,I thought the fit was good and length was perfect. Unfortunately the color of the jacket was more burnt orange/orange spectrum than brown or khaki. Color is not pretty at least on my Asian skin tone. Will be returning.,0
1,Caution ladies!! They are not true to size!! I ordered a size up and they are like crop tops. They are definitely NOT compression tops!!,0
5,"Very pretty, can't wait to wear it!",1
5,This is a super comfy shorts/leggings combo.,1
1,Unfortunately doesn‚Äôt actually fit any glasses I tried 5 different pairs and the opening is too small!!! If I could give zero stars and still write a review I would!!! Super cute and useless,0
5,"I bought these for my niece, she was over the moon and told me she slept in them the first night she received them.  She would buy all colors if she could.",1
5,"I love, love, love this purse. It's extremely lightweight and it is waterproof",1
5,My little girl loved her outfit,1
1,Metal Clasp broke first month after purchase. Lucky a customer found my brand new fitbit 5 in his driveway and returned it to me,0
4,"The fit was fine for my big gord, 7 3/4. The hat is real dry. Rubbed mine down with hand lotion. Didn't over do it, just enough so you feel smooth coating not dry.",1
1,Horrible fit.  Might possibly fit my 6 year old.,0
1,Not true to size. Order one size larger,0
2,Way too small. Bought as a gift and was too late to return,0
1,Product was so small even tho it was supposed to be a large! Couldn‚Äôt get both legs in at the same time. Tried one leg and the pant leg was so constricted that I couldn‚Äôt pull up the legging.,0
5,"Like them very much, make my face bright up.",1
3,Sholder straps are too long. Cups are too low!,0
1,"Not good quality, not that stylish",0
5,Looks great.<br />Large bag,1
3,The shirt was fine but the material is like a swimsuit so I sent it back.,0
5,"Very pretty, very delicate. Appropriate price for the quality of the product. I do like it,",1
1,Way to small even for a kid,0
3,Size is way too small.. make sure you get at least a size bigger.,0
3,Picture is off center. Smelled like petrol out of the box,0
4,"5‚Äô4 185lbs and I ordered the XL<br />Lightweight sweater material.  The side pattern is a bit weird (it's covered in the model's photo), but that's not a big deal to me.",1
5,I just love how it looked on me. I'm ordering again but a size smaller...it just feels like it loosens up a bit,1
1,"This was the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.<br /><br />We used this luggage once and the biggest suitcase broke on the first flight of our trip to Morocco.<br />The suitcase was halfway filled (roughly 20lbs of clothing) as we were expecting to purchase a lot of things to bring back.<br />When we landed in morocco, the frame was cracked, one of the wheels was missing and the whole suitcase was unusable. Mind you, we now had to use this for 14 days and it didn't even survive being loaded onto a plane.<br /><br />I contacted customer service. They really did not seem to care. They offered to &#34;replace&#34; the big suitcase with two more smaller suitcases. When I explained to them that this is of no help (As we still have the 2 small ones and have yet to use them) and that we purchased this set specifically for use of the largest suitcase - they completely stopped responding to any emails.<br /><br />We're now stuck with 2 small pieces of luggage (that we cant trust to use) and a broken large suitcase.<br />It would have been more fun to light my money on fire than to deal with this crappy luggage and company.",0
3,"Feels more like nylon than cotton.  My feet get more hot in these than when I wear a regular, even thicker, cotton sock. Nice socks but I wish it had more of a cotton feel.",0
5,Fianc√© loved these. He‚Äôs a wrestling coach and loves his Irish heritage!,1
5,I absolutely love this dress. I get so many compliments when I wear it.,1
1,Different watch then what was on the picture! Feels cheap compared to the pics.,0
5,Good shirt to use as beginner cosplayer.,1
1,Not as described. It's very short. Should have been like the picture,0
1,"Boxey and loose, short and cheaply made, threw it away after 1 wash",0
1,very cheap,0
5,Simply beautiful,1
3,Quality is decent however they are too small. I wear a size 5,0
4,The material is thin and see through.  So it would be best to wear an undershirt.  A Large looks more like a Medium.,1
3,I just need to lose weight.,0
2,Small but okay,0
3,"I really liked the color of this dress and quality of the make/material. The heart buttons are super cute and the length of the dress is definitely in the 50s fashion which is what I loved about it. What I didn't like is that the belt was too long and the arm holes are small- it feels like my arms will lose blood circulation (and I don't have abnormally &#34;large&#34; arms). The dress is a very heavy material which I liked because I don't like feeling like people can see through it and the overall quality was done well- the seams and stitching etc were very consistent. Be prepared to iron this dress and probably will need a good ironing after every wash- and don't dry it. The part I dislike the most is that the buttons over my chest area feel like they will pop off. I typically wear a size 12 or large in dresses (175 pounds, 5'2, 38C) I do not have a larger bust area and can't imagine that women that do would be comfortable in the chest area with this dress. I really wanted to love this dress but did not feel as comfortable as I wanted to.",0

4,"Very cute design, but they damage very easily when scraped on the ground. The straps were quite tight and gave my child blisters around her ankles - they seem to have stretched out more with wear. They were the first pair of sandals for the year, but beware that they will show wear and tear. Good price, but you get what you pay for.",1
5,"This belt was much better than I thought it would be!  Appearance is great, it fits as advertised and it's quality is much better than the belt I bought at a major Men's shop.  I'm ordering another one!",1
3,"Well, I went ahead and bought and used this on my ear in spite of all the people out there saying DO NOT USE A GUN for cartilage piercing.  They may be right about that as I've never had a needle used in my piercings and I have a long ways to go to heal this new piercing without infection.  This was my first cartilage and my first &#34;self&#34; piercing.  The earring itself seemed a little wobbly when placed in the gun and that could be, but not necessarily, why the placement of the earring was off.  I wanted it completely on the upper cartilage area but it ended up going half into cartilage and half into the little lip around the upper ear (the helix).  Anyhow, that was good enough for me.  Amazingly it did not hurt at all during or right after BUT IT HURT LIKE HECK for two days afterwards. Red and throbbing.  Ouch!  Anyhow, it is now my third day and the throbbing has stopped and it is not as red.  But boy, it hurts to touch it even with my hair which I now keep pinned back away from the stud.  Am trying very hard to keep it clean and not infected as I understand it can happen rather easily with cartilage piercings.  At this point, the product did do what it advertised it would do although I only gave it 3 stars because of the wobbly stud.",0
5,"Fit really well, and these are comfortable.",1
4,Color and fit are both professional looking.,1
3,Good made Chinese band but runs small if you have bigger hands.,0
5,"Very elegant for the price. Upon handling it, I found that it was similar to costume jewelry. However, this cannot be determined by simply looking at the jewelry on a model. It has lasted me for over two months and is most definitely worth the price.",1
5,I followed the measurement guidelines and the dress fit as they said. The zipper is a tad sensitive because it's so small and the material on the dress is volumous around the zipper but the company did it to hide the zipper. I love my dress. I plan to wear it again. The arm cuffs are a little small but I just wore them closer to my elbow.,1
2,Watch is not a universal size and cannot be expanded - it comes with no extra links and seller has not responded to a request for extra. A shame as it looks nice but can't be worn.,0
5,It has a really clean silver look to it and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. The chain is rather short and can actually be shortened but it doesn't really bother me because I can still wear it comfortably. Love this necklace :-),1
2,"I ordered a small. My sizes are usually a small or 0/2 and I'm a 32B. Neither the top nor the bottom are reversible (the top is the same pattern on both sides, while the bottom is patterned on one side and can't be worn on the other side). Also, the bottoms are tiny. I am always a small (size 0 or 2) and I have average hips and the bottoms cut into my skin a little. The top is also different than the picture and skimpier as well. It almost looks like my boobs are going to fall out if it moves slightly. It's still wearable, but bad quality.",0
5,Love it fit my 13 yr old nicely she love it,1
2,"It's a good concept but not practical. It's gets heavy with just a cellphone in the pocket. I say heavy because You're wearing and carry your stuff around your neck. Also, the zippers are difficult to find and use, so you're fumbling with your scarf to find where the zippers are then where the tab to pull",0
5,My 13 year old daughter loves them. She thinks they are super cool,1
4,Love the print and the style.,1
2,"Pretty, but I wear a size 10 and the large was way too big. I just hate the hassle of returning.",0
3,"This is nice but smaller than I expected and thinner. Not very heavy.  However, it was fine for what I wanted and I am satisfied with it.",0
1,Garbage,0
3,This hat fits okay but not as shown.  There does not seem to be as much material to get the look that is pictured since it fit me more close to the head all the way around.  I kept it anyway.,0
5,It's adorable! The paws and legs are movable... cute. I bought it for my purse of the same color. Gonna get other for my collection of purses.... Lol.,1
2,I bought this hat a few weeks ago in preparation for my girlfriends birthday. When I gave it to her and she opened it up and the hat reeked of cigarettes. No one in my house smokes and I kept it in the plastic until I gave it to her. The quality of the hat seems fine but not thrilled at all with the awful smell.,0
3,Broke within 1 month.,0
5,The jacket is super cute and fits well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù with a slim build and the M is perfect and fits the whole length of my arms and torso. I went to dinner with a friend who was wearing a Lulu jacket in the same color and they were pretty much identical.,1
5,"We love Momo Baby shoes!!!!!! Fit well, and help her walk",1
5,Gift for an Aliens fan. She loves it!,1
5,"On my feet for work, but really don't like compression socks due to difficulty of on and off. These seemed to be easier to get on than others. I will buy more!",1
5,Very üôÇ,1
3,It got here quick and super beautiful but the earrings broke the 2nd day. The loop that holds the earring cracked.,0
5,We love it,1
5,My girlfriend absolutely loves this scarf.,1
5,"Finally! These fit my petite face without putting too much pressure behind my ears, but they don‚Äôt slip when I‚Äôm looking down. I‚Äôm an ER nurse, and I‚Äôll be sticking with these! Takes a long time to fog up, and doesn‚Äôt distort my vision.",1
3,"These sunglasses are not bad.  They do have an ombre type of lens (lighter at the bottom) which was not made clear in the description.  Actually, not much was clear in the description, but it was a fun read.  They also arrived in a padded envelope rather than a box.  I will probably give them away to someone who likes ‚Äúclout goggle‚Äù style, since I am looking for darker lenses.  The seller needs to get an English speaker to help with that description.  Seriously.",0
1,Way too small! Unless you have less than size 6 woman‚Äôs shoe don‚Äôt bother. These are child size socks!,0
4,"The color and fabric is exactly as pictured, which is very nice! This dark foresty olive green is beautiful. The pockets a nice addition, though the pockets have a very silky/polyester feel to them, and the ends of the pockets are secured to the poncho by a single piece of black ribbon. I'd be wary of placing anything too heavy or with sharp corners in the pockets. The snaps are a nice addition and allow you to subtly change the look of the poncho. You can make a short pseudo sleeve which gives you most of a silhouette, or leave them unsnapped for the true cloak/poncho look. Other than the ribbon on the inside of the pocket, my only complaint is the hood. While the entire poncho is a bit oversized, the hood is very small/short. The point of the hood is very short, so when I wear the hood fully on my head it sticks straight up. Wearing it only halfway on my head results in it sticking out at a 90 degree angle, giving me a triangle shaped head. When down the hood looks normal. I really wish the hood was larger so it could be worn without looking ridiculous, especially since it's so comfortable.",1
3,These glasses are okay but after 3 weeks the paint begins to chip off the glasses.,0
2,This does not fit my breasts and I got the largest size and it says it would fit but does not. Highly disappointed.,0
5,Looking forward to wearing it at the party I will attending. The shirt fits perfectly.,1
2,"One foot is larger than the other, very loose and hard to keep on.",0
4,"Love these. Only 1 pair doesn't fit as well as they should, but can't beat them for the price!",1
2,Cheap zipper broke before able to wear.,0
2,First off this is not the jacket I ordered. It is warm and does fit. But this is not what was advertised which so far is my only complaint.,0
5,Came as described. Pants are thin material. But good value.,1
5,"Loved the fabric, and the feel of it.  Size xs",1
2,The belt gave it shape and the purple color was pretty. I wore a slip dress under it because I felt like it was pretty see through.,0
5,"Great rehearsal dress! Make sure your nude undies match your skin tone, can be slightly see-thru in the sun! Love the fit!",1
5,My daughters loved it,1
3,The keychain looks pretty and will be a good gift to a new owner of a F250.  The mechanism works but is very stiff. It may loosen as used. Price-wise I am satisfied.,0
1,"The band is not all around houndstooth, only the front part (which looks ridiculous)  the rest is this cheap stretchy band. The quality is so POOR, it looks like a fourth grader did an art project.",0
5,Super cute! Wore them all day with no problems!,1
1,Picture on the left is the color blue that was described.<br /><br />Picture on the right is a ugly blue that I received!,0
3,"If you are not riding a motorcycle, they are great.  On the bike, the wind flips them up making them completely useless when they are most needed.",0
4,"I‚Äôm 147cm tall and the size XS fits perfect except for the sleeves are a little tight.<br />Other than that, the quality is very good.",1
1,I received the incorrect product. Not the one pictured. It was flared at the bottom and had a tie in back.,0
1,"You get what you pay for. This long sleeved t-shirt of a cardigan is cheap for a reason. Horrible quality, ran super small. It went right into the donate pile. Don't bother.",0
5,"Pretty impressive! Great fit for my wallet. A lot more windows than I had before, with room left over. My wallet is actually thinner now. The plastic seems pretty thick and durable, too.",1
3,Runs small but are great for sleeping in,0
5,"This bag is so perfectly useful that I have purchased it in three colors. I bought it in black about five years ago, and found that the outside open pocket was perfect for my cell phone (making it easy to grab and avoid a missed call), while the outside flap pocket was perfect for my keys (keeping them secure, yet ready when I need one of the attached membership tags). In addition, the bag holds soooo much (large wallet, bottle of water, all manner of paperwork, coupons, and receipts as long a your arm, makeup, an extra layer of clothing, a small lunch, etc.), yet it does not look like a huge bag, and it zips closed for security. The leather is beautiful, yet tough. The hardware is amazing, because when you have the bag on your shoulder, you can put your thumb through the large ring at the end of the strap, and the bag will stay in place at all times. Plus, there are no unnecessarily heavy and noisy chains, which I prefer to avoid.<br /><br />I used the black bag nonstop, and when the finish on the edges of the strap started cracking from so much use, I knew that I wanted more of this same bag. This khaki version is for summer, and I have acquired a new black one, and a third one in the coffee brown color to wear with a navy blue winter parka. The only issue that I have ever had with any of these bags is that the large metal zipper could stick a bit, and that was resolved by rubbing it lightly with a tiny bit of WD-40 on a Kleenex. It is my understanding that this bag is discontinued at this time, and I do wish that Michael Kors would bring it back, as it is a perfect design.",1
2,"Although these tags look really nice, they aren't durable enough for checked luggage. I put these on my luggage as soon as they arrived. I travel a lot for work. After my first flight of the week, the tag was bent in half. After my second flight of the week, it was bent in another angle. By the time I got home it looked like someone balled it up like a piece of paper. I would recommend this for carry on luggage only. The metal is too soft for anything else.",0
5,These seem to be good quality bandanas. Haven‚Äôt noticed any bleeding and they are comfortable. They serve many purposes.,1
5,"What an awesome title this is! The commemorative belt is the way to go if you're not looking to spend replica money. The strap is similar, if not the same as the replica. You cannot change the side plates, but I am completely fine with that. It is plastic but it is glossed over nicely and the buttons and end strap seem like the only thing that is steel based. Overall I am very happy with this title and totally recommend it to anyone in the market looking for titles.",1
1,"If I need a special tool to adjust my watch band to wear it, there is something wrong here. I want variety not to be a watch repairer. No time for mini screwdrivers and confusing directions. Promptly returned.",0
1,"Unfortunately, the quality of my belt was sub-par.  The buckle fell apart after only one month's use and luckily I was in the return period.  The part that failed was the thin screw/pin that held the buckle together.",0
3,It is beautiful shoulder bag but unfortunately the zipper broke and now it is a little difficult to zip and unzip my bag .,0
5,The masks were good looking and fit well!  A good buy!,1
3,Too short.  I should have read the specs.,0
1,It sheds fibers,0
5,My daughter loved this suit. Fits true to size and seems to be made very well! Great price for the quality.,1
2,Item is very flimsy.,0
2,Was not true to size I ordered a 2xl and it fit more like a L,0
5,"I wanted a shirt that I could wear after having my son and it's my go-to shirt right now. It's super cute, flattering, I can easily breastfeed him with it but I also know that after I'm done with that mama duties it's just a great shirt to wear in general. LOVE it and highly recommend!",1
2,"Beautiful looking dress, but very small! We ordered an XL and it looked like a womens small or childs XL.",0
5,Love these scarves.,1
1,These are huge!  I thought they‚Äôd be a cute addition for an outfit from the 70s.,0
5,Comfortable! Lots of complements!,1
5,Fragile but gorgeous.  LOVE!,1
5,"Haven't switched the bands yet, but the material is exactly like the stock one.",1
3,The sweater wasn't what I expected. It's a bit small even though I ordered a size up but the material is nice and soft. The image is okay but kinda smaller then shown in the picture. And the side sleeves are more at the back of the arm rather then the side... Idk how I feel about it. I wouldn't order it again but I don't feel the need to return it becuase it wasn't horrible...,0
5,"Good product l, I recommend",1
1,Don't ask me about this purse review because I didn't get the purse I really mad about purse,0
5,Perfect fit for a set of replacement lenses for my half jackets.,1
5,Shipped in great condition and was beautiful Thanks,1
1,Broke and couldn‚Äôt get a refund due to COVID returns,0
5,Wore to class reunion and got so many compliments on it and wanted to know where I got it. Will definitely top off your outfit.,1
5,"Great, stylish and comfortable! Great set of sunglasses for a great price.",1
5,If you're like &#34;maybe I shouldn't buy this purse....&#34;.... Buy it.<br />I love everything about it.,1
4,Shirt shrunk once I washed it. Besides that it looks great,1
5,"Don‚Äôt know why there are so many bad reviews. This watch is super pretty, Looks just like the picture, is soft, and is lightweight. A lot more comfortable than other nylon bands. I noticed it‚Äôs no longer available, which makes me sad because if I end up wearing mine out, I can‚Äôt get a replacement.",1
1,Too small for an adult and to big for a 4 year old.  I couldn't even get but one on my pinky. Gave them to my 9 year old. Wish they were bigger.,0
5,"Bought these for my daughter for a trip to California.  She loves the way they look and they performed really well on hikes.  Would definitely recommend- and the seller was great to deal with, too!",1
5,I absolutely love this PJ set . It‚Äôs soo sexy ! I wore it the same night that I got it . It fits my body perfectly and the material is a great . I can‚Äôt wait to get another one . If you want to look great in a PJ set well this is it ! I loveeee itttt,1
5,Love the variety üòç,1
1,The beige hat is much darker than the picture and it is not at all packable. It came out with a huge crease that only ironing will straighten. I am returning this item.,0
5,Great product!,1
2,The netting on these trucker hats is already frayed (had it for 3 weeks) and has the plastic liner sticking out of it which pokes the inside of my head. In general the quality/price trade-off here was not worth it. Pretty disappointing.,0
5,"So cute, item is just as pictured. I gave it to my sister-in-law for Christmas--she has only had it a few days but she said it seems to be good quality.  I examined it before wrapping it and it seemed to be well made. The item also arrived much faster than the estimated shipping.",1
5,I wore this dress for my nursing school pinning ceremony and let me tell you I felt amazing and hopefully looked just as good!,1

3,"Pretty color, kinda cheap.  It works.",0
1,"Stopped working within 6 month. Now I have to figure out if the company will credit, swap or repair. Prior to this recent malfunction the product worked fine.",0
1,Did not fit,0
4,We ordered the wrong size...,1
2,I was most excited for the purple and it really looks nothing like the photo.,0
5,Very nice top. Fits perfect!,1
5,Our son loves it.  It was a great buy!,1
3,"I was disappointed with this dress. It looked so funky on me, so I had to return it.",0
5,Esta bien construida buena calidad,1
5,I choose the dark ones bc of living in Florida sun.  They can be too dark (smoke/black) if it is not real bright out.  It took me an adjustment time to the dark lens because I never wear sunglasses.  I do like them,1
1,Did not fit had to return,0
3,"I really do love this bag! So I actually bought it to use it as a clinical bag for nursing school. I love that it has so many pockets, both inside and outside. It fits everything that I have to bring (which is a LOT). My main complaint is that the top pocket started to rip on the inside. So for example, if I put things (usually something small like pens or accessories) in the top pocket, it falls into the bag and then I have to dig to find it. I‚Äôve only used the bag 3 times so I was super sad to see the rip.. but overall I‚Äôm still super happy with this being the bag that I picked.",0
3,"Cute and very easy to slip on and off. The other reviews are correct though, the flashers at the bottom stopped working within a few days.",0
4,neck is wide. i want it to cover fully and had to sew it  a little bit to fix it,1
4,I ORDERED THE PLUS SIZE AFTER READING REVIEWS. THEY FIT LIKE A NORMAL L/XL WOULD WHICH IS PERFECT.,1
2,It's a cute shirt and all but the size runs way too small. Order a size or maybe even 2 so you get a shirt that fits.,0
4,"Decent quality dress for the price - light weight knit soft polyester fabric, decent print quality, adjustable straps, not too tight but clings enough to be flattering to most figures. Straps adjust like a bra. No complaints.<br /><br />5‚Äô2‚Äù ~130lbs, 36‚Äù chest, size medium fits and comes to mid thigh.",1
5,"I've bought tons of wristbands for my Galaxy Watch 3 and now that I have this one, I literally never take it off. It's so comfortable and cute, my other ones either can't be adjusted or the material irritates my wrist. This one makes it feel like there's nothing there, I live it. Also, who doesn't love leopard print?",1
2,Totally see through.,0
5,Super cute. Has that cute chunky earring look without being heavy.,1
5,"These might be hard to screw in at first, but they stay in place once screwed in. I have 9 ear piercing including 3 on the cartilage and these are comfortable to wear to sleep without the headache of trying to find a missing earring in the morning.  I haven't noticed any rust or change of color after wearing them to shower.  I would say they are great quality for the price and definitely one of the great buys on Amazon.",1
1,Showed up in pieces. Something is stuck on the hole where the pin should reside. Can use.,0
5,I like them,1
5,Very elegant very pretty that‚Äôs what I was told at the luncheon the ladies loved it I like the two that was my first time morning and I may go back and get another one another color,1
5,Good construction and function,1
5,Perfect slight for the Trumpers to wear while<br />I‚Äôm at work üòÇ,1
5,This watch is beautiful and exactly what I wanted. Not a huge face and looks just fancy enough,1
1,"Horrible Stitching,very thin",0
2,The pants ripped in the groin area the first day. The stitching is poor and the groin area is really far down from the waist causing it to have lots of stress when walking.,0
3,Very cheaply made. Sorry I didn't return it,0
3,To small!!,0
1,These are not 100% cotton as stated. I gave them away. Very disappointed.,0
5,This mask is great for kids who love fortnite! It holds up well as long as the kids don't lose the little rubber pieces on the sides that tighten the mask. I suggest hand washing these masks or take off the rubber pieces and replace them after the mask is dry. They can be machine washed...I have done it accidentally and they hold up well.,1
5,Fit perfect,1
4,I love these shirts they are perfect for working out I have several of these but this last package I purchased smells like B.O. right out of the packaging.,1
5,"I love these!!!<br />I come home and it‚Äôs the first thing I put on, I wear it till it time to take a bath.<br />Then I put on a shirt nightly.<br />But this is so comfy!!! Looks amazing on, I have wore a necklace and Sandles and cute flip flops.<br />And it‚Äôs so cute!??  Plus pocket for cell phone!!! Love it",1
1,"This dress is very short, can't bend in it.  The Olive colour is beautiful though",0
3,I like the style it's just a little too snug.,0
4,The print on this mask is really cute and the lining on the inside of the mask is smooth and comfortable to wear for long hours. The only downside is that the filter pocket in the lining is really large and tries to jump in my mouth when I talk.,1
1,I can't believe people actually have nerve to sell things ike this. These are nothing but cut-off piece of thin thin and thin piece of polyester legging: it is not even hemmed and it will unravel. Absolutely a joke! I returned them.,0
5,Buy your normal size for a nice thick coverage. If you size down they will get shiny. Still pass the squat test either way. Nice high waist and slimming fit. I love them!!!,1
3,super cute but the piece that holds the remaining band in place so it doesn't stick out while wearing it fell off and was lost right out of the package. I still wear it because it's so cute.,0
2,Run small orders up 2 sizes,0
2,Had to return as the face numbers were very hard to see.,0
5,Love it. Itis so cute and the dog looks just like my dog.,1
1,Design wasn‚Äôt flattering. Maybe should have sized up but not worth the exchange process.,0
1,It was very difficult to use. I ended up throwing it away. It wouldn't come off the sticky sheet it was attached to.,0
2,"the backpack image is good but there is only 1 pouch on the whole bag and no storage anywhere, if I would have seen that I would have purchased something better for school",0
5,Very good,1
3,Kinda thin more of a spring or autumn outfit,0
5,"Nice form fitting, I like how it is not too long either",1
5,I like these tags especially the steel cable connector.  It seems these tags will last a long time.,1
3,"Didn‚Äôt really fit. It was super boxy, too big, buttons looked cheap, and super thin material that made noises when you moved. If you want it I would definitely size down.",0
2,The fabric began pilling after second wear. Fit is good love the pockets but these won't last very long,0
5,Twist-O-Flex watch band continues to rate high after providing decades of comfortable and sturdy quality. In my book Speidel's products will always be a masterpiece.,1
1,It would have been a really nice thing to know that this sports bra runs at least a couple sizes too small. I wouldn't have had to waste my time on it.,0
4,"I like it a lot, wearing each of them. So far, as a person with sensitive skin, I have had no problems. Beautiful condition too.",1
1,Every bra broke or fell apart.,0
3,"I find the fabric very uncomfortable and in need of constant ironing. It is also not the best fit for me,",0
3,I like the material and it‚Äôs nicely made but it‚Äôs too big I should have went by the size chart and did a 2x but I listened to the reviews that it runs small and went with 3x and it‚Äôs too big in the top,0
5,"GREAT FIT THE FIRST TIME, A LITTLE TIGHT AFTER THE FIRST WASH",1
3,Good socks.  These socks feel good after wearing them.  The only issue I have is that they are a little big for me.  It you be nice if they came in different sizes.,0
3,"Nice socks, but not three pairs as indicated in the description of the item. Simply be aware you are paying for one pair",0
1,Don't like to heavy on face,0
5,I needed a little something to dress up an outfit and this butterfly pin did the job nicely. It seems to be well made and a good value.,1
5,"This is a very formal bag. The background is a goldtone metallic fabric. I was going to use it as an everyday bag, but it may be to dressy for that use. However, since I am 70 I can afford to be eccentric and may use it everyday after all. Also purchased the matching wallet. This is also a great price for this bag.",1
3,I would gave liked the bands to be fixed to the lights,0
1,I didn‚Äôt care for it. Kind of frumpy looking on me. Material is a weird polyester feel. Planning to return.,0
2,Received mine but it was tore,0
3,Love the fit of these pants but they are poor material quality. I have only worn them twice and both times was for just a few hours and they have already developed nits and pulls in the fabric. Not sure how long these will last. Disappointed.,0
5,"I love this hoodie on my son SO MUCH! My son is huge- he‚Äôs 18mo, 3‚Äô3‚Äù and 41lbs- so the size of a 4 year old! I got him the 4/5t and it fit perfectly with some room to grow. I love the compliments we get from people when we‚Äôre out and about. Hoodie is light but keeps my little one warm without making him hot. Letters have held up well with several washes and I wash all of his things on sanitize because...he‚Äôs a little dirty baby haha. Love this and will be buying another for his 3mo baby brother soon!",1
5,Perfect,1
1,Opened and the watch didn't turn on.,0
3,"I wore one of them once and the chain just broke the first time. and the other one broke after a couple of times, while I was putting it on.",0
2,CHEAP!!! Fell apart the very same day shipped,0
1,"As other reviews have stated, DO NOT buy these if you are taller than 5'. These fit my 12 year old daughter tight so expecting them to fit me at 6' 2&#34; is ridiculous. Holding them up, they would barely cover my knees. This has been nothing more than an exercise in futility and a waste of my time...",0
1,Poorly made,0
2,I got a 2x after reading the fit guidelines and I'd say the 2x fits a 10-12,0
5,"Me encanta la joyer√≠a de Santuza, es muy fina compr√© el anillo y los aritos, bellos. Los recomiendo",1
4,Looks nice but not really so rich as I excpected,1
5,Love the shirt! Soft comfortable and a forever Message!,1
5,"I have many bracelets from AMORWING and each one I love but...for some reason, this tourmaline/red tiger eye bracelet is my favorite!  I have really connected to this one.  It is beautiful and comfortable and powerful.",1
2,"Very casual. Edge seams are not straight, zipper doesn‚Äôt lie flat. Small is a little snug, length good.",0
1,It didn't work I looks like its suppose to be charged but a charger didn't come included. So I'm not sure there's no instructions on how to make it work either  .so I'm very dissatisfied.,0
1,The wires push out and show through the shirt.  Bad purchase,0
3,the bag itself is designed great just not built great. had it for about 3 months and the seam of the zipper for the shoe compartment started tearing. it is a cheap bag so i guess you get what you pay for. definitely good if ur carrying only some shoes and a change of clothes but far from a heavy duty bag.,0
1,I wore a white top with this necklace and the color wore off on the collar.,0
3,"This is a beautiful and flattering full coverage hat. I love the colors and floral print. It has a couple of issues. The drawstring clasps on the hat itself are only on one side, since the hat is big on me I cannot wear the hat with the floral side up because there are no clasps to attach the drawstring :( I have not worn to beach yet, so Im unsure how it will fare on a windy day. But the flap itself has some sort of wire in it that allows you to shape and bend as you wish. A great feature. I have a smaller head so it's big but very wearable and stays in place with the drawstring.",0
3,somewhat small in the breast area!,0
4,seemed kinda short to me but I love it!!,1
1,"I order two pair of 2xl I wear a size 12, these were so small !<br />My 9 year old daughter fit them and she is very thin .<br />These are not even a medium in adult size .",0
5,Muy bueno,1
5,"Nice,heavy duty.Two layers of leather glued and heavy stitched together while not being stiff on the wrist.No padding but it is meant to be rustic not sophisticated.Comes with pins.I like the bold, outdorsy stile of this strap and the distinct smell of leather.Fits well my wrist which is small to medium but it is not long enough for large wrists.",1
2,Pretty and flowing,0
3,Not all were good but nothing that could be done. Had losses on this shipment,0
5,Great quality beautiful bracelet.,1
1,The clasps does not open???? Have to take to the mall to have them put new clasp. NOT SATISFIED!!!!,0
1,I bought this watch for my daughter's 5th birthday which was this past Saturday and open the watch and it wouldn't turn on. I went to see if I could return but I had already passed the return window.,0
5,"My son loves blippi so of course he needs everything blippi, even the socks. They fit as expected and he is happy.",1
5,Looks so much nicer in person! It was exactly what I needed/wanted. Love it.,1
1,"The knot was too loose and the bracelet came open and I lost it already.  Beads are not PANDORA, they are cheap plastic.  Not a happy camper.",0
2,I wasn‚Äôt fond of the color of the shirt that arrived. But otherwise the shirt was a cute style.,0
2,The sides that rest on my ears were sharp and started to rub my ears raw. Feels like it needs to be sanded down to a smooth surface. I had to buy a new pair from Walmart.,0
5,"These gloves are very stylish and they fit perfectly.  I love them, I'll probably get them in another color.",1
3,cool,0
2,Too thick,0
1,"Not actual leather, despite description",0
5,Luvd them alot..The Quality and the Color and how there stand up..‚ù§Ô∏è,1
1,Short.,0
5,"If you are a man of elegance and shun mediocre stuff, these are the boxers to go for.",1
2,It looks like my 3 yr old painted it. It‚Äôs thick plastic. It doesn‚Äôt have any quality to it.,0
3,"Not Yellow. I ordered yellow and when it came it was more orange. Also, the size was a little small. So order larger than you need and if you want yellow, don't choose this.",0
3,"3 stars because I'm not satisfied with the size of the flower. It's smaller than the picture showed on baby's head. :-( nevertheless, it is gorgeous on my baby.",0
5,"Lights up great, very scary.",1
3,"I bought this in my usual size, the straps actually line up with my bra straps which is awesome, that doesnt often happen and I dont have much of an issue with the front opening especially after tightening the straps, it goes to my knees but after 2 half days of use and i havent washed it yet theres already piling in the inside which is going to be abrasive after time. I probably wont buy again, I shouldn't have to use a fabric shaver on a brand new product",0
5,Used this dress as my wedding dress & everyone loved it. Easy to wear & comfortable,1
5,I received these a few minutes ago & ripped open the package. Not the most fashionable shoes but then again neither are Crocs. I never thought I'd be so impressed with how comfortable they are. I own Cushionaire slides too but these beat out them by a million miles,1
1,"Small, waste of money",0
3,Quality of material not as good as I expected. Shrinks a lot once dried in dryer.,0
4,Love this shirt.,1
5,Does exactly what I needed them to do. Helps my daughters glasses stay on her face properly without sliding down her nose. We have had these about 3 months now and have not needed to switch out to a new pair.,1
5,"If a light weight, comfy, slouchy beanie is what you're looking for look no further. This hat is perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Super light weight and breathable. The perfect summer time beanie. If you've been hesitant on buying one go ahead and do it. You won't be disappointed.",1
3,Material too thin and didn‚Äôt was well.,0
3,"The print has nothing to do with the picture , or color.",0
4,"This is a very well-made product. The knit is tight, it's warm, and very soft. I like the graphic, and get curioous questions about it. I would note that it runs a little small; I am 6'1, 185, and I usually am comfortable in an L (as this one is), but it seems a bit tight. I think I'll keep this one out of the dryer.",1
3,"The colors on the straps, different shades of blue, green and purple are really very pretty.  But the footbed is hard and there isn‚Äôt enough arch support for me.  Customer service is great if you have a problem.  I am keeping them and wearing them for shorter periods of time because returning things to UPS is difficult for me.",0
2,The sweatshirt took an extremely long time to arrive and when it did it had a funny odor. The sweatshirt is not very soft and does not have much stretch to it. Would not buy again,0
3,"it‚Äôs really short, more like a shirt. This dress is for people that are under 5‚Äô8",0
3,"Great fit. Comfortable. However, the soles squeak when you walk which is really annoying! Can't wear them<br />outside of the house.",0
5,My wife said that these work perfectly for her diamond earrings. She was afraid of loosing them but these did the trick.,1
3,"I bought this because I thought it would make my [[ASIN:B009KYJAJY Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200M Duro Analog Watch, Black]] look more like a Rolex Submariner, and this band is commonly bought with the watch. It's not exactly perfect though.<br /><br />First off, I had to bend the clips on the band that hold in the spring bar. If you don't bend the clips, there's no possible way you can get the ends of the spring bar to get into the holes that hold in the bars on the watch itself and hold in the band. I got one end pretty good, but the other end is a bit loose, so I'll need to do a bit more tinkering to get a tighter fit.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm not sure if my product is defective or what, but the clasp doesn't 100% snap shut when it's closed. It wiggles a bit, which kind of annoys me. I have a Seiko watch with a metal band and a similar locking mechanism, and when it's snapped shut, it doesn't wiggle up and down at all. It's not too noticeable, but just noticeable enough to get on my nerves.<br /><br />Third off, a few days after I put the band on, I noticed there were some strange scuff marks on the clasp. They were't really scratches, but scuffs that I can't get off. At first glance they look like smudges, but when you try to rub them off, they don't rub off.<br /><br />Overall the band is alright and makes my watch look a bit like a Rolex Submariner. but I'll eventually start looking for another metal band to replace this one.",0
5,"I love these heels, look exactly like the picture.",1
3,Beautiful but it broke,0
2,"Not a thing  to do with a jeans or a jacket or denim at all!  It is simply a light blue shirt, cute,  but NOT what you are lead to believe it is.  Bummer!",0
1,Fell apart almost immediately after I got it. Not happy with this.,0
5,Love it.,1
5,A gift for my son he love it.,1
5,Absolutely beautiful! Lots of compliments.,1
5,great,1
2,Needs to be careful while selecting the size. My shoe size is 10.5 (US) and ordered 9-10 size of htis product expecting it to be a little tight. But it came out too big to a level that it easily comes off while walking.<br />The material seems to be good and comfy. I'm returning it and mostly going for a smaller size.,0
3,"Shirt is more like a football jersey material than it is tshirt type material. Much more clingy, shiny and tight than I expected from the reviews. I returned it for a refund. Looked like maybe it might have been cute for someone if you're looking for something shiny, clingy and like football jersey material.",0
4,awesome,1
1,Only got on fastener to pass through the needle.  Rest clog it.  Does not work.,0
5,Wore beautiful and washed beautifully!,1
3,"The quality is good and the color is beautiful, but it runs really small.  If you want it to fit like the picture, buy the largest size.",0
5,Photo does not do them justice. These earrings are so beautiful! I purchased the rose gold pair and fell in love as soon as I opened the package. Such a great deal!,1
5,"My granddaughter Loved these - vibrant, fun & just as described. I gave her wonderwoman accessories for her birthday, and these were a definite winner!",1
5,I use it for the gym great product,1
2,Fit was wierd on my body - not sure how. I gave it to my sister who is a little bigger and it looked great on her.,0
5,Super cute!!,1
1,"A tad bigger than expected. Tried to wash/dry thinking they would soften or shrink and neither happened. Hate to do it, but gotta go back to Feetures....<br /><br />Update: seller was wonderful to work with and refunded me due to unhappy purchase. Recommend you give this a try if looking for this type of item as the seller is communicative!",0
4,love the shine,1
5,My daughter loves it,1
5,Very good quality and my little girl loves it,1
5,"I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 150lbs and 34ddd boobs. I ordered a medium. Fit well. Gives you a flight attendant look but still cute.",1
5,"I was very pleased with the quality of my new chain, still where it daily with my cross on it and really like it! Got a good price and very satisfied! Thanks!",1
5,Very pretty.  Get lots of compliments,1
5,"I'm 5'1"" and 116 lbs. I puchased a small. It is perfect fit and can be worn with booties or boots.",1
3,The picture looks nicer than what I got. While it was still a decent product I expected more. It was very thin metal and it was larger than I was looking for. But for the price I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt complain too much,0
5,They're good keeps my shirt in place,1
4,"It's beautiful and supportive, but I wear a 36D so I ordered the 40D and even with the extender and on the largest clasp, I can barely breathe in it.  I do love it though so I am ordering another one.  I'm going with the 44D this time, I hope that will work out better.",1
2,"Massive gapping under the arms. A simple dart would not fix this. If taken in the lines on the cut are all wrong. The material is thin and the lining only comes halfway sudden your chest, so you can see the layers and it puckers over your chest.",0
3,It says it able to be shaped but it only shapes so much and I have very tiny toes and feet. It keeps turning on my toe so after 8-10 hours standing at work it starts to get a little irritating ... it does look exactly as pictured üôÇ,0
4,I purchased this for my brother. To my surprise it‚Äôs not cheap looking and every piece is functional. I was figuring about half these would actually be in perfect condition.,1
5,I got the pangshi camera wrist grip for my Nikon. It makes holding my camera so easy. I used to take the neck strap for my camera and wrap it around my wrist to hold my camera. Now with the wrist strap I don't have to use my neck strap. The Pangshi grip is easy to install. It does not come with instructions but it is pretty self explanatory. The Pangshi camera wrist grip is comfortable and easy to handle. The Pangshi camera wrist grip is adjustable. Overall a great and easy product to use. I would recommend it to my family and friends.,1
1,"Weird material, super tight, not what I expected.",0
1,Not my style but it can be hooked up.,0
1,"Not flattering and certainly not big enough. I am 5'5 and 142 lbs and usually wear a medium. I read reviews and ordered this in a large and it was STILL too tight. The bottoms were unflattering as they cut my butt literally in half. Half my butt was in the suit, half was bulging out under the seam. It looks awful. Overall the shape and style is cute in theory but the execution is horrendous.",0
5,Order a size up large fits a little tight I‚Äôm 5 foot 9 and 179 the over cover fit very well,1
5,They are just what I needed and feel great!,1
5,"I bought two of them one was the unakite it is a little smaller then the rhodonite pendant. A little dissatisfying on the size but it is made well and has nice color so I can't be that mad about it. I might give one as a gift. They are nice. They had a paper with the meaning of the stones but no mention of the unakite meaning. Here it is the meaning on both:<br />Unakite is said to be a stone of vision, opening the third eye and useful for scrying. It is also believed to be a stone of balance, grounding the self while bringing emotions and spirituality together.<br />Among crystal healing practitioners, unakite is used to support convalescence from illness.<br />Rhodonite is a stone of compassion, an emotional balancer that clears away emotional wounds and scars from the past, and that nurtures love.  It stimulates, clears and activates the heart.  Rhodonite grounds energy, balances yin-yang, and aids in achieving one‚Äôs highest potential.  It heals emotional shock and panic.",1
3,"This cap is satin lined and I really like the feel of it‚Äôs. It protects my natural hair well, but the head band elastic became loose after a few wears and now it slides back a bit during the night when I wear it.",0
1,Not what expected.  Misshapen so I returned.,0
3,"I really like this watch bracelet.  However, it broke within a month.  One of the straps came loose from where it was attached.",0
3,"I loved the suit. My issue is bottoms were too small. The suit is absolutely adorable. The material is definitely somewhat cheap. I don't think it will last long, as there already are seams that are pulling apart.",0
5,"Awesome shirt, design and fits great! Incredible price perfect for spring training!",1
3,Garter and stockings only. G string not included. Misleading.,0
5,Great quality and much bigger than I thought!,1
1,Low quality strange fit,0
5,Very nice! Comfortable and fashionable !,1
4,"This item is perfect in size and cost. The material breaths and keeps the compression around my thighs comfortable. Not to tight, exactly what I wanted.",1
2,"The band is uncomfortable and very cheaply made. Yes, more cheaply made that I expect given its cheap price. It is already peeling up on the edges.",0
5,"I love this skirt.  The material is great (not cheap or flimsy).  The colors are vibrant.  It appears well made.  It fit me perfectly.  Skirt length seems perfect (I'm 5'10"").  I'm paring it with a black keyhole shirt for a bachelorette party.",1
1,Way to big,0
5,Super soft and comfy.  Love them,1
2,Too have,0
5,Good length,1
2,Arrived with a hole in the shoulder seam,0
1,Made for small women with small everything. It has no support.,0
5,Comoda y buen material,1
4,Seems really short.  Shorter than the photo.,1
5,"Decided late to get a tee shirt for a race.  It came in plenty of time and was a good quality.  Fit was fine,",1
5,Horse show,1
1,Does not work with Timex Expedition; cannot attach to watch body. I think this is for a smart watch.,0
5,Very comfortable and I can wear my glasses underneath :-),1
3,"a little smaller than expected, and haven't used them much yet",0
5,Love the bright colors! This was perfect for my project.,1
5,I love this dress. So comfortable. Thin material but that's ok for the summer in Texas.,1
2,"Loved the look of this! My boyfriend was looking for a new watch and we both loved this one. I was delighted when I opened up the box and it was packaged nicely. The actual box the watch came in was protected by packing materials. As well as it had a peel off on the face to protect from scratches. Sadly my boyfriend only got to wear it for 10 minutes before it broke, while he was driving. The clasp fell off and came undone from his wrist. Just wish this product held up",0
2,Too small,0
1,This product is slightly defective. I guess it takes ‚Äúspecial gift‚Äù to  new level,0
1,Was delivered a pandora link instead of the bag so as far as I am concerned bad item.,0
5,My son Loves the hoodie but wish I would‚Äôve bought him a size or 2 smaller. He‚Äôs in between a XL & XXL so I went with the larger size. It fits very baggy and loosely on him. He‚Äôs hoping after a few washes it‚Äôll shrink a little bit lol,1
5,"This bracelet looks awesome. It was a very versatile accessory. My only complaint at first was that it wouldn't stay pulled to its smallest size for very long (I have tiny wrists) so I had to keep pulling it tight.  Ok, I could deal with that. However, after two weeks, it started to fall apart. One of the leather braids broke, and another leather wrap piece simply came undone. One of the silver/hematite bead combos came apart as well. I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/28/13- Beautiful Silver Jewelry did everything they could to make it right, including sending an identical replacement bracelet at no charge, which was a very nice surprise. The new bracelet is perfect- every issue I had with the first one is no longer a problem. I wanted to put it through its paces before updating my review. I've worn it almost daily for over a month. It stays tight around my wrist and there are no signs of wear & tear. Thank you Beautiful Silver Jewelry!",1
1,"Silver does not hold up, not good!",0
2,The sock came w a hole. Please send me a new set.,0
5,"Perfect if u want a sexy and classy look! I'm petite and it's hard for me to find dresses that fit right, but this is perfect!",1
5,"Love,love,love...wear to bed instead of silk pillow case, as a neck scarf, & headband, under my mountain bike helmet on cold days over my ears...get compliments all the time...great assortment of colors",1
5,This bracelet is beautiful. I am very glad that I ordered it.,1
1,"Material of shoe was as ghetto as possible!! Everything sticks to these shoes especially wood chips from the playground!! The wiser part is that the tongue is held on by 2 stitches on each side, do it flips inside out every time I open it up to put my sons foot in and to flip it in after his foot is in is impossible!! Cannot rats this shoe lower than one star unfortunately!! No padding either it's just like a few colors of 23¬¢ felt glued together & called a shoe!",0
5,Looks awesome and very stylish!!!  Fits great too!!,1
5,Very comfy!,1
5,Love this dress!! Fits as expected and looks amazing.,1
5,"I bought this for my uncle who is Desert Storm vet. He had an old Desert Storm hat that he wore everyday and everywhere, but it eventually just wore out. He had been searching for another one, but couldn't find one. He's not terribly computer savvy and doesn't use Amazon too much, but I popped on here real quick and found a replacement hat for him right away. He was very pleased when the hat arrived in the mail. God bless our troops!",1
3,Fits well,0
5,"El abrigo es muy bonito igual al ilustrado ,se siente calientito. Respecto al tama√±o lo ped√≠  XL ya que soy talla L y me qued√≥ un poco ajustado en el √°rea del busto.Esperemos que me funcione.",1
3,"These are bigger than I thought they would be, but then again I have small ears. Cute for short-term, but I wouldn't leave these in for longer than a day. I have sensitive & oily skin, and my ears are already turning from these earrings. I wore these out yesterday to a family thing in the park, and it's summer so it's hot and I'm sweating. I'm keeping them, because they're super cute, but know they'll probably turn your ear a little green behind the earring. Also these don't stay put very well--I keep having to rotate them back to where I originally positioned them. Probably one of those disk-backs would help.",0
3,Cute suit but not for a big chested woman.,0
2,This robe is very thin (see thru). I returned it.,0
2,The material itself is ok. Stitching is weak. Color is nice. Way too small and short. Does not fall where it appears to in the pictures. Disappointed to say the least.,0
5,Love that‚Äôs it‚Äôs thin but not clear/see through :) fit as expected. Would buy again.,1
3,"Love the necklace shape however, not so crazy over the color I picked. The mint green looks very cloudy in the jewels, not a fan",0
2,This was so disappointing. It looks faded and dingy and I‚Äôd never even been worn.,0
3,"No es cuero genuino , lamentable por eso.",0
3,"This necklace is adorable, but the arrow is so incredibly tiny that it's almost not visible unless you put your eyeballs inches from my neck. And if you do that, I'm going to be unhappy with your invasion of my space, so I don't recommend it. Well crafted piece of jewelry, though. Just extremely subtle.",0
5,Super cute. My daughter loves her charms and charm necklace. Good quality for a child's piece of jewelry.,1
5,"I was genuinely surprised how nice this watch looked.  The band is small, which came in prefect to fit my MIL.  She is tiny and this watch works great for her in being able to put it on or take off.  Hit all marks.",1
5,Espectacular reloj! S√∫per recomendable,1
1,I have purchased 3 housedresses in the past year (slow learner) and each one has either come apart at the zipper or a snap has fallen off.  Over $80 wasted!,0
1,"I took a chance and purchased these despite the bad reviews and it was a huge mistake. These reeked of gasoline. I couldn‚Äôt even keep them inside the house, let alone put them on my child. I‚Äôve purchased other items from this brand in the past and never had an issue so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on. Amazon should not be selling these.",0
5,Loved them they were just the right size for me,1
1,Doesn't slump off the shoulder as photographed.. fits like a sweater.,0
3,I just received the order. Tried them on and it fits great. The true test is wearing them around...,0
3,"Seems like a good shirt, but returned it because I found others I liked better.",0
3,These are really cute glasses but since my son has to wear them each and every day the inside would wear down his nose to the point where he bled....for occasional use good,0
2,The straws do not work! We even tried to cut them to where he could suck out of them and they were crimped. He still wore the hat with empty beer cans for looks,0
5,"Really, really nice leather wallet is very functional and attractive.  Seems like it will hold up for many years",1
5,"Very beautiful  earrings, just what I wanted; however the lever backs are not well made and I will have to get them fixed.",1
3,"Beautiful but cross is very sharp, cannot be worn against skin",0
3,"Comfortable but not durable, bought direct w/RX and love them for biking.  Problem I had is lenses are removable and tab that locks them in place broke. Ordered new lens holders and replaced lens (use hot water).  But new lens holder tabs broke again after short time.  Not sure why they break because I don‚Äôt change lenses ever?  Super glued now.....yeah $500 ish w/ RX and I‚Äôve super glued them and seem to be holding up.  Hope to get a few more years out of them.  These are large so be aware if you have narrow face they will look funky.  Perfect under bike helmet fit.",0
2,Stone fell out after a few minutes of wear.  Seemed to be glued in and poorly so.  Returned.,0
2,"Full disclosure, I had very low expectations to begin with. Somehow they weren't low enough. The watch came before the expected date but was smaller than advertised with a much smaller than expected band. The looks are great, the fit is terrible.",0
1,"It's not a tight fit.....falls off easily,  not well made",0
2,I'm not sure if it said on the listing that it is adjustable or not but the picture shows that it is not. I was disapionted when I opened the package. If I hadn't ordered it for my 12 year old I would have been upset. Not sure if I will order from them again.,0
5,good quality,1
5,"Awesome glasses, especially for the price! Shipping was quick even with the holiday weekend. They‚Äôre comfortable and love that tools are included.",1
3,They are cute but are not durable. The attachment falls off so does the beading.,0
4,"This set is adorable and it was comfortable for my little guy to wear for our whole event (where he got LOTS of compliments) Couple things... the shorts were a bit small. I have a tall 2 year old who is fairly thin. I ordered the 3t/4t size so the shorts would be long enough. The shorts definitely fit like a 2t around the waist. Also, the green coloring on the shorts rubbed off all over his diaper and parts of his thighs. It came off easily with a baby wipe, but was quite a bit of color runoff. I have a feeling these shorts will need to be washed separately a few times before being able to be put in with other clothes to wash. In hindsight I should have washed them before he wore them.<br /><br />Overall, good value and I will likely order other sets for events- I'll just size up! :)",1
5,Was perfect for my daughters school ID and phone,1
5,Was pleasantly surprised by the boot. It fits good and the color is just as shown. Would buy again. It goes with anything you‚Äôre wearing. Good price as well,1
5,He loved shirt. Very impressed.,1
3,"Very nice, somewhat small as I wear a size 9.5 and ordered a 9-10 and these run small. Not for going out as they look like slippers. I wanted  a slipper shoe.",0
5,"I returned the first dress cuz I'm usually a size 14/16, but it won't zip up at the back, so I ordered 1 size up. It seems still tight but I love it so much g btgat I'm gonna make it work.",1
3,"Cute design, but wtf is up with these awkward buttons? When you snap them in between the buttons is open and you can see what you are wearing underneath. Did anybody even check this product out before they sold it? Go back to the drawing board.",0
5,"At first I was a skeptic but now I'm a believer of this dress. I'm about 200Ibs and 5'3 ordered a large. The fitting and length was just right. Get it, people!üòÅ",1
3,"I ordered a size small because I am 5'2 and 120 pounds, however, this product felt very restrictive when I put it on. There are three hooks within the coat that are used instead of a zipper to keep the coat together. This coat would have been more comfortable if it was the correct size. I am having a difficult time moving my arms around as I wear it. There's no hood for this coat, but it does have a fur collar. The faux fur is soft and comfortable to touch.<br /><br />I have included an image within this review for a better visual of what this product looks like. The hooks are a bit difficult to keep together, but the belt that comes with the coat may be able to assist with this.",0
2,The only reason this shirt got two stars is because it was cute when we took it out of the package and our daughter got to wear it for her birthday party. I'm very disappointed that after only two washes all of the rainbow colors were gone and we were left with this drab design. She will not get to wear it again.,0
5,I got these for my granddaughter (toddler) and they fit just fine in her Crocs. She loves them. It comes with a band that can be used as a bracelet.,1
5,This hat was what I expected it to be. Looks great. I honestly bought it to remind me of a dear friend who passed away  (who I never meet ) . Thank You Mr./Mrs. Seller.,1
3,Was not the color in the picture.,0
5,"Love it!  Very nice, light and cool and comfy.",1
1,Scratchy material and fit much tighter then I expected.,0
5,The band does not leave nasty mark on ankle or calf. Nice thickness for wearing with a casual shoe. Si far washing them is OK. No fuzz sticking to them.,1
3,Maybe I could lose a pound or two. but I like the merchandise,0
5,Looks just like the picture. The fabric is soft. The tank is just the right length.,1
5,"Completely compliant with unscientific requirement for face coverings, and just as effective as the goofy paper masks, Gators, and cloth masks. They are lovely and durable.",1
1,This pic makes it look sexy and let me tell you it's anything but. The feel of the material is rough and scratchy. It even has shoulder pads . . .I haven't seen shoulder pads since the 90's. The shirt was huge and not cute at all in person. I returned.,0
3,"This dress didn't fit me well at all, made me look pregnant, but the reason I'm returning is because the color is off in the photos. It's much darker in real life, which unfortunately will not work for family pictures I had planned to wear it in.",0
2,Cute but WAY smaller than I thought it would be.,0
5,I bought this as a &#34;goal&#34; outfit. Something cute to wear when I get to my goal weight. I'm 5'1 and about 160 lbs. I got the large and it fits good. Not see through. It's not too long and I have to hold it up just a tad with flats on but that's not a big deal. That's what heals are for. Can't wait to see how I look in it when I weigh 140!,1
5,Grandson noticed it in the toy box and pulled it out first! He enjoys playing with it,1
3,In the picture it showed a lighter color. When I received the dress it was a darker pink. I also ordered another dress in the same color. It was a much lighter pink like what was in this picture. I had the dress altered at the order so I couldn‚Äôt return it. They did disclose that to me about not returning if I made alterations at the time of order. The alterations were fine. The color of the dress wasn‚Äôt like in the picture. Before you have alterations done online make sure the color and style is what you want.,0
5,I'm about 5' 2'' and 130 pounds or so. Ordered the medium. It looked like it was going to be too big but then put it on and it fit perfectly. It wasn't super tight which was great. If you wanted... you probably could fit in a small if you wanted it to show more of your figure.,1
5,Fits great not hot.,1
5,Very comfortable and absorbent too.  Highly recommend these!,1
5,Lite weak,1
5,It has a soft inside and my hp fits perfect in it. Even enough space to hold folders and papers. Front pockets for the chargers n any other additional accessories.  Soft handle to go over shoulder . Recommended.,1
1,Spikes blood sugar!  False advertising! And they won‚Äôt return!,0
1,Very disappointing to me as well as to my 5 year old daughter. So excited to try on her new bathing suit that doesn‚Äôt fit.  I ordered size 5 and received a size 2.,0
3,Its very pretty bling but too big for my face,0
4,Fits a little smaller than expected but overall good buy,1
5,Made my dad shine for the holiday,1
5,This was a gift,1
5,"Comfy , cozy slippers .",1
2,"Good product but wrong item. I ordered the black tie and received a red tie. Yes, I understand I can return the product but did not feel like driving to ups.",0
5,It fit nic,1
5,Great through this year's snowy winter. Keep my hands warm and dry.,1
5,Great straw style purse at a very reasonable price.,1
3,"My daughter really likes these sandals, but for some reason they keep sending us the wrong size. She‚Äôs currently wears an 8 with a little room to grow. I ordered a size 8 toddler. The first pair was 24 months so I exchanged. The second pair was also labeled 24 months but were bigger than the previous. Still too small though so I returned them and now ordered a 9.5 toddler. Fingers crossed a sandal that actually fits her shows up. Overall the quality seems decent for a sandal.",0
1,"While it did fit, the material was not nice and it was a lot of fabric for a skirt. Also, it is not mini. I am 5'4 and it was right at the middle of my knees.",0
3,It's ok wish it fit more,0
5,Received earlier than expected.  Perfect coloring and size.  Will be well loved by the new owner.,1
3,"Lots of reflection, not as clear as I‚Äôd like.",0
3,Size to big should be like original size kd's,0
5,Perfectly highlights my two little girls!,1
1,Too small not exactly what we wanted it to be,0
2,it looks really cheap looking,0
5,Great quality at a great price. I got this way before time!!!,1
5,Good quality slippers,1
3,Good quality solid stainless steel material but only fair workmanship because the edges of the links are sharp and should have been beveled to assure a smooth touch against the skin. Other than that the price is unbeatable.,0
5,Absolutely beautiful bracelet! The customer service is fantastic and the quality of the jewelry is amazing. Will most definitely be purchasing from this seller again!!,1
5,"FEELS GREAT AND LOOKS CUTE ! FAST SHIPPING. I HAVE MANY OF THESE IN DIFFERENT COLORS, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALL COLORS. MAYBE ONE DAY. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM AGAIN. THANK YOU :)",1
1,"I received these on time.  One owl had flat black eyes and was more brown in color.  The other earring had raised/rounded eyes and didn't match at all (the second earring was more copper in color).  Both earrings looked nice, but absolutely didn't match at all.  I was very disappointed.  They were promptly sent back.  :(",0
2,"I am disappointed too small, in the picture it was loose fitting.",0
5,"Received today and I‚Äôm love it. Great quality, color, and style. I highly recommended.",1
5,My hairdresser loved it!,1
1,Product does not stay secure.,0
5,"I love this crossbody bag, so cute!",1
2,"Too tight and difficult to put on. While they do 'poof' up they don't seem to be much warmer when poofed than when not. The bottoms are terrible and not only slippy but will shortly wear out if you do any trips to the kitchen for snacks or to the restroom. Cloth socks are warmer...and cheaper than these. Toes are the coldest with these...almost no appreciable 'warmth' felt. I did try these as socks inside slightly larger booty style slippers, and that set up was very warm...but alone these aren't that good. They could be good worn to bed...but for my purpose (worn watching TV after shower and pj's are on) they're not that good. for 29-30 they're not terribly expensive...except that they don't work.",0
3,The fit is just kind of strange.. it was still too big/loose on top for me.  If you don't have much on top this might work okay.,0
5,So comfortable,1
5,Excellent!!!!,1
4,Light weight perfect fit order size up,1
1,No water proof  water go ensite,0
1,It broke as soon as I took it out of the box. It completely fell apart.,0
4,"Buen material, solo que es muy larga, tendr√© que ajustarla, pero en general buen material",1
1,fit was to short,0
1,It looks like kindergarten arts and crafts,0
5,We love the office and Dwight happens to me my son's favorite character! The hat was GREAT quality and a GREAT buy I would highly RECOMMEND,1
3,"This is a nice cap, unfortunately the shipping was not the appropriate, it was shipped in a plastic bag instead of a box that helps  the cap keep its original shape during the shipping.",0
1,Cheaply made,0
5,Ordered these for my son.<br />He‚Äôs very pleased with them<br />Exactly what he wanted,1
5,Super flattering fit. A lot nicer than what I expected.,1
3,If you have a shapely figure they were not cut for you...,0
5,Look sterling.... I love them. Such a good buy.,1
2,weird cut.,0
5,"I absolutely love this little jacket. So much so that I‚Äôm in the process of ordering 2 more in different colors. It fits great, it‚Äôs comfortable and the pockets are a plus.  It‚Äôs well made too, very nice quality.",1
5,Great product...awesome presentation! Arrived with 2 days of purchase. My little brother is sure to love it.,1
1,Really tight,0
5,"Bought this for an xmas gift for my mother, She loved loved loved this watch. I would recommend to others's",1
3,just ok,0
5,"This watch is big and amazing, for the price din‚Äôt expect this kind of quality of watch, looks super cool and high quality, thanks for this great product.",1
5,Came sooner than expected. Great value for the price.,1
5,It arrived quickly and they are uber cute.,1
1,"I ordered the green plaid shirt, excepting to get the shirt in the photo. As you can see the one I got has the kahki brown as a base color. Not the most aestheticly pleasing thing I've ever seen.<br />As alot of other reviews say these shirts are too sizes to small. If your a size medium order a size XL.<br />I've had issues ordering from Romwe in the past and this is probably the last time I'm buying from them again.",0
1,"Though the jewelry is nice, it‚Äôs not practical. They didn‚Äôt have enough lip to stay put in my ears. Too heavy to be like that.",0
5,"Love the silky material, got a small and I typically wear a small.  It is a loose fit but I like the way it lays on me.  It is a longer shirt, I also love that.  I have black and a blue one love them both!",1
1,The quality of this dress was awful. The sash was uneven and the pleats at the halter were off. I was so completely disappointed with this dress. It is absolutely being returned!.,0
3,"Meh. It wasn't the soft feel I was looking for, more like a coat with a perm. The inside was jersey, not sherpa either. It was boxier than I'd hoped, but it's okay for WFH, I guess.",0
5,exactly what I wanted,1
1,It broke after three weeks,0
5,Muy practicas y elegantes,1
1,Runs rediculous small!! I purposely order a size bigger after reading all the reviews that the bathing suit runs small and the size up was still way too tiny! Now I have no choice but to return this. I saw it came from China so their sizing chart is probably way off for America's standards!  :/,0
5,"Added these on for free shipping. Well worth it for the price, sweet pair of sunglasses for work that I'm not worried about scratching. Even came with case and lens cloth.",1
2,"The vendor was great, shipped it out to us asap! We would use the vendor again... but the ring was not quite what we thought it was as it was alot lighter in weight than we expected so we returned it. But that was not the vendors fault.",0
3,nice earring but very hard to get close especially on the small ones,0
5,I can‚Äôt believe the value of this band. Super cute and comfy for when I don‚Äôt want to wear my athletic band. And the packaging was so cute too!,1
3,Too big for a bucket hat,0
5,Put these on a nicer pair of sneakers and they look really sharp. Keeps the shoes on and comfortable.,1
2,These headbands were pretty thin - I was looking for something to deflect sweat off my face during hot yoga and these just didn't do it,0
3,"Got an XXL and it is STILL too small... I'm a bigger dude - 5' 9&#34; and 230lbs and stocky. My biceps are about 14.5&#34; around while relaxing, and these sleeves squeeze.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great length, I needed something to cover from wrist to almost my armpit, these are the perfect length.<br />- These have a sort of rubberish black band (but it doesn't pinch like rubber would) in the bicep area that holds in place perfectly. This is great, but is also partially a con... it adds to the tightness of the bicep area.<br /><br />Cons<br />TOO TIGHT! The fabric itself is great, breaths and is comfortable and not tight, but the black band area is much too tight for being XXL. They DO stretch significantly, but the pressure of the band makes it uncomfortable to wear for longer than 30 minutes.<br />I have tried to pull and stretch the black band area to try and see if I can get it a bit looser, but no such luck.<br /><br />It does the trick, but it's not perfect.",0
4,LIKE the authenticity but the sizes run small.,1
5,I love this! Mine got really shiny shortly after wearing it. It  draws a lot of attention i get a lot of compliments on it.  This is a great piece to have if you are looking for a piece of jewerly to wear all the time.,1
2,I wanted these to work they are so cute but the first time trying to put them on the bar snapped and I can‚Äôt fix it so I<br />Guess I have one earring now and not two,0
5,As long as you use the size chart this shirt should fit exactly as expected. I get lots of compliments on this shirt.,1
1,Very small and uncomfortable,0
3,"I like the shirt, the cut is nice and fits well. What annoys me are listings giving inaccurate fabic descriptions. This is not chiffon or even close to chiffon. It's polyester with a pebble texture. It's worth about $5",0
2,Not bad.  A few wiggly parts but for the price not too bad.,0
5,This top is too cute! Comfy and colorful. I would recommend ordering a size down if you like your tops a little more form fitting but either way I love it.,1
5,Great hat! Looks cool. Holds its shape good. My 6 year old son wears it and says he looks very secret agent-y in it.,1
5,"Quality and fit were as expected for an affordable set. It runs a bit small so I would size up if you are in between sizes. A decent amount of stretch making it perfect for yoga, Pilates, and anything low intensity.",1
5,Excellent purchase!,1
3,"I was a bit disappointed it only came in the large size. I have to wear it on its tightest setting. I also have issues with the it staying connected to the watch, the top band disconnects if I bend my wrist, but if I reverse the bands it stays put.",0
5,Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES this belt! This is his first ratchet type belt and I don‚Äôt think he is ever going back. We will see how it holds up in the next few months but as of now he is very happy!,1
2,This Sandel was too big .,0
1,Not the right size at all two sizes smaller then what it really is,0
5,"This skirt is super cute.  It‚Äôs a true high waisted skirt and the elastic waistband in the back makes it comfortable.  It‚Äôs a little shorter than it appears in the photo - I‚Äôm not particularly tall (5‚Äô-2‚Äù) and it hits me about an inch below the knee, which is perfect because I was anticipating having to hem it.  The fabric is thick and hangs well, and it‚Äôs true to the size chart.  I‚Äôm a 30‚Äù waist and ordered the medium.  The only thing I‚Äôd change is adding pockets to it.",1
3,"This shirt is a lot cuter than I expected. I did find the material to be really stiff and wrinkles real easily, even after I washed it. The pattern on it is really nice and it fits really well. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",0
3,Just ok...not as shiny as I expected. I also think they sell &#34;seconds&#34; not quite perfect...stones not placed perfectly.  Was pricey and I expected better.  Also took forever...I have ordered things from out of the country...never took this long. Will prob not order again...,0
2,The color of the earrings are completely different from what's advertised. Not even close; it's more of an emerald green.,0
5,Very good quality.  Made of painted wood. Clean and simple design doesn't fight with my decor.  Love it!,1
1,"They look good, but they are very low quality metal. The posts bent as I put the hasp on.",0
3,"I'm 115lbs. 36c in chest. 5""2. Ordered a small but it was super big still.  I had to cut to make adjustments.",0
1,Product smelled like rubber.  Very strong smell.,0
2,"I was excited about this suit, but the material is thinner than I wanted, not as sturdy as most ""athletic"" suits. It also was wider than it was tall. I'm returning it as it barely covered my chest. I got a large size, since I usually wear size 10. It was wide enough, but it was built for someone more around 5 foot, not 5'6 or taller. I'm dissapointed and am returning mine. I read other positive reviews and was hopeful. :(",0
2,It was to small for me and I did not like have it look on me,0
5,"I am 64 and weigh 135 pounds with measurements of 40, 30, 35.5 and the medium fits great (even though the chart said my bust was too big for it).There is plenty of stretch in the top to accommodate me. You can wear it conservatively with a high v-neck or have a plunging v-neck depending on where you place the side of the dress. I liked it so much, I ordered a second one. It's very comfortable and is a good length, as shown.",1
5,"I bought one for a bridesmaid to see if I would purcahse the rest from here and I am. I recieved it before expected and the purple was nice and rich, not to thin either. The rhinestones on the back are cute but I am keeping it in the package until I have to give it to them to make sure they dont fall off. Overall for the price it was a great purchase.",1
2,This item is not the best quality. It fell apart after just a few days. The clock still works however my daughter can not wear it because the loop that is attached to the owl broke off.,0
3,"The belt seemed to be of good quality, but it was too small.  I could only use the first hole.  I wear a size 38 pants and all of my belts are size 40.  I purchased four Trafalgar belts; two fit fine and two were too small.  The inconsistent sizing is frustrating!",0
5,Best watch available anywhere for the money.,1
1,The product was too small and there was no return label.,0
3,"I was really hoping I would love this, but it was just a bit too big on me. I really wish they made their clothes in different sizes - I love their style/design, but I'm only 5'2&#34; so most things swallow me up. Sadly I had to return, but it was an easy process so I would give 5 stars for that.",0
2,They're so cute! I was excited to get them but low and behold the silver one got stuck in my nose. Had to use PLIERS to get it out..,0
4,Runs large,1
2,I loved it originally but just recently I have realized that the edges of the lock are extremely sharp and it can cut you. My husband has been wearing it for almost 3 months and last night the bracelet caught my hand and sliced it open. Not the seller's fault but you do need to be VERY careful with this bracelet,0
3,Too small,0
2,"I have thick thighs, not that much though... and they were so tight it looked like it was squeezing my thighs.",0
1,"First time I put them on, one of them broke. Very disappointed. I would give no stars but has to select one.",0
1,"I purchased these since the underwear had amazing reviews. I wanted these underwear so that I could wear them at home or when I'm on my period. Unfortunately, these are not flattering since the panty line is SO VISIBLE. Additionally, they began to rip from the crotch area after a couple of washes.",0
5,"It looked just like the photo! I love it so much, it‚Äôs so pretty!!!!",1
1,These were very small.,0
5,Love them!,1
3,Feel and thickness are great but I am constantly having to pull them up. There is not enough elastic in the waist so you constantly have to pull them up. I ordered a smaller size thinking that would solve the problem since I like them so much. I had the same issue with the medium. For great everywhere but waist kept sliding down as you move around.,0
2,Quality not as good as I expected,0
5,It's beautiful,1
1,"These swim trunks are horrible and I do not recommend them.  The material used feels like paper, very thin and very cheap paper.  The stitching is poorly done and the shorts appear too shoddy to last.<br /><br />Here‚Äôs more of the issue for me.  I purchased a pair of this particular design of swim trunks in 2018.  They were purchased on Amazon from another manufacturer than the ones here and are excellent quality swim shorts.  The price points were similar and the only reason I didn‚Äôt purchase those again is because they didn‚Äôt have my size in stock. Comparing the two identical designs, from the two different manufacturers, it is easy to see the difference in quality.<br /><br />There is also what appears to be product copying.  Traditionally, this is seen happening to our domestic products by foreign companies.  But, in this case, it‚Äôs one manufacturer copying another manufacturer‚Äôs product, within their own country.<br /><br />I hate leaving negative reviews but I feel a responsibility to inform people of my experience in various purchases I make.  I won‚Äôt name the good/correct manufacturer that I‚Äôve referenced here, only in the spirit of fairness to the manufacturer of these shorts.  However, a quick search on Amazon for ‚ÄúMen's Quick Dry Swim Trunks Bathing Suit Beach Shorts‚Äù, should hopefully lead you to a better place.<br /><br />I do not recommend these Lncropo swim trunks.  And I‚Äôm returning them to get my money back.  From this point forward, I will only purchase this type of swim trunk from the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù manufacturer that I‚Äôve referred to here in this review.",0
5,"Gorgeous toe ring!! Arrived in a cute little pouch, fits perfect and is very sturdy which is great. In love with the design and pink shell in the center. Definitely recommend this toe ring to anyone!!",1
5,I ordered these based on how they look alone. I feel like I stole them when they got here! They‚Äôre plastic lenses but full metal frames which is where all my plastic ones cost twice as much break. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be a bit disappointed when I inevitably drop them and scratch the paint on them but for $5 who can complain.,1
3,Really baggy and starts to fray really fast. I've had it for almost two months now.,0
3,"Lovely yellow. Adapatable to many outfits. But!! (1) the underskirt shows a bit, (2) is not as ‚ÄúA line‚Äù as the picture portaits",0
5,Best belt ever.,1
2,I pulled them up and RIP! I didnt expect much for $9.99 and Im glad i did not.,0
5,"Fits slightly too large but not by much, looks good and seems to be high quality. I'd say that it's well worth the price.",1
1,The Pants Were Cream And See through<br />The Fabric Was Cheap And The Holes Looked Like Some Cut Them At Home,0
5,Love it,1
5,Comfortable and true to color description.,1
2,Button fell off before I could even put it on.,0
5,"Son geniales, la calidad de la tela es muy buena, son muy frescas.",1
1,Broke not even an hour after my daughter put it on and it wasn't even tight.,0
5,Great fit,1
5,good quality just too big for me,1
5,Fit perfect. Very nice material,1
5,"It's a great bathing suit, but it does fit tight for the size. But next size up I think would have been too large.  I went by the reviews that were there and ordered the next size up, as recommended, and that fits only a very little tight, but OK.",1
2,"For $15.99 for a pack of 12 pairs I expected these to have the rubber grip on the heal part to keep from slipping. But these do not, within a few feet of walking these slipped right off the back of my foot. I put them back on and kept going and again, slipped right off. I haven't been wearing these for even 30mins and I'm switching them to cheap ones I bought at the shoe store that have the rubber grip. It's essential.",0
1,I really wanted to love these shoes but there is zero support from the straps and it‚Äôs impossible to walk in them. At least not like a normal person. üòè,0
1,"Do not buy it, the rubber that holds the strip to the glasses cracks, it does not last more than a month.",0
5,These socks were a gift for my daughter. We both love these socks!,1
2,Lovely product‚Ä¶if your 1 size is a size O‚Ä¶I am a 4/6‚Ä¶way too small‚Ä¶,0
1,Not the same as previous.  Waistband is not the comfort flex.  It will not survuve many washings before getting rolled and wadde up.,0
5,"This was so cute, used for an 8 year old and she loved it.",1
1,Snapped off the post after only wearing 3 times,0
1,Not as presented poorly made,0
3,They are not kidding when they say these are oversized! Decent quality and are exactly as advertised but I feel like Elton John when I wear them.,0
1,This is not for shorter women.,0
5,I‚Äôm usually a size small but I ordered these in a large because it was the only size left. Surprisingly the large fit perfect. The pjs are very cute and comfortable! You might have to size up depending on how curvy you are.,1
5,My daughter wanted this for Christmas. She loves it. Fits her good.,1
3,"These are not as warm as I'd hoped. Was chilly with pair long underwear under them on a windy day.  They are warm as long as wind is not blowing.  Don't like the Clasp closure for waist, button or snap would be better.<br />I'm 5'8"" 175 lb and bought women's XL.  A little tight in thighs, but fits comfortable at the hips and waist.<br />They are very stylish, luv the fleece lined pockets.  Overall can't go wrong at this price.",0
5,"I am in love with this dress for Fall!!  I purchased the green floral print dress in size Medium and it fits perfectly. I weigh 150 pounds and I'm 5'7&#34;, about a size 8.<br />I washed it one time without any problems, remember to dry it flat. I  also wore this dress once so far with boots, with and without leggings, and both ways worked well. The pockets are great! I used one side for my cellphone and you can't even tell it's in there.<br />The dress shipped out quickly and arrived in new condition. I'm considering buying another one in a different color. At this price it's a steal.",1
3,Not very will thought out on the pockets,0
5,Cute!,1
5,Me gusto !!,1
1,"This skirt has a waist that is the strangest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs like the elastic was tied in a knot on the left and the right hip before it was covered in fabric. That elastic continued to twist around in the waist for some extra crazies we had to fix before even trying it on.<br />It‚Äôs also making my hips appear wider- unattractive in my opinion.<br />Disappointed since it was so cute, soft and warm, and a fantastic color too‚Ä¶ Returning this one ‚òπÔ∏è",0
1,These socks where already opened when I got them and looked like one pair had been worn and washed. They are also really big.,0
3,"I like it, not as wide as it looks",0
1,"Ultra thin material..not at all what it appears to be in the photo..fit small..I bought for myself..was so disappointed with it I have away, with tags still attached..Did not even bother with returning...",0
5,Fits true to size!  great top!,1
2,Very hard to put on and harder to take off because the hole size is tighter than the standard earwire.,0
2,I love the color and the lace but I picked my exact size and it ended up feeling like a small when I bought a large,0
4,This necklace is beautiful very well-made very colorful matches almost every outfit,1
3,"The fit is comfortable, but the baby makes the front way too heavy. There is no support for the baby, so you still have to support the baby with your arm. This hoodie is not for long outings because your arm will be killing you by the time you finally get to set the baby down.",0
2,"I like the logo but it was very oddly shaped in my opinion. What I mean by that is it was very short and too wide. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm super tall, not sure. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying it",0
5,"Runs very large! The dumb tie doesn‚Äôt lay right and looks bulky.  I‚Äôve tried to tie it several different ways and ughhh!  Thick fabric, nice dress but if you have bigger boobs makes you look like a boxy tent. I should send it back",1
1,It was too big to me.. shoulder is too wide...<br />Look good by itself but seizing isn‚Äôt right,0
3,I love the look and idea of this sweater. The fit is nice. Unfortunately I have not worn it. I cannot get the creases out from the packing. Super disappointed!,0
5,"Wonderful, very cute little dress. Fits perfectly and my granddaughter looks absolutely adorable. Will be buying more.",1
2,SIZE VERY SMALL FOR LISTED SIZE,0
5,"Love this bag, it is better in person. sturdy and absolutely gorgeous looking! Would recommend this bag for office, luncheons and evenings, dress down with jeans, dress up with dresses. not too small and not too big. perfect for me.",1
3,Adorable shirt. It runs very small especially in the shoulders and chest area.,0
5,"These are well made, SUPER cute, and have long battery life. Recommend.",1
1,I only received one and paid for 2 !!,0
2,"I was expecting cold air.  I used water and also with a mix of ice, didn't make a difference.  This doesn't blow any colder than a regular fan.  I plan on returning it and just getting a desk top fan for half the price.",0
1,The glasses are considerably larger than they appear in the picture. They look quite ridiculous,0
4,I thought would fit my child but it was too big and almost covered her whole face.  But it would fit good on adult,1
1,Barely used and the boots and soles have failed. Holes on the soles of both boots. Used less than 20 times.,0
3,"My mom bought this for me, and when I got it I was so disappointed. It wasn't made very well for starters the lettering would definitely not hold up well threw the washer. But besides that it had a very odd/small fit to it. It seemed to be long enough but a little snug on the belly and super large on the chest area especially near the arms. For reference I am 5'2&#34;, 129 lbs, with a 34DD chest.",0
1,"This product does not resemble the advertisement at all, it is also much smaller than I expected. I am very disappointed with this item",0
4,Great!,1

1,poor low quality,0
5,Perfect for my Sera from dragon age cosplay!,1

5,"I ordered a 3 pack this time ,It was such a good price ,I couldn‚Äôt resist ,this makes it my 7th hat ,these hats are perfect hair coverings for a pandemic if u work at a hospital like I do ,They are also good for a bad hair day & cute enough to wear to make a statement . I will purchase more of these hats.",1
1,Thought charm would be smaller but it is big. All stones in it. Cute colors<br />UPDATE.<br />Broke on the 2nd day of wearing. Bummer.,0
1,I bought 2 size up n it still didn‚Äôt fit.,0
3,I bought these to replace the daith ring in have now that‚Äôs a loop. I couldn‚Äôt get them in all of the way. I think the post is a little too short.,0
5,AWSOME,1
1,"Fabrics as for a halloween costume, one cannot wear it to work.",0
2,I‚Äôm so disappointed. I paid for expedited shipping which was still super late but i took the chance. The dress is not remotely similar to the picture shown and it does not compliment my body at all. the sparkles make it look pink. Do not buy this especially if you‚Äôre on a crunch.,0
3,Would be great to add some traction on bottom,0

4,"My wife loves these socks.  Expensive, but it makes her happy.",1
3,Looks great but bar was too short so I couldn‚Äôt fit,0
2,Seemed a bit generic and cheap.  Didn't like the cut of the jean- long waisted and crotchy,0
5,I love abalone shell and this is such a pretty color. They're very light and simple. I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. A definite treat for yourself!,1
4,"The size of these earrings are perfect.  They are really nice, but they do not look at all lavender.  They actually look like the gem stone for the month of June called Alexandrite.  They are perfect to give as a gift as well.",1
3,"I ordered the size of undershirt I normally wear, and this ""slimming"" undershirt fits the same. I was expecting the fit to be more snug, but it is not.<br />I should've just ordered my regular shirts in a smaller size",0

1,One side of frame came crooked.,0
5,Just as described,1
1,Doesn't fit her feet at all. Hopefully she'll grow into it.,0
3,"These seem like really nice pants. The fabric is thick and quite stretchy. They didn't fit me, though. So you might consider ordering a size larger than you normally wear. Or maybe it's because they're compression pants that they're meant to be tight. *shrugs* I wish I could have tried them on first.",0
4,pretty but a bit heavy for my ears. Seems to be well made.,1
2,This dress is too short for me.,0
5,Like the color of the earrings and the style.,1
1,The earrings appear larger and more substantial in the advertisement. So tiny when you open the box. You would not want to give them as a gift. Totally disappointed! üò©,0
5,"Not super thick but not super thin either. They‚Äôre not your ‚Äúwarm‚Äù socks, just the regular ones you would wear under regular shoes. It was a gift so all I can tell is that the person liked it and said it was cute.",1

5,"This is a beautiful multifaceted necklace with loads of sparkle. It is just the right size and weight on the neck. I plan to wear it with cardigan sets and pleated A-line skirts this fall to create that classic, lady-like look that I love to see and emulate this time of year!!",1
5,"These bed socks are just perfect. They are lightweight, stretchy, soft and they keep my cold feet warm without binding or feeling heavy. They come out of the wash just as nice as new. and the purple is so pretty ! The  only thing that has worked this well is my Dachshund's warm tummy.",1
5,I bought this for my friend whose husband passed. Simply southern is true to size and colors. She loved it.,1
1,"BAIT & SWITCH! I ordered Sky Blue. & got a dirty dark blue with rips & distressed areas so bad that the sleeve will rip off from taking it on & off because it is too small (I ordered a larger size even)! Poor presentation! Item was used (it was supposed to be NEW!), filthy yellow spots, smells, etc. Bag was melted shut & coat smells of melted plastic bag! BAIT & SWITCH!",0
5,Awesome!,1
1,"I ordered 4XL sized,  didn't fit. They fit my nephew perfect that has 28 inch waist.  That's right my size 4XL was shop small it only would 15 year old boy with 28 inch waist perfect.  Not worth the money to return.",0
1,Won't hold too big,0
1,earrings i recieved were silver. not what is pictured. didnt care for them.,0
5,"Since I wear a mask most of the day for work, I needed help to keep my glasses from fogging up especially in the cold. I do have to apply the spray several times during the day, but it works!",1
5,Just as pictured. Came in time for trip to family reunion. Everyone loved it.,1
5,Bought these for my sister. She absolutely loves them! She says it only hurts her ears very slightly if worn for long periods of time. She wears a pair every day and is thrilled about how gorgeous they are! There's no beating that price and quality.,1
2,"They will serve the purpose of keeping things &#34;bundled&#34; together ie underwear, socks etc so the suitcase is more organized but they are very cheaply made and not high quality. I ordered two sets...one for me and one for a gift. I am considering returning the second set as I will be embarassed to give them as a gift. I also do not &#34;appreciate&#34; the silly stuff printed on the bags: Secret Pouch etc. Not too impressed.",0
3,"Looks nice but is a little too small to fit money in the zipper and the part that clips to the lanyard came off the hole, and this is pretty cheap and not quality.",0
3,"Awesome but design, the lettering you.. can ...but cant seee it super well. Wish it was more clear.",0
4,Just the right size love it üòä,1
3,Beautiful and high quality but way too big and I am on the larger side for a small and this was enormous! Wish this came in an XS if this is their sizing!,0
2,"these are pictured with what looks like an adult, but they are so tiny they are really more appropriate for a child. Not thrilled about the deceptive advertising.",0
4,Solid watch looks good,1
5,The fit was great the turtleneck was soft and does stretch. Overall was a good buy. Thank you,1
1,These are horrible I ordered my size from the size chart and they did not fit they were too small and so hard to get on they also had a really weird padding,0
4,I really like this watch...wish the face a just a tad bigger.,1
1,"Had to return, this coat ran way too small",0
3,"They are a little difficult to put on, other than that they do raise my feet off the concrete. I think I personally need just a hair more arch support and more relief on the ball of the foot. But I do like this shoe so far.",0
5,No problems,1
4,Beautiful. Runs very smooth. No stretch to material.,1
5,It's really cute on and looks just as it is pictured.,1
3,"Finding the right fit has become a huge challenge on the on-line shopping.  After review many products similar and owner stating it was to small went size WAAYYY UP.....big mistake. I own a shirt w/o zipper XL, great fit for 43 chest 33 waist.....freakin hard time taking it off......hence the zipper at XXL. TOOO LARGE. Once it goes on sale I'll get another one LARGE. The product does make you sweat!!!!",0
1,"Material very thin.  And sleeves were like for baby arms. It didn't come close to fitting.  Looked cheap, also.",0
1,So tiny,0
1,Muy cencillo de muy mala calidad,0
1,"The add says that the belt will fit a a person up to 49.6&#34; but the the belt will only fit a person up to 46&#34; thus making the belt worthless.<br />I also think you add is very miss leading,",0
4,Very nice!,1
1,These broke very easily and definitely weren't worth it,0
5,The first pair I ordered had loose lens. Their customer service was quick to respond to my concern and arranged for a replacement pair and return shipping. All before the holidays! The glasses look great and fit perfectly.  Unfortunately I loose my glasses a lot but I will not hesitate to make a other purchase in the future!,1
4,they keep the kids hands warm and dry,1
5,Beautiful dress,1
5,"Nice, confortable,  perfect for home.<br />I really love them..",1
1,"Purchased my size, had to give to my daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than I am.  She still looks like a roll of burst biscuits in them and she has a lovely figure.",0
4,"fits as expected if you read the reviews and order like 8 sizes up. I'm not a small gal but generally wear a large. 3XL in this suit. But it's cute. There's a funky vinegary smell that did not completely go away after the first wash, but has dissipated now that it has been washed several times.",1
1,Way to small. It was cute but definitely not a belly button ring. Be good for helix or ear,0
1,One day out of the box and the felt bottom is coming off the box.  Poor quality.,0
3,"Very glamorous yet relaxed look- Item is made of 75% TENCEL AND 25% COTTON.  However, Feels like a lower cotton cotent.  Item is exactly as pictured.  If you wear a ladies size 4, this size medium will probably fit you well.  I generally wear a ladies small.  I weigh 129 lbs., 5' 3"" tall, bust 36"" - item fit me perfectly as on model pictured,  and pant leg came to ankle.  Roomy in upper body, could accommodate larger bust and is fitted at waistline. Has deep pockets, lovely drape, and very stylish given the low price point.  I am disappointed to return but I am allergic to TENCEL and wanted to write this review to convey how very elegant item is but if you too are sensitive to TENCEL this jumper will probably not suit you.  I am rating it 3 stars instead of 5 because in my Amazon search for cotton denim jumpsuits this item was featured and therefore I ordered but it is in fact is made of composite fabric materials.  Lovely if you do not have Tencel sensitivity and are looking for a relaxed yet stylish jumpsuit.",0
1,Bad Size,0
4,"The pants and shirt was a shug fit across the chest , stomach area, maybe about a 1 1/2"" would make the outfit a more comfortable. The outer cape was perfect. The button holes on sleeves were to small, I couldn't button up the sleeves.",1
1,DIDNT come with batteries.,0
5,"Gave it to someone for a gift so I'm saying they loved it. I think they really did and it's pretty, but not made for people who have fat necks.",1
2,The fit is great. Not the right color.,0
3,"The dress was cute but didn‚Äôt really look like the photos, the color was a lot different and so was the style, it was more loose fitting",0
5,My granddaughter loves this purse.,1
5,A,1
1,Did not hold glasses well. They kept falling out of the holder on to the floor.  Threw it out,0
1,"As others have said- the material is just terrible. Like kite material or the material they make cheap high school graduation robes out of. It‚Äôs just awful.<br /><br />This dress would be great in design if they shortened the sleeves- right now they are a weird below the elbow length that makes the dress look like a priest‚Äôs robe. They should be a cute flutter sleeve length that comes to roughly halfway down the upper arm.<br /><br /> Between the weird sleeves and the cheap fabric, this almost looks like a costume robe someone would use in a high school theater production.",0
2,Not to bad kinda big for me,0
5,I wear a 10<br />I ordered 11 blue<br />Loved so much ‚ù§<br />I just bought  a 2nd pair white,1
5,OK so I've only had since yesterday and I'm already in love.<br /> Number one thing I will tell you I got a medium I usually would buy a large or an XL and a woman's tight T-shirt just letting you know but I got a medium and it's perfect it's not so oversized that it looks like I'm wearing somebody else's clothing does clothing but it's got enough space in it that I could wear a Winter sweater and other thicker clothing underneath it.<br /> The interior is super soft the extra is perfectly comfy and warm but not so warm that I'm overheated in I'm overheated in it sitting in the evening in the summer in South Carolina<br /> Someone mentioned they had a hard time pushing the sleeves up I didn't seem to have this problem it did take a little bit of pushing but now I've got them set so they will push up when I need to.<br /> I got the bright blue one and I think I want the black 1 the red 1 the Gray 1 and the green 1 now<br /> The only problem is that $50 is a little bit out of my place range to buy multiple items that form the same function.<br /> Though I would love to get at least a black one.<br /> This comes to just below mid calf on me in a size medium I saw photos of someone who was taller than me wearing one that came to their ankles and they were ordered at large just to let you know.<br /> The pockets are awesome my phone fits in there and I was actually able to stick a whole bag of pretzels a full sized bag of pretzels in there earlier today when I had to carry him through the house and I had my hands full.<br /> But they're made in such a way that nothing falls out.<br /> So that's really cool.<br /><br />I'm a big fan already of this item and I will probably be wearing it quite a bit daily I would say so<br /> That's kind of why I'd like to get the black one too because it goes with more things than the blue 1 does but the blue 1 matches my crocs there are almost exactly the same blue color.<br /> Definitely a big fan with definitely purchase again which suggests to anybody who likes big worm Cuddly sweatshirts this definitely fits the bill,1
5,Love it fits perfit have a couple colors great for summer,1
4,"This is a cute top but the colors are not as vivid as you would expect them to be. Still, love it though!",1
2,Cute style but the quality just isn‚Äôt there in person.  Especially for the prices of this brand.  Unfortunately the stitching where the straps are attached to the bag started to ripping the first time I used it.,0
3,"These socks have a strange fit - toes are too big, but grips barely cover heel. They are not cushioned at all - very thin. I'm a size 7 1/2 womens on the narrowish size. Would like the elastic around the edges to be better too. Overall I don't like and will not purchase again. However, the seller was very responsive and issued a refund, so I added a star.",0
1,The sock size is not realistic.,0
5,Absolutely love my new long sleeve shirt! I bought it to wear to a my first game and it was perfect! Thank you for designs that are out of the box and perfect!,1
4,Short waisted. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and it barely fit. But super cute for a rehearsal dinner matching our 2 year old.,1
4,Light wt. Easy to use.,1
5,My son is a combat engineer. He loves the tie.,1
5,Daughter loves it,1
3,This was a gift to my daughter and I had to go buy a new chain as the chain that came with it was like a choker chain.,0
5,Great,1
4,"I am 5'8&#34; 175 lbs. Large fit perfectly. Hits at my knee.<br /><br />As others have stated, the quality is low. I gave it a shot though and am pleased. It's more of a costume coat and although it's not perfect I love it a lot! This is exactly what I wanted.",1
3,"the shorts look great but the sizing chart is off. i order an xl but what i got was like 3 sizes under me, because these are imported from the U.K. and they use the Metric system.  so a xl will be a med size and not xl.",0
5,Love this ring--however it took 3-4 months to receive it!!!!  Never experienced anything like that before.,1
5,"This is one of my favorite PattyBoutik tops so far. Super cute and matches great with jeans and flats or heels. This shirt does run large for PattyBoutik if you normally buy her stuff. I wear M or L in her stuff but usually favor a L, I stayed with the M in this top and it's actually still a little loose but thats fine I like the way it fits. Hides all the bad spots ;)  I have included pictures for reference I am currently about 130 lbs, 5'3, 36D, 29&#34; waist. It washes fine I use machine wash cold and hang dry. I have accidentally thrown her tops in the dryer they will usually shrink cause most are rayon. What helps me not forget is I put all of her tops or anything I don't want in the dryer in a lingerie bag so I notice it and take it out before tossing it all in the dryer. Hopefully this helps people and this is how it fits me.",1
5,Yoga pants are very comfortable and fit true to size. I would order more in the future!,1
5,Nicely made and well cut fit.,1
1,I have average wrists (right between medium and large bone). Watch slid down to my knuckles. No way to fix it- rods are really stuck.,0
5,Great gift,1
1,"Completely see through and covered in makeup stains, also about 4 sizes too small",0
4,"The skirt is long for my average height 2 year old.  Other than that, completely adorable.",1
5,My son in law is happy about their gift,1
5,love love,1
1,Its so small. This neckless came from wish! It took to long and one of the rinestones was missing.,0
5,My 8 year old granddaughter loves her new nightgown! It‚Äôs soft and comfortable and fits great!!,1
2,I like this because of the blue on it and the N as it is my initial but it was very thin and small. After just a few weeks the clasp started popping open.,0
5,wrap sweetheart,1
5,Statement necklace I love it every time i wear it i get compliments about the roman glass and the sterling silver Is awesome. I own many pieces from this seller all of them beautiful.,1
1,It had a terrible crease and bend in the front that made it look terrible. Returned one and reordered. Same deal with the replacement if not a little worse.,0
1,Very small.  Sizing runs small,0
5,Cool bandana. Fits my big head.,1
3,Ok,0
1,The image presented is very misleading. The fabric is of lightweight polyester so the structure and quality of the pants are extremely cheap. I believe that Amazon should hold these companies accountable for the product they sell in comparison to the product they display. Half of the companies are nonrefundable. They should be held for such fraudulent acts.,0
5,"These socks fit as expected, have the grippy pads, come in a variety of colors, and are a great value for the price.",1
5,"Buy them you won't regret it so classy and stylish modern, great quality and love the note so lovely totally recommend!!!",1
4,A little larger than expected but very pretty,1
1,Leaks,0
5,"I like them.  They make a statement, and are versatile with a lot of different outfits.",1
1,"Thus fit as expected, however the quality of the material was not as expected. very disappointing.",0
2,The material is nice.The fit is weird.Has alot of stretch.The neck area is cut weird.The stitching is terrible.Pass on this one.,0
1,They tore a hole in the finger first time worn üëéand to late for refund I‚Äôm disappointed,0
1,Unbelievable!  Used for the first time. Side bracket broke off and cut up my husbands leg with a screw that was left. Next one of the wheels fell off. Worst luggage we‚Äôve ever used. We are still on vacation and now need to look into buying a suitcase to make it home. DO NOT BUY!,0
5,The fit of these shirts is great!!,1
1,Size is disappointing.  I ordered 3 pair of 2X all 3 pair bottoms were about size 14...Tops fit perfectly. Because I recently purchased 2 pair of Joe Boxer2X that both top and bottom fit I was assured that the mismatch in fit was Not due to my personal proportion problem.  kk,0
3,I wanted to love this. I wear a 38C in bras and the cups were incredibly small. My girls were fell straight out of the bottom and we're smashed flat when in the proper location.  It fit around perfectly so I would guess it would be for a much small cup size with around a 36-38 band size.  It is cute and fairly durable though!,0
1,Bought two of them in June or July of this year.....Both stopped working....won't run on battery or electricity.....?????,0
5,"Nice swing dress. Fits as expected. The material was slightly thicker than expected, which is good because then the dress isn't too sheer and seems like it will hold up.",1
5,Was brought for part of my Granddaughter graduation gift she loved it good quality & silver still lasting....,1
1,Very cheaply made. I wore one out and the clasp broke after the first use. Went to wear another one and the chain in the back fell off before I even put it on. I'm slender and the chokers weren't tight to my neck. Spend a little more money and buy better quality chokers elsewhere.,0
4,Very good and confort,1
1,"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear at her alice in wonderland bday party. My daughter is only 10, we were intending on safety pinning the sides so it fit her enough for the party then let her grow into it. It was tight,  (but not overly tight, just way tighter than it should have been), then she doesn't have it on 10 minutes and the seem rips all the way down the zipper. We had to put a sweater on her for the party to hide the hole, kind of ruining the alice look we were going for. I don't have lots of extra money to spend, especially on useless items.",0
5,Loved the sneakers. Really comfortable.,1
1,Does not fit to curve of face,0
3,Ok,0
3,I mostly got this pack for the leaf looking nose ring however it‚Äôs so small it‚Äôs kinda uncomfortable when you don‚Äôt get it set in the right place. It‚Äôs supper cute and shiny but wish it was a bit bigger.,0
1,I ordered a 2-3T for my daughter and the top that arrived was so large it fit me. (5‚Äô6‚Äù 107#) ridiculously off sized.,0
2,The band was a good material but the clasps were almost defective. Would not release easily.,0
3,Cute shoes but I had a horrible smell,0
5,"Everything fits, even my galaxy s7. Love it.",1
5,Comfy and great to wear with a comfy t-shirt,1
1,Awful product but I guess it's true...you pay for what you get!!! I do not recommend these!!! And yes I returned them.,0
5,Son and friend loved them,1
5,Cute dress!  Can dress it up or down!  Comfortable and fit as expected!,1
5,Good quality,1
1,Way too small and too short.  Go a size or tow up from what you actually are.,0
4,Got this for my wife on xmas.  She says it is comfortable and loves the lights.  I had to return the first one.  The battery would not charge.  Second one is working.  The lights are pretty cool looking.  The button on the battery pack switches the animation of the lights.  The battery pack is pretty small and fits in a pocket on the inner side of the beanie.,1
5,"Good quality, but the small fits more like a medium... not bad.. just for your information. I would have liked to know.",1
5,Super soft and comfortable.,1
5,Nice and warm. A nice house slipper,1
5,It‚Äôs very nice<br />And high quality.<br />Is it Navajo<br />Or Zuni.<br /><br />I gave it as a gift<br />She loves it,1
1,Child wore for about a week and pin broke out of strap.  2nd watch bought. Child lost 1st one because of this issue the 1st time. Child is 12.,0
3,"Too small, had to return it",0
3,Had to add blouse clip so my tits wouldn‚Äôt pop out,0
5,Fits my face wonderfully,1
5,slow delivery but good item for price,1
5,Fits just fine,1
5,"Love the color, fit, and style! Great buy for a great price.",1
5,Nice fit and material. Not navy but close to the teal in the picture which was perfect. I will be ordering again in more colors.,1
3,"The color is just what was expected. The softness was great. The quality of thickness was very poor; therefore, I was disappointed for it was to be a gift to my granddaughter. L. Hardin",0
1,they fall off and dont screw in after a couple uses,0
1,"I normally wear a size Large but when ordering online I tend to go a size up so ordered an XL, it doesn't fit at all.",0
5,little small fitting,1
2,Cute shoes. Love the look when in I first got them. However the more you wear them the more they stretch out. Material of poor quality. Probably will have to throw them away after this season due to so loose on my feet now after stretching,0
5,"Great product, timely delivery",1
5,For my wife.,1
1,Very cheap material! The shoulder elastic is so tight that one arm moment and it snap over your shoulders. Does not stay off the shoulders and is extremely sheer (see through).,0
1,"No give in sleeves, very tight",0
4,Both stylish and functional!,1
5,THESE FIT WELL ON THE PERSON GIFTED.  MAYBE A LITTLE SNUG AT THE TOP BUT I FIND THAT IN MOST SOCKS AS THE COMPANIES MAKING THEM THINK THE SOCKS NEED TO BE REALLY TIGHT TO STAY UP.  AND THESE WILL CLEARLY LAST LONGER THAN THE THINLY MADE COTTON SOCKS.,1
5,Good quality. Keeps my glasses safe in my purse.,1
3,"Not as big as I expected.  I would have liked to have a deeper bag. It feels more like a big purse than a tote. I bought this to take to work on a daily basis and even though is appears very well made, not big enough for my purpose.",0
2,Took almost 2 months to deliver. It was a birthday gift. Beats the purpose when‚Äôs it‚Äôs arrives a month after the birthday or more,0
4,it's very pretty but the fabric is very thin.,1
5,This is one of my favorite outfits that my daughter wears,1
5,I had to order frames and lenses for my new Rx after scratching my lenses and didnt want to discard my frames worth over $150. These came quickly and exceeded my expectations!,1
3,[[VIDEOID:3fcb964b46be8192a64a1496a0ab2441]] Cute but fades after a few months.,0
5,Love it,1
2,Much smaller than I wanted.,0
5,wears it daily,1
5,"I was reading from some reviewers that it's too lite, too cheap, etc. I bought 2 for $14!  What do you expect?  And I love them!  They are light and airy and really really comfortable.  I bought 2 more and went up a size though in case they shrink when I wash them.  They don't hug your mid-section either so it makes them super cool.  I will wear them in the gym, running outside, etc. If you're expecting a substantial t-shirt, this isn't it. But it is lightweight (like it says), and feels like you barely have a shirt on.",1
3,"I am 5'8"" tall and ordered a large of this dress.  The elastic waist of the dress is very high up, causing the cinched waist to sit around my rib cage.  As a result, the dress was not very flattering.  Additionally, the fabric feels very cheap and plastic-y and after two washes I was unable to remove the wrinkles that were in it from shipping.  I so wanted this dress to fit well, as I think it is very cute.",0
5,"I really love how it fits, looks and stretch",1
1,These do not fit standard ear piercings.,0
1,"Torso of this suit was waaaaaay too long and I consider myself to have a long torso as it is. I am 5'8 180lbs.  Also not feeling the circle things in the bra area... I mean who's boobs are shaped like that anyways. Super cute suit, SUPER disappointed on how it fit",0
2,The feel of the material was not desirable.  It didn't feel like the soft cotton I was hoping for.,0
5,Cute earrings. I would recommend,1
2,Bottoms are not  good design. The band doesn't stretch.,0
1,I bought a purple one in 2x and it fit me perfectly. I bought this black one after in the same size and it can‚Äôt fit me. What is this!?,0
5,"Adorable product, very satisfied",1
5,Love these dresses!  So comfy and cute!  I‚Äôve ordered a couple.,1
2,Like others have stated the pull tab broke. Mine only lasted a week before it broke,0
3,"I REALLY wanted to like this shirt. The colour is perfect, the fit is perfect, the front looks amazing. But the back- the straps are twisted in a way that I don‚Äôt like. So, if you‚Äôre not obsessed with perfect straps that aren‚Äôt twisted up then you will probably really love this tank.",0
5,Scarf was beautiful and everything I was hoping for with the print.,1
1,"I love how this necklace and bracelet look, but unfortunately the bracelet rubnerband broke in less than 2 weeks! Very disappointing.",0
1,Working on a refund.,0
3,Super cute but be careful....mine broke within a couple days. The material is cheap and mouth from fish to fish breaks VERY easily. Don't bend it too much.,0
4,"This is absolutely GORGEOUS. I couldn't wait to try it on when it arrived. Its extremely figure flattering. The only reason why it didn't get the 5 stars is because 1, its entirely TOO long on me (I'm 5'1) so I have to have it hemmed, and 2, the romper portion is a little short which can cause wedgies and/or camel toe (not noticeable to the eye, but you can definitely feel it rising up there). I ordered a size up (XL) based on the reviews but If you have a long torso (which I don't), this isn't going to be comfy on you. Trust me.  On the upside, I cannot wait to wear this out!! Im going to feel/look Fantabulous!!!",1
5,"Fits like a t-shirt dress & wasnt terribly see-through (although I always wear nude under white).<br />The lace also lasted & wasn't cheap, so that's a nice bonus too.",1
5,This is a great replacement band that I purchased for my new vivoactive 4s. It is comfortable and high quality. I wear it every day and I don‚Äôt need to worry about switching out my watch bands between work and workouts. Great purchase!,1
2,These are cute and comfortable but too big. They keep falling down my nose.,0
1,"dont buy these shoes. they are not true to size for American feet. they do not look like the photo that is posted and the shoe arrived in the mail so late that I had actually forgot that i ordered them! but the good part was that i reached out to the seller and they refunded me my money back, and i ended up giving the shoes to Good Will. Your experience my turn out better than mine if it does then maybe you can give a better review of the shoes than i could.",0
3,They slip off because they are heavy. I got the black for a funeral and my neck was rubbed raw by the jewels on it after a few hours.,0
5,"Love them, all four fit perfectly and look awesome!",1
5,I love this top.  I won't be wearing it for a cover up.  I am wearing it as a shirt.  I just have a tank top underneath or whatever looks good from my closet underneath.  This is quality material and stitching.  I was so happy to see that I got exactly what was pictured.  I will be buying from this company again indeed.  I recommend this blouse Completely.  I didn't put up a picture Because it is Exactly AS SHOWN.,1
1,"It fell apart easily, and looks very cheap - It went into the trash.",0
5,It makes the regular fitbit 2 band look upscaled!,1
5,Russell quality.  The greatest.,1
4,"It's a little smaller than expected, but the seller warned of this so I ordered above babies size, and I'm glad I did because this outfit is super cute!",1
5,Bought this as a gift. I was very please when i saw it. It's very beautiful and sparkles a lot in the light!,1
2,"I bought this to wear to a wedding and ended up wearing something else. For reference: I am 5'3"" - 140lbs - 34B chest with bigger hips. I ordered a Small (which is what I normally wear in more flowy dresses because I need the top to be fitted). The top was loose at the shoulders and under my arms and looked terrible. Then, the front of the dress was soooo short. Last, the material was not forgiving AT ALL. Very unflattering. It was just a mess all around on my body.",0
5,My friend really liked it. Her daughter is attending Clark.,1
2,Did not come with bangle,0
5,Ordered a small and the gloves fit great with soft supple leather. Quality is nice and the button accents are a pretty design. Touch screen works without the harsh smell I've experienced from other touch treated products.,1
3,Snags on dresses with lace.,0
1,It would have been a nice Multi-Layer Leather Bracelet if the Alloy Magnetic Clasp had not been defective.  On the plus side I was refunded by amazon as soon as I mailed back the defective bracelet.,0
3,"Loved the sayings, just runs a little on the small size",0
5,"Very delicate and feminine. At first I was a bit hesitant because the stone looked peach, not pink. However, once it was on, the color came through. Lots of compliments.",1
4,"I thought it would be over one shoulder, but it‚Äôs not! The neck is too small and  thats why I just like it not love it at all!",1
1,The picture is not what you get. You only get one skirt a bow a set earrings a bowl. Unlike the pictures shows lots of stuff I would say you get about a $1 worth of accessories.,0
5,Definitely worth the cheap ass price. It‚Äôs so warm and comfortable. High quality material surprisingly. I‚Äôll absolutely be buying more,1
5,Love this Tunic. Material is very soft and drapes nicely on the body.,1
5,"This material is outstanding- moisture wicking, lightweight, and comfortable. The padding is adequate and the style looks great. We had to order a couple different sizes before settling on the youth 14 for my 11 yr old who is 58 inches tall and weighs 118 lb",1
5,I am writing well,1

5,"Stylish, great for cloudy days. Or clear night driving",1
1,Have not even had these two weeks and the ear piece broke off.  Was hoping they would last longer than Gas station sun glasses...,0
1,The set is beautiful and I looked forward to wearing them. I've worn ear cuffs for years but never had a problem like this. They just don't stay on my ear. I think the wrap portion is too small to hold to the ear.,0
3,I love the shirts with pockets but I was disappointed when I saw the color was actually purple.....on Amazon it says it's blue.  It definitely isn't blue at all.,0
5,"I use to buy these at the jeweler . But it‚Äôs so much easier ordering on line.<br />They work great, and I can leave them on for a couple days",1
4,You can see every little imperfection when the wind blows.,1
1,This items are used not new at all with scratches and dents,0
5,Kept the rain off of her and it's good for when they go to the school,1
3,"Cooking apron is overall nice, but quite short!",0
5,Purchased this money belt for recent European trip and it was perfect.<br />It was comfortable but not too big for holding cash and passport.,1
5,It is a very pretty dress and looks exactly like the pic/ I will buy other colors. The fabric is good and stretches just enough to fit well around your curves. I love it,1
3,The watch is very ordinary without the band & that is what I now have because the band didn't even last a year before it wore out.,0
2,cute to wear with heels but they look extremely out of place otherwise,0
5,Love this dress,1
1,made for a small frame man. Cheaply made,0
5,Runs large.,1
5,Fantastic,1
5,Awesome! looks great and has a nice heavy feel to it!,1
5,"I really love these Vivicastle dresses. I have the Navy floral, White floral and Leopard print dresses. All in size medium and they fit exactly how I want it to fit (not to tight and to loose). For reference 32C/29 waist/38 hips, 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 120 pounds. The fabric is a very soft, comfortable stretchy polyester. I like to wear the floral ones during the day and the leopard print one for night. This midi dress makes you feel classy & ladylike. I seem to have gotten the most compliments so far on the white floral dress. It‚Äôs a great dress to throw on to go to the mall, especially if your trying on clothes and you want something that‚Äôs easy on and off. Also, they are great for traveling since it takes up very little room when rolled up and no need for ironing either! I highly recommended it! üòä",1
5,My granddaughter loves it.  That‚Äôs good enough for me,1
5,Beautiful...I wear this even over T-shirt‚Äôs to dress up the outfit a little. Super cute!,1
5,I have tried many similar -- these are the best!,1
5,Loved it. Was exactly as advertised.,1
5,Gorgeous! So beautiful and well made!,1
2,I bought a 4xl and its small. Looks more like large,0
5,For a friend. She absolutely loves it. Very pretty wire wrapping.,1
5,about a size of a dime. perfect for charms,1
1,Too big on my grandson,0
5,"These earrings arrived early and they are so beautiful! Our family has lost several loved ones over the last few months and I thought these would be a perfect way to remember them. When they got here, I loved them so much, I ordered three more pair the same day! They will make great gifts for other family members. I would very highly recommend these to anyone.",1
5,Love em and my feet say thank youüòÄ,1
2,"These are beautiful but the hook is very cheap and easily bends and won't latch. Also, the beads are loose with nothing to keep them in place. When I unlatched it for the first time to put them on, half the beads fell off never to be found again and the latch bent so it wouldn't relatch. When I get a chance, I will replace the hooks with a stronger one and fix the problem with the beads so they won't slide.",0
3,This bra is really pretty. Fit fine first day. When I slept in it though it dug into my back really bad..,0
1,"Too small,  material is cheap and it costs double to return it",0
5,"Wedding party shoes x 6, all were true to size and girls said was comfortable!",1
5,Sold construction and quite flattering - wife loved it!,1
4,I ORDERED A MEDIUM AND NEVER KNOW WHAT EXPECT BUT IT IS PERFECT.  IT IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUT I THINK THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE STYLE.,1
3,"These fit well and the material is decent enough. But, as others have stated, the thumb hole is very tiny and obviously just snipped in with scissors. There is a hasty stitch around the edge of the hole, I assume to keep it from fraying, but I'm going to have to enlarge the hole anyway, so that stitch isn't going to help at all (not that it would help for long even if I left it as is... ). 99% certain these started as a forearm sleeves. They will do the job, and they were inexpensive, but I am not impressed.",0
3,"Product quality was spot on but the sizing was a bit off, choose a larger size especially if you muscular",0
5,These worked great. Water did not go in. :),1
1,It was to small,0
3,It looks just like the pictures & fits perfectly the only thing i did not like was the quality and fabric the shirt was made out of. I haven‚Äôt worn it yet because of the weather.,0
1,These are tragic. They have very little elastic to hold them up and so they roll down your leg. I'm very disappointed and I can't return them so that makes everything even better...,0
4,Watch is easy to use. Only wish I could answer calls on the watch. And the battert life last til about evening hrs but if used alot it drains fast,1
1,Tiny,0
5,I am a gear head and retired woman machinist. I am getting all kinds of ideas for jewelry and accenting fashions. I am a graduate of Purdue University with an Apparel Design and Technology degree. I learned lots of fun things there for design.,1
1,"Absolutely hate, way too small and didn't work.",0
2,Too large for number of earrings it holds.  Leaves could have been larger to hold more earrings and better spacing.  Butterflies just for looks. Returned item for refund.,0
1,Very cheaply made.<br />Plastic face cover fell off immediately.<br />Buttons do not compress to set time.<br />Disappointed.,0
3,Ok. Nice,0
2,The sellers should let you mismatch sizes because my top fit & my bottom couldn‚Äôt even go over my butt so now I have to return the entire thing. However it is really nice.,0
4,Very comfy! I received several compliments the first time I wore it.,1
3,My husband did not like these.  He said they were extremely uncomfortable.,0
1,Nice coat but way to small,0
4,"I really love this shirt because it‚Äôs very unique. The fit is exactly as expected if you use your measurements and follow the sellers size chart. The material of the shirt is nice, it‚Äôs not too thick or thin. The shirt is made with quality there are no loose strings or uneven stitching. The only problem I have with the shirt is that I ordered black but what I received isn‚Äôt what the picture shows. The shirt I received in the color black is more of a dark grey or dark charcoal it‚Äôs definitely not what is shown as the black in the picture. I did double check and my package had the color listed as black but it‚Äôs definitely closer to grey in color.",1
1,The sizing is way off.,0
3,Good quality shirts. Definitely a bit small though.,0
3,Runs a little smsll,0
3,It wasn't color she excepted but likes OK.,0
5,"I am forever on the hunt for feminine-looking apple watch bands, and there is a lot to love about this pretty band.  The trellis embellishments are delicate and lovely and the gold color is shimmery but not over the top.  The quality of the leather material feels great; it's thin but not paper thin.  It feels durable but not bulky.  Even better: the clasp is relatively thin so it's not annoying to type with the band on.  I replaced the silver adapters with rose gold adapters to better match my watch.<br /><br />I thought the band was quite true to the photos.  If you think the band is your taste based on the product photos and the user photos here, you will be pleased with the build quality and quality of the materials.<br /><br />I'll keep this review updated so if the band does not wear well over time, I'll let you know.",1
5,Colors look good and materials seem quality.,1
4,"After a 3 days without using the watch , you have to set time and date.<br />I‚Äôm giving a four star ‚≠êÔ∏è because I have receive 2 compliments.",1
5,"As a hijabi, I have to help out my modest dressers! Get this dress!!!! It‚Äôs so beautiful and the only thing I need to adjust is maybe stitching closed the very bottom slit opening at the front of the dress , which shows the ankle a little. Otherwise the material and everything, is perfect staple to have. I didn‚Äôt see reviews prior to buying but took a chance. I took a XLarge size and it fit just right, although I think XXL would have been great too. It‚Äôs more slim fit, and flowy on bottom. 5‚Äô7 and usually wear a size 10 in jeans",1
5,Gift,1
5,"As depicted, and arrived prior to stated delivery date.",1
1,Bought a pair of these last year for my grandson and loved them. this year not so much the rubber came off around The eye part and did not keep a seal very disappointed,0
5,Exactly as &#34;advertised&#34; and very satisfactory.,1
5,Great product. Really good quality,1
5,"This romper is SUPER cute!!! Fits great! I ordered a medium! 5‚Äô7 150. I don‚Äôt like my shorts rompers long so this was a good length.  There was a surprising opening on the side with a shoulder, but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal on. I just wasn‚Äôt expecting it.",1
5,"This watch exceeded my expectations!  The watch arrived beautifully packaged and included a Burei gift bag. The look, quality and styling are well done and it looks fantastic on your wrist.  I have several different brands of watches and I am happy to have added this Burei to my collection.",1
2,Cute jewelry but way to small,0
1,Ordered a size 2 dress fits up to a 6. Not a 2 not a good product.,0
3,"I love the colors in this dress! However, the fabric stretches weirdly across the bust, & is a little tight under the arms. I still wear this dress a lot though & get a lot of compliments.",0
3,it‚Äôs exactly like the picture but it was a bit big. Not super big on me but definitely wasn‚Äôt snug like how it should be. kinda wide in the boob area so it‚Äôs not ideal for smaller chests,0
3,"The shirt is made with a comfortable and breathable fabric, it is lightweight and allows for good movement.<br />The shirt is well-constructed but is made with low-quality materials. It has a variety of designs, colors, and styles to choose from to cater to different preferences. The shirt is not be suitable for cold weather and is not as durable as some other brands on the market.",0
1,"Notbof good quality, color change.",0
5,Looks good and my girlfriend says it feels good ..bought it for her as a gift she is in love ...u can also adjust the size big or small,1
4,"I ordered the navy, beautiful color, great fit, except for the ""built in boobs"".<br />If you can't totally fill it out, you may want to reconsider...it's like wearing a bra that's too big, you can pull it off, it just doesn't form to your body.",1
3,"These aren't bad for the price, but the seems are huge and obvious under the mesh, and they dyed my fingers black.",0
1,"Poor quality, the stitching was uneven and messy, the picker in the back that is supposed to be over the butt was on the upper back so it looked very awkward instead of cute. I was not happy so I  returned it",0
5,Fits great and flatters well.  Goes great with my Lularoe Leggings,1
5,Perfect color for all my game gear.,1
2,"It looks like it was screen printed by an amateur in their bedroom. It‚Äôs OK to buy it, just have a low expectations.",0
1,You would have to be only 105 lbs to get these on. I ordered EX. They were actually for my husband. Couldn‚Äôt get them on his swollen feet.,0
4,"I love how deep the pockets are and that they don't bulg out, the color was more of a fuschia than anything else, pretty vibrant which is something new for me, I wear more black and grey things by this was a fun find and I will probably get another one in a different color!",1
1,"I don‚Äôt know what I expected, but it was cheap looking.",0
5,"extremely high quality.  I know it seems pricey, but it won't when you receive the product and see the quantity of wool and the fit and finish.  I have no idea how this product is made so inexpensively.  Apparently there's a wool factory somewhere in China that is very advanced and efficient.<br /><br />I bought it for a 12 hour summit day in freezing weather.  Now that I have it, my only concern is that I'll be too warm while climbing, even possibly with just a rain shell over it. Even if it proves to be overkill for climbing, it will still be extremely valuable to me for cold camping.",1
1,Charm fell off right away and it was very hard to open the coffin,0
5,Great socks - not as thick as I expected which I am now glad!  Very comfortable.,1
1,"The photo and price makes<br />You think this is a big box, it is not!!! Returning. This is a 5 dollar bag of diapers. The brand is awesome, this price is crazy.",0
5,Cute! My nephew loved this keychain!,1
1,Not good for anyone over the age of 5 these are small,0
5,I really like these face masks. I am using them to cover mouth and nose while social distancing during the Covid pandemic. I highly recommend using these masks.,1
4,These look great. The problem is they need something soft at the tips. They fit great but will scar your face if you are not careful because of the unprotected sharp tips.,1
2,The smell wasn't quite what I expected but it doesn't last at all<br />Disapointed,0
5,Good hat keeps my head and ears  warm here in the north,1
4,"As an advid Lululemon guru, I was skeptical of these leggings, however, in my search for the color I thought I'd give them a try.<br /><br />I am absolutely in love with these leggings and they are a dupe of the Align. I have several pairs and my husband actually thought these were the ""more pricier brand"".<br /><br />I am looking forward to more colors - the quality is excellent - a must buy!<br /><br />IG: @msmingvm",1
5,I love it and the way it fits,1
4,"I really love the color, and they look great, but they seemed more like a large than an extra large. Yes, they are stretchy, but they may look as tight as the skin on a grape if you are a 14-wide. If you don't like polyester -even lightweight, non-scratchy polyester- you may not like these pants. I am not a fan of polyester, but these are OK if the weather is cool.",1
5,"Bought as a gift for grandson, he loved it!!!! Shirt is very good quality, and was fast shipping.",1
3,Smaller than I expected,0
3,"Such a cute dress, just not for busty ladies! I‚Äôm a D cup and this dress just didn‚Äôt cover them at all.",0
1,Did not arrive with the actual Disney font as advertised,0
5,"Quartz watches drift typically 15-30 seconds a month. You can get down to a few seconds, but more by luck than design. The PR100 is a treat. Swiss and each Tissot movement is certified by the COSC. Tissot is paying for this so they make sure it exceeds their tolerances and that makes for a quality watch. Original price was $550 and $165 is a good price for a certified Swiss watch. For the 9 days I've had it, it hasn't drifted more than a second. There was an issue with the second hand not hitting the second marks, but I've seem to luck out. I was impressed enough to get the gold version. Nice to have a watch that you can put away for a couple of months and it's still keeping good time.",1
5,Nice material soft,1
2,"I did not get the ones that I ordered. Pretty disappointed. The socks seem fine, but still pretty upset.",0
5,"Great fit, arrived quickly.  Very stylish.",1
5,Just as cute as it looks. It is comfortable to wear and the two snaps make it adjustable.,1
3,"Not as good as they looked. Poor quality. But, ok.",0
3,"Maybe if you‚Äôre built like the model but if you have a normal waist circumference I‚Äôm not so sure. Wearing the two pieces together I felt self conscious / like I was getting stares on a run around my neighborhood, but if you‚Äôre more confident then go for it. I‚Äôm a 34B and the medium top gapes a little bit on me, I definitely have to wear with a supportive sports bra if working out. I wish the top was 2 inches longer. The shorts fit great, flattering on my butt and don‚Äôt pinch my waist (27in). SHORT short though, not like normal bike shorts, and they roll up when you run. It‚Äôs nice quality tho, thick. I think I‚Äôll likely wear the shorts with an oversized cropped jacket or the shirt with high waisted leggings, but not both pieces together as it‚Äôs a little much. 5‚Äù8 and 127 lbs for reference.",0
3,I do like this dress but very tight in the bust.  I considered keeping it but would be very uncomfortable.  I loved everything else about it though.,0
5,"I am very happy with this bag and intend to use it for weekend travel.  I have a larger one for longer trips but it is too large to use if just going for a day or two so.  The material is soft and it appears well sewn.  All of the zippers work and there are several compartments in which to keep your items organized.  I like that it has a hook so that it can be hung on the back of the bathroom door or in a closet, freeing up space on the counter.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this bag at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",1
2,"They have some sort of hair all over them it comes off like dog hair and sticks to your jacket, pants, etc",0
5,"Dress fit well, and arrived as described. The top material is firm/tight and fits snug. I'm an XL 16/18 and I saw this as a benefit, hugging in those little &#34;back rolls&#34; many of us have. Haha! The skirt material was more lighterweight and provided comfort in the summer heat. The colors were true to the photos I think and I've received many compliments already. Also, with the wrap top, this would be a GREAT dress for a nursing mom! Those years are past us now, but that was my first thought when I tried it on.",1
5,works like a .. Charm!,1
5,The dress was just as expected. I am 5‚Äô6 and 130 pounds. I usually wear a medium but I always get scared that my boobs won‚Äôt fit because I‚Äôm a 32A-B. But this dress fit them perfect and not tight. You will need to wear seamless panties or a seamless thong. Not short at all.  I am 21 years old. I went to the store to find a valentines look and everything was like to go to clubs and I wanted a more adult look and this fit just right. Also it is like double fabric which makes it thicker,1
5,...very pleased.!<br /> will  buy from this (store) GUIDE GEAR<br />  AGAIN.!!!!,1
4,"I tried this in a large to extra, extra, extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color.  They also wash well in a lingerie bag but I lay them flat to dry.",1
1,"Basically a tissue tee in tunic length. Don‚Äôt buy. The black one wasn‚Äôt even a nice rich black. Looked like that brown black. The pink was not the blush pink I expected either. Just don‚Äôt. I bought the 2xl because I read to size up for a looser fit, but it was smaller than the xl I bought from another brand.",0
5,"Great quality for the price! Perfect size.. I have a two year old so I can easily hold diapers and other things like that, along with my things. Will definitely purchase other bags from this brand.",1
3,I thought it was hard cork but it's not. But it's a cool bag.,0
5,"Greatest item that ever hit the streets. These night driving gkasses are a plus! No glare, no streaks from oncoming vehicles, makes night driving in the rain so much easier!",1
3,"These socks are amazing in theory, and they wash well, but they are very distorted once I put them on. Once stretched even slightly, the image is almost unrecognizable.",0
1,"As soon as I received the item, I found that the button was broken.  Very pretty watch but it's also big.",0
3,"Did not like this on me, that being said I'm not a huge fan of wearing dresses period. Trying to find something to wear for an upcoming event. This was too large and baggy.",0
4,"I got the xl size upon reading the reviews.  they are just right, i wish it was a bit lose but it is a compression tank.  need it for walking.  it is thin but not see thru.  for the price i would say that it is a good buy",1
1,"Grossly undersized. At least two sizes too small. Also, it is not a sweatshirt as it appears. Just a cheaply made shirt with a hood. The item arrived a full month late and then they charged me to return it. Not a good experience in any form.",0
5,I purchased a white & gray for my daughter to wear during lessons. They kept her cool & the sun blocked. She is 97lbs & 5‚Äô6‚Äù and the xs was a little long & loose. Not so much to get in her way but definitely not fitted.,1
5,Good product. Kids love it,1
4,Very comfortable,1
3,Doesn‚Äôt have the built in hand mittens as the regular Carters PJs and material is thin material.,0
5,Nicely done,1
3,I should have looked closer to the way it looked in photo....not that crazy about it and it wasnt cheap,0
3,I particularly loved this design. When I received it I was pleasantly  surprised. Looks beautiful.,0
4,I ordered these for my boyfriend and he loves how durable and comfortable they are.,1
1,There is no stretch. I usually wear an XL I got a XXL and could barely get it over my hips.  The material split down the front the first time I wore it because it had no stretch. I do not recommend this product.,0
2,Much much smaller than expected. The quality is really good but not the size,0
1,Broke in a month.,0
3,its a mask,0
3,Small,0
2,This bra is not made to hold DDD in place during jumping jacks.,0
5,Satisfied!,1
5,Great quality for the price.,1
3,"I thought I was receiving a black beanie but instead received a tan one.  The stark contrast between the tan cap and the white ""ear covers"" takes the cap from a different kind look and makes it a ridiculous look.  Had they kept the two parts similarly colored I think it would look much better.  The tan beanie seems to be the only one they used separate coloring on...",0
1,"Terrible quality, this shirt was spandex not the waxed cotton cloth dashikis are typically made from.  Great price for an inferior product.",0
5,It is just what I was looking for. Fits well and is long enough,1
5,It looks great on my desk and does the job I wanted!,1
1,Perfect if you‚Äôre a size 1 & 100 lbs.  way too small for me 150 lbs size 12.,0
1,Huge pockets which show under the fabric and look very tacky.,0
2,If pictures speak a thousand words then here are a few.  Even the free pouch was defective. The materials the pack is made of are decent but the stitching is not. Just like all other none brand name packs.,0
5,"I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction.",1
5,"I was wary of buying sight unseen, but figured with free returns, YOLO. So glad I did. The fit was spot on. I am 5'e&#34;, 145 lbs, and fairly active/toned (4-6 days a week on average). My husband's face lit up when he saw it on. Totally worth it!",1
5,I loved this charm.,1
2,"First, the good. I love the design of this jacket and the golden yellow is an excellent color! The fit is stylish, not too baggy but also roomy enough for layers when necessary. I‚Äôve worn it in a few downpours so far and it has performed very well as my waterproof outer layer while working outside!<br /><br />That being said, I‚Äôve had a couple issue so far. The first one they sent had a non functional zipper on the left hand pocket. I requested a replacement, so no lasting issue there. However, I was rounding a corner today and the lightly bumped into it only to realize a few minutes later when my arm was starting to get wet that the material on my left sleeve had torn open! I want to be clear, I barely skimmed the corner and now have a 3‚Äôx3‚Äô tear in the sleeve of my jacket. I want to love this jacket, but it‚Äôs simply not durable enough for me to be ready to replace it considering a light skimming of a slightly rugged corner resulted in such a large tear.<br /><br />Overall, I‚Äôd really like to rate this higher due to it‚Äôs stylishness and excellent waterproof performance but really can‚Äôt considering how flimsy the material turned out to be. I‚Äôd love to hear from the company on this and will update my review if anything changes.",0
4,"Ordered a medium. Super warm, shapely, and the arms were just the right length for my petite frame. I'm 5'2 145lbs 38-32-43 my shoulders are 21&#34; across, my arms are 17&#34; long from my armpit to my wrist. Giving it four stars because the inner &#34;sweatshirt zipper is fine, but the actual jacket zipper is finicky as fack.",1
5,I love the color and fit of this shirt and the price was pretty good too!!,1
5,"I bought this to use as part of a mouse costume. Great quality, fluffy and not too thin. Very pleased!",1
5,I decided to go as Gene Simmon's for Halloween last year and didn't want to bother with the eye make-up. These KISS Demon Glasses did the trick. I poked out the lenses and put it on. Voila!,1
3,But runs very small and short,0
5,Perfect fit. Just the right amount of stretch and thickness of the denim.,1
5,"I never imagined that I would buy a dress online and it would be so much better than what u get at the stores. I cant speak enough of the amazing fit! I have a bulging tummy and end up getting questions often asking if am pregnant, but not once in this dress! There is a tight fit at the waist before the dress flares out, so those of u in my situation can be rest assured u wont have to worry about ur tummy in this dress! Great quality and fitting!",1
3,Metal clip on were somewhat uncomfortable to clip on and against your face.,0
1,Stones came out after one wear. Very poorly made. So mad. Smh.,0
1,Save your money these are garbage.  Very thin cheap material. It looks as if a design was plased on plastic. It's strange.,0
5,Love this skirt! It looks very elegant and appears to be a very good quality at such a great price. My only complaint is that I wish I would have gotten a size down. After reading the reviews I assume that there sizing would be too small so I went up a size to medium but it was too large for me (27inch waist). If I would have gotten my normal size it would fit perfectly. Looks like some people may be in denial of their true size.My suggestion is to grab a mesuring tape and measure your true size. The chart will give you your size based off of your numbers. But being that I have an event to go to its no big deal. Nothing a few saftey pins can't fix. Later Il have a seamstress take it in for me.,1
3,I typically purchase a medium in my workout shorts and thought these would be no different.  They are super tight around the waist to the point that they are uncomfortable.  I wouldn't consider them too small.  I just think the location of where the waist falls makes them feel like they do not fit properly.,0
5,Perfect fit. Good quality for school.,1
2,The dress is beautiful and the quality is very good. The sizing was incorrect. It was listed as XL and it looked like a size 10. Five stars for the dress 1 star for sizing.,0
3,"It's cute, and looks just like the pictures, but is very cheaply made and feels like it too",0
1,arrived broken.  returned,0
2,Looks nice but it doesn‚Äôt fit as a swimsuit should be. It is larger than the tabled size.,0
5,"The robs are a great buy for lounging around the house, yet still keeping sexy. The packaging and product quality were good. I now own 4.",1
4,These was nice and look like photo. Worked out for my witch costume.,1
5,Great color and great fit!,1
5,Great quality.,1
1,Turning orange - not silver,0
5,"This cloth cleans better than other jewelry cloths that I have had.  I am also happy with its size.  Very, very pleased with this purchase.",1
4,"I really like this double secure banded headband (which in my mind is what keeps it on my head while I'm running around or working out) The material is super flexible, but enough to stay on my head for activities. Honestly, the only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the tightness when you first wear it. It works into the stretchiness, but I did have a headache for the first few days.<br />So far so good!",1
1,Ripped within the first 20 minutes. Total fail.,0
5,I wish I could find more of these and more colors and patterns. This is the only and best. The only one my children and myself will wear. So comfortable and does not make you feel suffocated or sweaty. It is even easy on the hair. Great product!,1
4,Nice bag but the lining isn't cloth like the older VB bags.,1
5,I purchased 2 remotes and had both of them programmed and in our cars in less that 5 minutes!!  Easy to follow instructions.,1
3,Love the dress but the size is smaller fit than it should be.,0
4,"The gloves fits great, but is not warm below 50F",1
1,"Fit is smaller than expected. Also, I‚Äôd your looking for a breezy dress for the summer, this isn‚Äôt it. The liner and fabric are stifling.",0

5,"Bands appear to be wearable all the time if you want to. The grey band has no color in the print so is harder to see the print - which might work out if you want to wear the band without shouting out you have a pacemaker.<br />8"" band works out good for me (190 lb male that wears medium gloves). Slightly tight getting on and off but stretches a little and is not tight on my wrist.",1

2,"Very thin lightweight material....I couldn't wear it as a skirt but opted to keep it to wear as a swimsuit cover up. A month or so later I finally had the opportunity to wear it and within a few hours I noticed the stitching was coming apart where the waist band (portion with tie ends) was coming apart from the skirt portion. By the time I got home, about 6 inches had come completely undone and I was having to sort of tuck and roll the separated skirt portion under the waist band.",0
5,Gorgeous hat!!! Nice quality.,1
5,Super Great item,1
5,"It's a sturdy reliable watch that I wear when running, jogging, or walking.  Can't mess with a good ol' Casio!",1
5,"I got one pair of these and liked them so much, I bought two more.  The material and stitching are of a better quality than other bike shorts I've bought online.  The side pockets are roomy but without adding bulk.  I like the slightly longer length.  A little more expensive than some other brands, but worth it in my opinion.",1
2,Wasn't happy with the overall look of the bag. Looked cheap. Returned it.,0
4,good product for price,1
5,"I like the material, really nice",1
5,These are great- very comfortable and perfect for dance class!,1
5,Love them they match the jacket perfect,1
4,Color somewhat more salmon than pink.,1
1,"Received my shirts today, the fixed it shirt has a sticky substance all over the inside of it. Not happy at all.",0
5,cute valentines gift,1
2,"I wanted to like this strap, but I really feel uncomfortable wearing it. It looks and feels much cheaper than I expected. And if you have smaller wrists, you'll be left with a lot of excess strap action. The metal loops to retain the excess strap are sewn in place, so there's you are unable to adjust.",0
5,"This scarf is super soft! Beautiful high quality scarf with the cutest little cat detail ü•∫ also the packaging was a 10/10 they even included a little thank-you note and pin. If you‚Äôre looking for a great gift, look no further.",1
1,"The peter pan collar is floppy, the fabric is a gross metallic plastic, and the fit is awful. I've ordered Allegra K before, but apparently their products are not sold by the same people ..<br />I love peter pan collars but don't waste your money on this",0
4,not quite gold enough but still solid,1
1,You get what you pay for. The zipper broke immediately and the card slots swallowed my cards instead of keeping them where they're supposed to be. My 2yr old daughter likes it as a play wallet so at least it didn't just go onto the trash.,0
5,"Extremely comfortable high quality strap, and plenty big for those with larger wrists. I bought the green one for my Hamilton Khaki Field King and it looks and feels just fantastic.",1
1,Very very cheap. I returned it,0
2,The feeling of fabric. Very cheap and a scratchy feeling,0
3,"Bought this for our Nook HD. The case is somewhat a little heavy but the Nook had a little problem sliding into the case. It was very tight, but after some pushing and pulling, it went in. The leather around the nook it self is very sturdy, but for my Wife, she says it's a bit to heavy for her. For the price, it's ok. There are better cases out there.",0
2,These masks are made in China!  It says nothing about where they are manufactured in the description!!  They are wide enough but the vertical height is a little short.  The material is really light and when worn there are gaps around the nose and sides. It provides very little protection from germs!,0
1,This shirt is ridiculously small. It would fit a child.,0
2,This dress is cute but very see through and the back makes it easy for her to pull it down in the front. I'm keeping it because I only wanted it for birthday pictures but I dont forsee her wearing it again except as a dress up dress. It's also about 2 sizes too big. I'm quite disappointed with it.,0
5,These tops are awesome! Fit so great,1
3,Cheaply made but pretty,0
2,I‚Äôm ample in the behind this fits as more if a sweater than a sweater dress. Great quality but I will be returning.,0
5,"For the amount paid, its a great product! It has a quartz movement and comes with a fashionable band! It's antique look, and dependable mechanics make for a great buy!",1
1,To small. I ordered a X large. Chinese sizes are different from American sizes. They wanted me to pay to send back to China. They would not refund me/,0
1,"I purchased to wrap up my hair at night or during the day! The scarf measurement are correct according to description however the photo in the description is not what I ordered. I orders a scarf with bold royal blue trim and this doesn‚Äôt have it, also the scarf on the model has so much more fabric/longer then the true measurements.  Otherwise ok product.",0
1,"This product took 1/2 the summer to arrive.  Does not fit, cheap material and seller will not answer requests to return.  Unable to reach Amazon to assist with return.  Stay away from this product!",0
5,great look for the price I bought 2 for gifts will buy more,1
1,Very cheap top that is so stiff and unflattering when put on. Save your money and pass on this one.,0
3,"Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,",0
3,"Almost kind of wished I would have paid a little more attention to detail. The picture makes them look a little longer, thicker and made out of better material.  Definitely not!",0
3,"The dress fits well, but the color is off. We ordered an ivory but it is white. Trying to contact the seller regarding this is impossible, so I am having to just return it. I may try reordering in champange and hopefully it will be more of what I am looking for.",0
1,Buy a real belt that can't open at the touch of feather.,0
2,"Does not fit how it should. The top is too tight, it goes on but too snug to wear",0
3,Way too small.,0
3,"No se ve de mala calidad, pero queda muy corto y si elijo un size m√°s grande le quedar√° muy grande.",0
5,All four pairs of pants are comfortable and a good fit.,1
2,This shirt runs super small!,0
5,Nice,1
5,"Worked great for me as a breastfeeding mom. I wore it to a wedding reception and it was comfy and allowed me to nurse easily. A little thin, but can't really complain at this price",1
1,"I wore them 3 times and sold them at a garage sale, because they hurt too much. I tried using stick-on cushioning for the heel, but they still rubbed near my toes. I do not recommend.",0
5,I added this to the zipper pull on a small sport bag - perfect!!!,1
5,I like it,1
3,Awkward fit,0
1,Product isn‚Äôt thick at all wayyyy too small doesn‚Äôt even fit my 2 year olds head,0
5,street cred,1
1,I wear a size 26/28 so I figured a 5x would be big enough. I ordered the green and white but what I got was blue and pink. The dress size was more like a 1x. I was very disappointed. Just make sure you know when ordering the clothes they're sizes are in Asian.,0
4,"It is a lot darker blue than pictured. It‚Äôs almost a light navy. Was disappointed. But function-wise,  it was great! Lots of pockets",1
2,"Cute look, very soft, but the string is garbage and will not stand up to toddler use. Baby tugged it a bit, then walked around the house dragging the mitten for a couple minutes, and the string split then immediately both ends frayed all the way up. She hadn't even worn, this all happened in minutes. If you just want cute mittens, these seem good. If you want them on a string to prevent loss since kids don't keep their mittens on, don't buy these.",0
3,"I'm not gonna lie to you guys. I bought a mens hoodie because I am always stealing mens hoodies from men and I tried to be responsible and just buy my own. It fits weird. Probably not weird if you're a tall skinny guy; Itd fit you perfectly. But it's very long. The bottom of the hoodie is tight and clings to you, so it looks weird if you're not pulling it down all the time. Which is a look you might want. But for me, I wasnt a fan.<br /><br />I don't know where you men buy your stealable hoodies. The search continues.",0
3,"Decent necklace for the price. I hate that the initial is tilted to the side, but that is my fault for not double checking the picture.",0
2,Opal was not same color as advertised .  Was not blue at all . Was crystal opal instead .. didn't have that nice deep blue coloring.,0
1,Nice print.  Delivery delayed .,0
3,"As noted before by a few - this is fairly short. I think I should have gotten a medium not a small as I did. The sleeves are long - which is fine - but I actually hate the thumb holes in this I didn‚Äôt know they would be there, I usually love thumb holes.",0
1,"It's the size of a penny, maybe.",0
2,i usually wear a large to xl in juniors shirts. i wear a 36d bra and this top buttons together all the way!! its good quality waffle knit like long johns. cute fit.,0
5,"I love these sneakers for work instead of shoes, very comfortable and they look good with khakis.",1
5,These were perfect for our Dinosaur Birthday party! The kids had a blast decorating these.,1
5,"The pendant is really quite beautiful.  The stone is a little larger than my 14 year old wanted, so I kept it for myself :-)",1
2,Sleeves aren‚Äôt as puffy. The sleeves are a flimsy material and do not puff very much at all. There is no ruching which adds to the fullness of the sleeves... worth 19.99 but definitely not as cute as the version that‚Äôs circulating on IG with the full sleeves. I‚Äôm returning!<br /><br />Runs true to size-very stretch.,0
4,It fits great and it looks just like the picture. Just the only complaint is that it flaired out at the pockets and that made me look bigger than I really am. It is NOT too short either! Hits about knee length (I'm 5'5) and it really was made nicely. I'd give 5 stars if it wasn't for the pockets making me look fatter and I wanted to look slimmer I thought this cut would have done that for me. Not the case. I did return it and didn't wear it to the occasion I planned on.,1
5,"Very high quality product.  Not afraid of it accidentally decoupling at all, or wearing down over time.  Even though it's a bit pricey, it works great!  Quality worth the extra cost.",1
5,"Bought this dress for my daughter's wedding.  It was beautiful, true to size, and great material.",1
5,"Perfect statement piece durable ,has shape, rhinestones haven't fallen off after a few wears. Get lots of compliments",1
3,"Product is okay.  However, unlike the picture, the sunglasses did not come with the hinge joint that allows it to snap open or close.  It came with a much more flimsy joint.  I'm disappointed by that because the last time I ordered this it had the hinge joint",0
5,"Super cute, true to size, they get a little loose after being worn every day but they're a true rose gold and match with all my daughters outfits.. Very comfy her fave so far. We also have these in beige and I have them for myself in beige n olive green & love em",1
5,It was what I wanted,1
1,"Wow.  They only lasted two months before they both broke - the loop came apart on both legs yesterday while my husband was at work.  He sat here sewing them back together, which he shouldn't have to do after only two months.  I guess you get what you pay for, so now I'm on a quest to find more expensive ones which are hopefully constructed better.",0
5,"Inlove this dress so much! From what the reviews said, I ordered one size up. Normally a small, 5'3&#34; 116 lbs. very flattering!",1
2,"These are cheap, mass produced earrings. The label on this pair stated &#34;made in china&#34; and the label on the second paid stated &#34;made in USA.&#34; Disappointed, as these were to be gifts for my nieces.",0
4,I wear a 7 & 7/8 hat and these caps still fit great.. looks & feels good üëç,1
2,"Works well, but straps don‚Äôt hold tight and loosen quickly which causes my socks to slip down. They stay up enough so that no adjustment is needed throughout the day, but I expected the to hold higher and tighter. I will likely add a safety pin or other fastener to hold them up.",0
1,What I didn‚Äôt like is that they never heated up my feet,0
5,I have purchased at least five or six other types of masks during the pandemic and this is the first one that fits me perfectly and breathes well. I have a big head and this fits me with lots of room for adjustment.,1
1,Loved the shirt but the blue fabric ripped under the arm and can't be sewn. Totally bummed.,0
3,Too small and tight.,0
5,"I ordered this for my boyfriend, he likes it...it fits him well!!<br />Thank you!!",1
1,To big.,0
3,"Mala calidad de la tela,el art√≠culo no se parece a lo mostrado ni en el color",0
4,Very comfortable and stay up. Only thing Grey ones are a little see through. Have to wear same color underwear. Top stays up but the legs roll up a little when sit down and pocket for cell phone could be bigger. Does not hold newer large cell phones well.,1
3,Did not like the material,0
3,I loved how this shirt looked online. When I opened it I was sad to see that not only was the shirt itself made kind of boxy and odd in shape but the flower was like a cheap iron on. It had no give to it whatsoever. I returned it.,0
5,The earrings are lively and if a nice quality. The stones look very much like mined stones with delicate  black lacey lines.  The wires have finished ends and are easy to put in and take off.  The earrings look like high quality turquoise--at a great price.,1
4,"ordered 3x and it was way too small for us sizes, however, I returned it with no problem and reordered in a 5x that fit like a 3x and I love it. it is breathable material and the colors are bright",1
5,The quality is quite lovely for the price and variety you get in the package.,1
2,These are panty hose type of thin.,0
1,Muy muy mala calidad.. en cuanto mi hija se lonprobo se desgarro la costura... muy costos.. pero no sirve .. no lo compres.. te arrepentiras,0
2,the product was not as detailed in the picture but it is okey,0
5,My daughter loved her cozy socks and said her feet were warm. The socks are nice and soft and the cushion really helped when wearing her rubber boots. Will purchase more pairs!,1
3,"I received this today. The box looked nice, and when I took off the shrink wrap and opened it, it was down hill from there. First of all, that mesh band is only on the TOP of the watch. The underside of the watch is metal links. I have never seen this in my life!  The watch is advertised to ""fit a wrist up to 8 inches"" and it BARELY fit my 7 inch wrist, that was with some squeezing.  And believe me, I checked the box for extra links. None. Third, this was, in the box and sealed with shrink wrap for who knows how long, was already running, which makes me think that in a few months this battery is going to die and I'm going to be looking for another watch, since it is almost impossible right now to get watch batteries replaced and it would cost more than this watch.  I deliberately chose to get this watch because it comes on Prime so I know it's not being shipped from China.  If this watch were getting a grade, I'd give it a C-",0
1,"Product fits like a large. Im typically a 1-2X depending on the brand, i purchased a 3x because i wanted it to be comfy for sleeping and it fit snug like a large. It was poor quality, lots of loose stands of the material, and the buttons were loose",0
1,"These are lovely but I wore them once and as I removed them at the end of the day one of the earrings broke leaving the post<br /> in my ear. I am very disappointed, I bought these to match the brooch I had purchased a few weeks earlier.",0
5,Love the Nonna bracelet..I added individual charms with my grandkids pictures on each along with silver spacers...looks beautiful!,1
1,Not comfortable at edges where very rough.,0
2,I bought this in a xl and doesn‚Äôt fit. It looks like a medium not even a large.,0
1,The material si not what i espect,0
1,It was to big and I totally did not like the style when it was delivered. It was not what I expected at all. I would not recommend it or reorder this style at all. Totally disappointed,0
5,"I bought these to wear in our dog kennel and for walking them in the mud, rain, grass around our property.  They are fantastic!  Great value, true to size , comfy and worked great all summer!",1
1,This skirt was nothing like the picture. The elastic was all messed up. The pattern on the sides didn‚Äôt meet up nicely.  Looked horrible.<br />Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone!<br />Also I got a L it fit like a XXL,0
3,"I really wanted to love this dress but had the same problem with it as I have with most fitted dresses. Simply put they are not made for anyone with a true hourglass shape. Chest 34, waist 24 hips 36, height 5'7"" weight 140.  The fit was great in the chest, hips and thighs and I really liked the cut and color. Sadly the waist had too much extra material, I could have fit and additional 5 pounds in there with me. Sadly am returning them, but not for any fault of the dress or seller.",0
3,Not a bad shirt but fits very big l,0
4,"I like the flowy nature of the dress. I like how it fits a bit loose on me. The material is a bit cheap/thin, but you get what you paid for.",1
1,Lasted about one week before they started falling apart. The color faded instantly and they fit too large i'm a slim man this is for someone bigger. I would steer clear.,0
4,"It looks and feels well made and sturdy for very wet days. From the picture, it looked like the outside had a pretty sheen, like parachute cloth, but it's polyurethane--looks like a dull plastic finish. I got the green, but the royal might be prettier. The lining is 100% polyester, a very thin mesh for all temperatures. Someone said it's made to resist tears, and I hope that's true. The problem I've had with these items before is that they tear easily. But I think this one is made for the professional outdoors person--I hope.",1
3,"Worked for the costume, actually fits pretty well.",0
2,The earrings themselves are really cute but really uncomfortable to wear.,0
1,"This was the worst piece of clothing I've ever bought. The fabric is weird and has no give, the cut is weird and didn't fit right on me (a girl) nor my SO (a boy). The worst part is that it says &#34;I'm a cat,&#34; but it has floppy dog ears.",0
5,Good goggles - good price,1
2,These are funny however the mask is too small. I‚Äôm average sized and it barely covers my face and puckers on the side,0
5,I love these gloves!  I use them to drive in the mornings when it‚Äôs cold.,1
2,"I liked the leather, but it's too wide by the connection to the tracker, it's just about as wide as the pin itself. I'm returning this. It gets 2 stars for how nice it feels, but it's useless since I can't get it into the tracker enough to secure the pin.",0
3,"Very pretty when you first wear it, but dirt accumulates on it quickly.  Also, the material of the band is kind of irritating to the skin.  I like to sleep with my Fitbit on to track my sleep pattern, but because this band made my skin kind of itchy and sweaty, I could not keep it on for a long period of time.",0
2,"I bought this product as a gift for my mom. After only having it for 2 days and wearing it once, it ripped. I ordered a replacement, same size an XL and she was sent a small in the XL box. Although she said it was comfortable the one time she worn it, I‚Äôm highly disappointed that the replacement was the wrong size.",0
5,These are very light and I haven't had a headache since I started using them. I will definitely be ordering more.,1
5,Liked the whole thing:),1
5,"Look and feel really good..nice fit, sturdy..and not stiff so no fear of cracking as it breaks in",1
2,"I bought these specifically for running and I didn't even have to try them on to realize they aren't going to work. Right away when taking them out of the package I was like ""yeah no, not gonna do it, not even close"". They are much thicker and heavier than I thought. They don't even feel like a polyester blend, they feel like cotton to me and the waist band is wide and thick. I'm a serious runner and there's no way I could go a few miles in these. I don't even like them for working out or other sports, they are just too thick and heavy. I mean it feels like a quality product but not really for exercising which seems to be what they are marketed for. I could see some good yardwork getting done in these if that's what you wanted, otherwise I'd buy some real dry-fit active wear.",0
1,This product should get 0 stars bc it does NOT match what's online: red shirt with black trim was chosen. I am so disappointed. My husband will not be able to wear red in our family pictures tomorrow.  I received a polyester see through red shirt with a tan trim.,0
4,"See above.  I like the fit and style of this jacket-sweater.  One thing that caused temporary anxiety:  I ordered a medium, as last time.  This item was labeled small, but when I put it on, it is exactly the same size as the earlier maroon garment, which was correctly labeled medium.",1
5,My daughter LOVES this- and it's not too short in front (I don't like the ones that are mini skirts in front- this hits just above the knee just right),1
2,"Cute dress but I looked like a fat cow. The material seemed fine but the dress was too short and showed my fat legs, the dress doesn't hide fat belly either. I am fairly tall but the dress looked awful on me, the dress was too small, too short and made me look fat. I returned the dress. It was a real bummer!",0
2,The 5t seriously looks like it's for a 1 year old,0
5,"The cord is slightly annoying but not nearly enough to stop me from wearing it, and I wear it everyday regardless if I'm going out or staying in. While it has no religious significance to me personally, the words alone have helped me keep my grip on rougher days.",1
3,"These were thicker than I expected them to be. They bunch up occassionally in my daughter's brace. Otherwise, I think they do the job, but I may try another brand next.",0
5,These are a perfect gift for my 2 daughter in laws. I will be giving them these at Christmas time.,1
3,The ears and bow are nice. Headband is flimsy.,0
1,That bracelet too small I returned I don‚Äôt see they pay me back?,0
5,Very satisfied.  Much more durable then expected for the price!,1
5,"I always sleep through my alarms, I never heard them, even when I had them set on the loudest alarm sound. I got this product in hopes that it would be the thing that woke me up, and it does. I tended to snooze my Pavlok shock clock, without intending to do so. I found that setting it to the QR Scanner is the setting that works best for me because it does not allow me to snooze it.",1
5,Quality was shockingly good. Pieces fit well and colors were as described. Great product,1
5,My nice was super excited!,1
5,"These tights are very comfortable and stretchy.  They are also durable, I have worn them and washed them at least ten times and they still look new.  They also fit as expected.",1
5,"The supplier kindly sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinions expressed here are entirely my own<br /><br />This is a really sexy and slimming design dress. The big bonus for me is that it can be easily cut by hand to the length you need it to be. This is a first for me as usually I need to take my maxi dresses to the tailor to be altered. I am 5.2&#34; and this dress is very long on me. There is a lining inside that is firm and stretchy and covers all the main &#34;bits&#34; you need covering. The lace overlay part of the dress is soft, stretchy and wrinkle free. This means you can alter the dress to the exact length you want without sewing.<br /><br />The top part of the dress has a cut out bust area that covers as well as emphasises the bust area and that part is padded. I unpicked the stitcing in the seams and removed the padding, they do not have a hole that makes the pads easily removable. It is tastefully designed and the modest lace parts add to the charm of this dress. I will wear this with a short lace cardigan but you could easily wear it as is.<br /><br />The waist band area is great for holding in your waist and making the shape of the dress more feminine. There is a short zip at the back. The back is also partly open making it more flexible to get on and off and there is a small gold button at the top for closing.<br /><br />I received this dress in a size XXL and I take a UK18/20 (generous stretch in the fabric) It fits me. I have washed it in the machine with other darks and it washes well. I didn't iron it or tumble dry it either.<br /><br />The stitching and materials used are all really great.<br /><br />I have added photographs.",1
3,Fits as advertised.  Okay-ish screen print,0
5,"Helmet lined adds cushioning to top of head where helmet liner is wearing down. (Replacement liner not available, so this product should extend the life of an expensive motorcycle helmet.)",1
5,"Holds up well , fits nice n snug.<br />I orderd 34dd. It fit as expected .",1
5,It fits perfect and it's beautiful!,1
3,The writing is so small it's hard to read,0
5,"I wear compression socks every day, and it is nice to find a dressier style to wear with skorts and slacks.  These socks are priced appropriately, and I would love to see more designs by NurseMates.",1
5,Exactly perfect for what I need them for . Keeps my hands warm and leaves my fingers free,1
5,Great fit and quality,1
3,They were fantastic.,0
5,Leggings are a good material and the nonslip really helps with my baby learning to walk.,1
5,"I love Twiztid, and I love the necklace! Whoop whoop!",1
1,"I'd really love to give this product 5 stars, but just can't.  The capris themselves are gorgeous, the fabric is soft and light and I think these would be the best capris I've ever owned IF...THEY WOULD SEND ME THE RIGHT SIZE!!!  I've ordered these pants 3 times now in medium and have recieved the wrong size EVERY TIME!!!  So I honestly have no way of knowing if they are true to size or if the material holds up, because I haven't actually been able to wear a pair longer than to just try them on the first time.",0
4,"This case is awesome to throw in your bag and take on trips.  It keeps everything sorted, and prevents tangles.  The only reason it got a 4 and not a 5 is due to the necklace side being a little small if you have larger necklaces (with multiple stones, etc).  You could still take along a few favorites!",1
2,"Keeps demagnetizing my house card, If you live in a appartment or house with a key card I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product.",0
4,Very nice and fast delivery. Great,1
2,Heat up great!  but get holes easily.  They have lasted me 1 winter so far.,0
5,"I like the necklaces. However, the packaging that it came in made it very easy for the necklaces to break or even get tangled it knots. I did take my time undoing them but there has to be an easier way to ship them.",1
1,My son is 6 and he and he wanted a watch for Christmas. I returned the watch because it was way too Big. The watch is man size not like boy size. Maybe ok for older teenager but not a youngster.,0
5,Nice fair priced compression socks.,1
3,These are baby size and I don't know too many baby's with piercings. So unless your a toddler and have a desire to get fangs then this items for you. But if your a adult or even a teen these are way to small.,0
1,"Not protective enough, lots of gaps in the sides.",0
3,Looks nice but it is not curved at all. It‚Äôs extremely straight so it looks kind of funny. I was hoping to wear it for an Audrey Hepburn costume but I don‚Äôt think I will be keeping it:/ Does come in a cute box though,0
4,Kids love playing with these and you can get them at a GREAT price here on amazon.  Way cheaper than your local department/toy store.  Bright lights and most last a really long time.  Obsessionally you might get one that is dim or doesn't last long.....but well worth the bundled price.,1
5,Very nice quality.,1
3,I THEY WERE CUTE BUT I THINK I LOST THEM WHEN I MOVED,0
5,Okay for the money but they need to be re adjusted if you heat them up you can re curl them if needed. Shipped fast and okay,1
4,The lever is hard to get through the belt material to fasten.,1
5,Just like the picture,1
5,"Fit well nice and lightweight, love them very much.",1
2,"I wanted to love these and the customer service was great, but these did nothing but fall down all day in size small. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 136lbs so I thought maybe I needed to size down and that was the problem. Customer service was great and sent me a  size xs at no charge. Unfortunately, the size xs was cutting into me. Ultimately, I went to Athleta and spent the money for some quality tights and I love them.",0
1,"Junk, flake and peel when they get wet. Dont waste your money",0
3,"okay, this purse is beautiful inside and out, just as described. however. if you carry a lot in it and leave it hanging on a door handle at night like i did, the handles will start to tear. it already has torn in 3 places with everyday use and i have had it 3 months only :(",0
5,"I LOVE this shirt!  I got one in pink (I know there is another name for pink) and love the fit, the feel, the look - all of it.  You cannot go wrong with Soul Trotters and all their products.  Well-made, great quality and great price.",1
5,"Love, love, LOVE this bag, would absolutely buy again or a second in another color. It's very well made, the lining is very substantial and the zippers are A+. The size in the photo is accurate, and it isn't too stiff. For the price this is honestly the only way to go for a simple, stylish handbag that actually comes in tasteful colors.<br /><br />Caveat: unless you are super skinny the regular handles won't fit over your shoulder.",1
5,These leggings were the exact material I was looking for! I love the feeling of these leggings. I hate the cotton type leggings and these aren‚Äôt shiny nylon and spandex. I‚Äôm a bit short (5‚Äô1) with a booty and these fit the length of my legs and I got a medium. They are definitely squat proof!,1
5,"Beautiful chain! Returned because diameter was too small for my husbands pendent. Otherwise, was very nice!",1
1,"This dress is made from a very cheap, clingy fabric. The picture makes it look like it has movement past the hips, but it fit more like a mermaid flared dress at the bottom. Don't bother ordering this dress unless you are going for a street-walker vibe.",0
4,"I love because you can make odd patterns with the item. Even though i live in Arizona, its pretty hot to wear in public. But i cant find anything to hate about it but the under part is sorta itchy, and uncomfortable. So i would wear a sleeve for comfort",1
5,"One of the best clothing lines out right now, extremely comfortable and feels so good.",1
5,I purchased this for my father in law. The product looks good. It‚Äôs very soft. It feels so comfortable. I can‚Äôt wait for the winter to have my father in law try it on. My father in law always feels the need of a vest in winter and this is even better !,1
5,I am in love with this sweater! Fits well with a nice amount of roominess. Bright white color. I bought an XL and then a L because it went on sale.,1
1,I ordered the size XXL and received a size small. My stepdad is 6‚Äô5‚Äù and 300lbs. This wouldn‚Äôt even cover his stomach. I‚Äôm very disappointed.,0
4,"Warning- do not buy this skirt if expecting a looser  a-line fit unless you are a size 0. My size can vary from 4 to 8- I ordered a 10 and if is pretty snug. The fit is hip hugging. The skirt, however, is actually very cute, despite it not being what I expected. My advice is to size up and look at product pictures before ordering. Otherwise, really cute and a great steal!",1
1,The cloth really is something terrible..,0
5,Awesome product,1
1,"Did not fit my glasses, but they fit my wife's glasses.  I even measured before ordering. These were supposed to be the largest size.",0
5,Love them and wear them to work. Tunnels were outlawed as I became the first person at my place of work to have gauges.,1
5,Purchase this product for my granddaughters cat in the hat day ! Quality is very nice many layers if you look at other ones that are thinner you will know the difference color was perfect now my granddaughter can use it for play dress as well!,1
3,Too small but good quality,0
2,"Love the style however the quality is not there.  Was simple to size and comfortable to wear. But after a week and a half, the pins started dropping out of the the links and coming apart. Was affairs it would drop off and be damaged from being dropped or falling into a dangerous location. Also lost multiple,e pins so no longer can put it back together<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't start wearing it right away and now it is outside the return window so I can't return it. :(",0
5,"Very pretty, nice scarf. Wife likes it. Fantastic price. Shopped and received faster than expected.",1
1,I got this outfit for my grand daughter‚Äôs end of the school year celebration...I was very disappointed in the quality of the manufacturer and quality of the material and it was not true to size ‚òπÔ∏è,0
4,"The seaming on this top is very flattering as is the scoop neckline. The neck is low cut enough to show off a statement necklace but not so deep you have to constantly adjust your bra. The lace inserts are a nice timeless touch that dress the top up enough for work.  You definitely want to match your bra when you wear this as the straps will be slightly visible through the shoulder lace. I've worn it out dancing and I've worn it to the office with a jacket. Red is one of my favorite colors and this top is a nice tomato red with yellow undertones. Glad I bought this piece, its at home wherever I wear it.",1
1,They're super cute but the quality is poor. 1 of the 4 pairs was completely thread bare by the toe section of the sock. That pair didn't survive one machine washing - despite a super gentle cycle.,0
1,the material was very cheap and low quality,0
4,Boots are good quality and fit as expected.,1
2,For less than $8 for set of 2 I should have expected these hen saddles to be poor quality. Sewing is not good. Size is a bit on the small size for standard size chickens. Wing bands have no stretch so will be uncomfortable and could cause chafing. I think I'm going to send them back for a refund so I can buy better saddles for my 2 Wyandotte hens.,0
3,"Short, returned",0
5,Love my belt. The only thing I wish is the company would offer different sizes it is very long on my size 4 waist. I put it through my belt loops to hold it down.,1
3,"Nice looking watch, but very light and flimsy. Not as heavy as it looks. Keeps good time so far, but only time will tell (pun intended). Gives instructions on how to set date, yet there is NO date function on the watch. I give it 6 months, TOPS, before it winds (pun intended) in the trash can. Flashy, but trashy!",0
2,"This was way to big, and I got the smallest available. But, the colors were very cute.",0
5,Great fabric and easy care dress. Love it!!!,1
4,"Nice length, fit's nicely, the texture is a bit hard. otherwise highly recommended.",1
5,"Mom loves this little card organizer. She has a bunch of credit, rewards, and insurance cards she likes to throw in the bottom of her bag. Now she keeps them in this little guy, and checkout is so much faster! And she doesn't have to dump out her purse out to make a payment. It's very cute.",1
1,"This dress is just all wrong. I am 5'6"" and the pockets are above the waist! It makes the dress stick out at the hips. It's so weird and awkward! Nope. Not going to bother with a return.  Just taking it to Goodwill.",0
3,"I love the style of these - lace socks are often my favorite because they are very cooling to wear. There is a rubber seal all around the side of the sock and it sticks to your skin so it shouldn't move. But it does move, these roll off my heel constantly which may be because they are a little on the small side (I wear size 8). The rubber seal is extremely warm after wearing these for a few hours. So they're all right but definitely not the best quality.",0
5,"Thought these might slip off while walking.  Nope. They have heel grips that actually work, unlike some adult socks.  Perfect!",1
5,I love the colors on these earrings.  They were fast shipping.,1
1,Very bad quality,0
3,Very snug fit. Not as expected in size and the color is not as vibrant,0
5,I love the bright colors. They fit great for my ears no discomfort. The jellyfish as able to be seen. Over all great looking,1
5,"Gotten these for my grandson! He loves them,  good quality socks. They wash up good wasn't any shrinking....cute design! Would buy again üòä",1
2,Elastic top is like a large thick rubber band. Not going to return it I might have it fixed,0
2,The studs are much larger than you'd think. So if you want a large stud. This is for you!,0
5,"This T-shirt was a perfect fit and is very comfortable.  I like the shade of pink, neither too pale nor too bright. The fabric is thinner than I expected, a little thinner than a typical ‚Äúunisex‚Äù T-shirt would be.  I‚Äôm satisfied with it.",1
4,"Great luggage set. I received all 3 pieces in great condition. The lock on the side worked well. I ended up returning it because the color white in the photo is not accurate to the picture. To be fair, they did describe it as &#34;Ivory white&#34; it is more of a creamy beige color. I think I may reorder the set in black once it's back in stock.",1
2,Broke trying to get out of the packaging.,0
5,bought to wear under some shorter casual dresses in the summer. Perfect for that purpose. I will be buying others in other colors.,1
1,No me gusto,0
4,Nice looking watch but the strap seems delicate for a waterproof watch.  But I like it very much and hope it stands up to the rougher treatment of water.  Stylish.,1
1,"Had to discard, wouldn‚Äôt snap shut",0
5,"Beautiful dress, I wore it to a wedding.",1
1,Why do you have to make the dresses to show almost all your boobs there‚Äôs no reason we need to have those hanging out everywhere.,0
3,These are for kids,0
3,"I like these sunglasses, although they can be big at times. Not sure if my head is stretching them out or what! I have to bend them slightly to make them fit, i snapped my last pair in half by doing that (totally my fault). I wish they were a bit smaller, but they are cute and get the job done!",0
3,I REALLY love the look of these and I want to give 5 stars however the backs are poorly made and the ratings fell off several times due to the backing jus slipping off the post.,0
5,"I was looking for something simple, with enough tread to maintain grip on some wet rocks and mud, and these have held up great! Just what I was looking for.",1
5,"I'm very happy with this nightgown. It fits just as expected, is nice and soft, and the bottom edge is pretty with its specific cut, which is kind of like a ""handkerchief dress"".",1
5,Nice fix color perfect.,1
3,These earrings are really pretty but of course are missing stones. Not 1 but 4! I‚Äôm not going to bother sending them back but I am really bummed.  Not sure how they made it thru quality control.,0
5,"Love it. I also had a broken strap with this purse and it was replaced extremely quickly by the seller. Super fantastic value and customer service that will keep me coming back.<br /><br />Update: I came across this review while looking up the brand so that I could purchase another bag from them, and thought I would update this review. I can't believe it's been almost a year since I bought this purse, and frankly if you saw it neither would you. That is saying something for me, as I am a ram, slam and jam kinda gal with my handbags. I do not baby my purses or switch them out. My purses work, and have hard lives. I'm seeking a new one just for a style switch, but this one has held up well enough, that I'll probably keep it around for later days.<br /><br />Keep doing what you're Scarleton. I've told so many people about your brand. Solidly done.",1
3,"I sometimes have trouble getting my ring off for the gym as my knuckles swell easily,  and was really hoping this would work when i am doing a WOD vs straight lifting where I can wear gloves. I sized up to a large based on my small fingers (size 5) and the carat size (2) as suggestec and i could barely get it over my knuckle and the ring. Once it was on, it was a little too big where the ring actually sits so it slid around and exposed the band a little.  I was only rowing that day so I dealt with it,  but would never wear this for any barbell, dumbbell or rig work. Really wanted this to work for me,  guess its just not right for my fingers.  I also don't think it is intended for any stones i would say over 1 carat.",0
1,I am 6ft and it is really short on me. I returned it..,0
4,Small,1
3,"So I got these pants for the sole purpose in wearing them around the house/running errands. I'm 5'7, 160lbs and got a medium and the fit is perfect. I also got the &#34;rose bouquet champagne blush&#34; and definitely NOT what the picture displayed it as. From my take I though the pants were purple with the rose splayed all over, but in fact it's more like a navy. (Meh). It's not terrible, but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />Also, the big question you may ask is are they see through or not? Well the lining in my pants were white & at first I didn't think so, but when I bent over they totally were!! I could see the butt designs on my underwear, so I guess if you're using these as workout gear I might look elsewhere. If you're wearing nude undies or maybe thongs or even going commando they may be fine to wear. I am in the end keeping these because you really can't see though them otherwise. They are very flattering & like many mentioned SUPER COMFY! They have a satiny feel & they don't give away every line or wrinkle in your legs. Also, the fabric is light, but not paper thin like I find in other brands.<br /><br />For the price, honestly it's about right. I live in activewear and was shocked at how much this cost (kinda cheap). Now does that explain why you can see some goods in a bent over position .. probably so. So that's why I gave it 3 stars.",0
5,"I've been wearing these for 9 days so far...and I love them!  I have plantar fasciitis in my right foot and at first the right shoe felt like a little uncomfortable...as if it was putting pressure on a spot that it shouldn't.  Withing just a couple days that sensation went away...and the pain started to go away too.  Now I'm not saying these have ""cured"" me, but there have been days that I've had nearly zero discomfort...and that hasn't happened in months and months.  They are comfortable, seem well built, and most importantly are helping with my plantar fasciitis.  I'm pleased!",1
4,"Got package on time, and it fit my 12 year very well she loved it!! Just didn't receive the Keychain that was mentioned was included but no biggie",1
4,Liked the top however it did not have pockets as shown.,1
2,The color and material were not what I expected. Its rather cheaply made  and small in the arms.,0
4,"Son ordered this on his own and he said ""yeah man I love my Motley Crue hoodie"".<br /><br />I was skeptical because it's inexpensive and clothes like this can be iffy ordered online. You never actually know what you're getting.<br /><br />Fits well. Inside is soft and sweatshirt is over all comfortable. Not overly bulky fabric. Washed well, though I do air dry it to avoid any shrinking at all. Wished the colors on the graphic were a little brighter, but can't be mad.",1
1,Very flimsy and some of the rose gold is already chipping off - I will be returning them.,0
1,I wanted to love this bathing suit but the sizing is not true to size. I ordered a Medium and the top was cute but the bottom was absolutely dreadful. The rouched fabric looked terrible and bulky and it was HUGE on me and I am bottom heavy. Just received it and already initiated a rerurn.,0
5,Well made medium thickness fabric. Fabric is soft and comfortable.,1
5,I love it!,1
5,Excelente. Muy bueno,1
3,I was so excited to get this but then was a little sad that it only had 107 beads and not the 108 beads. I was planning to use this for meditation. It is very pretty I am just missing a bead.,0
3,They are a lil tight XL would have been better fit,0
2,Ordered for my husband for a vegas trip. We ended up not using it because it smelled and it fell apart and we couldn't put it back together. Maybe good for a prop but not as a mask.,0
1,"These earrings are beautiful-- yet they KILLED my sensitive ears.  If you do not have sensitive ears than these are great, but I have to give 1 star since they are unwearable by me due to sensitivity issues. I usually can wear sterling silver with NO PROBLEMS, so it is odd that these gave me issues...just beware if you have sensitive ears.",0
4,I love them..great purchase üòÅ,1
5,Easy to read,1
5,Beautiful and arrived on time.  Love it,1
1,"I sent this back, it was very short and very full which swallowed me up.  I wasn‚Äôt flattering on me.",0
5,Nice adds to my goth look,1
2,"This tail was just what I wanted for an 8 year old's cat Halloween costume.  It fits great, stays put, and you can bend the tail however you would like.  Would have given it 5 stars except it looks like the one i received may have had the tip cut off, and now white fluff is hanging out.  It will be easier to fix than to return, just annoying as I paid for brand new.  2 stars.",0
5,"I love this shirt! On me, it fits just like the photo. I went a size up but I love loose-fitting clothing!",1
3,The glasses are sturdy but the glasses are too small and it makes your eyes look bigger than they should actually appear.,0
5,Great gear,1
2,"If you can make your own, do it. I tried to put it on and I cut my nose because the edges are so sharp. I will need to sand it down to make it smooth and add detail to the mask.",0
5,Loved the details and how small it was. Looks like Arima and is a great price. Plus it shipped right on time! Would love to buy more keychains from Aoshima.,1
4,Fits good although the neck part is pretty high and a little snug. Otherwise both the shirts we purchased in red and blue are very nice.,1
5,"5 stars for value! Only $15.99 and the quality was beyond what I was expecting... quality of the material and way that it drapes is very flattering.  Bust fits nicely which was a surprise, 34 DDD makes it difficult with these types of wrap top dresses. There is no elastic in the back like a lot of the cheaper dresses have, this dress has a zipper which adds some support to the top. 5‚Äô 8 135 lbs ordered a medium. Fit was great! I could stand to have it a little shorter but overall no complaints.",1
5,Her feet went to the side at first but now they fit better. She loves how warm they are,1
5,Me encant√≥  y el materia muy bueno ..Gracias amazon,1
5,This product came as described with no missing pieces.  Fits our 5 year old PreK students perfect.,1
5,"Size large.I'm 5ft,130# 36c-33-41.fits well,about 2&#34; below knees,not see thru.",1
5,My 8 yr old son uses this for his sparing gear. It‚Äôs very strong and spacious. It‚Äôs easy for him to carry and get things in and out of. It would easily work for an adult with sparing gear or a few days worth of clothes. Very glad we got this bag for him.,1
5,"When you buy the expensive 20 dollar bracelets, you do get the perfectly made ones. These are not as top quality bracelets, however the colors are beautiful and some of them look just as nice as the expensive ones! You definitely get your money's worth as there are 12 of them to choose from!",1
5,Great quality! Looked so nice on my handsome son. Thanks!,1
2,"fit is ok, and i like it, but it snags SUPER EASY....ugh",0
4,The skirt is great for tennis and golf because the pocket that is upside down is to hold a golf ball or tennis ball while you are playing.,1
2,Very thin material. No dimension like the picture suggests.,0
5,The necklace was perfect and very good quality. I just bought another one for a friend I loved it so much!,1
5,Love it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 & 150lbs and a D. This product did well even in hot weather!,1
2,Smelled terrible even after a few washes. I emailed the seller and they gave a partial refund. Overall a cute hat but I couldn't get past the stench.,0
2,"I like the appearance of the cap but not how it wears. I prefer a cap that is more firm/stiff that holds it shape better. The material feels on the light side, not firm/strong enough to hold its shape without having my head shoved up into it. in order to get a good round shape/appearance I have to force the cap all the way down snugly onto my head. If I don't do that, it sinks in the middle; not a good look.",0
5,"These rely help keep your arms cool, mainly protection from the sun,they are plenty long and fit great.",1
5,"I have another (many year older) pair of SmartWool cycling socks that I've finally worn thin, so I figured I'd try another.  These are good socks, and I have no bunching in the toes, no issues with seams, etc.  They work well with my somewhat-too-small road shoes, and feel just right in my newer shoes.  I'll probably pick up a couple more pairs after I test them for a few hundred more miles.",1
5,"Very pretty, fits as expected. Great price.",1
2,"Stopped working within a week. Will not charge or turn on. I have a similar product that is a head band so I was excited for the beanie version for winter. Have not returned since it was only 12 bucks, not worth the trip to ship it back. If I decide to replace it and it works I will change my review. I could have just got a dud.",0
5,Love this skirt! Easy wear for summer. Dress up or down. Washes nicely.,1
4,"THE JACKET FITS AS EXPECTED, BUT I HAVE SOME CHUBBY ARMS SO IT IS A LITTLE TIGHT AROUND THE ARMS.",1
1,The Velcro on this band broke down quickly.,0
3,"I thought I would like the adjustable strap, but I found it uncomfortable. Cute, but wouldn't order again.",0
5,"Beautiful,  love it.",1
2,"The material and style was just what I was looking for, but the seams came undone almost immediately during the first hour of wear. That was disappointing, I wanted to love them.",0
3,Very sheer. Fits as expected. I wear a medium and ordered a medium. Fit fine. How it's made there's a little extra space from under the bust down to the bottom. Nice for someone hiding a tummy. Only problem is it's very sheer. Definitely need a slip.,0
5,"It my choice to get a bigger size, XXL. I'm 5'11&#34; 160 lbs. Didn't want it too tight. Luv the shirt.",1
3,A little flimsy and loose. For some reason the sides are flexible which I personally didn‚Äôt like since it would slip off my face.,0
1,"The picture for the floral kimono with the border is so innacurate.  In real life this item is much, much sheerer, and the colors are not as rich or dark as pictured.  They are bright and vivid, almost neon like.  The colors & sheer fabric give the item an overall cheap look.",0
2,Looks much better in the picture. Its basically a cheap t-shirt that someone sloppily made cuts in the sleeves. You could do this yourself for only a few dollars and get a better result.,0
1,"Huge.  Like the other reviews, the band is stiff.  Returned it.",0
5,Soft and soooo cute!!,1
1,Crappy merchandise,0
5,"These are basically no larger than a Ladies Size 8 but worked great for my wife, size 7 1/2 ladies.",1
5,Great fit for a great price!,1
5,Cute lil bag. Fit what I needed it to which included my galaxy 9+,1
1,They are poor quality. I ordered 2 pair and they came in poor packaging and one of the lenses was out of the frame upon arrival and doesn't fit back in the frame.,0
5,"They were very well made, not cheap looking or costume like at all.  Great packaging so they wouldn‚Äôt arrive scratched.  I have a very small wrist so I had to return them.  They were more like bangles on me.",1
3,"The bra was super soft and I kept debating, but in the end it was just not supportive enough for me. The thin steaps seemed to just dig in a bit no matter how I adjusted it. But I really wanted to love it because it was so soft!",0
5,I got the red ostrich/crocodile textured one and WOW is it sturdy!!  This is my second Dasein briefcase purse and they last a good 2 years of solid use.  I am very pleased with my purchase!!,1
5,Love this rain jacket. The features are very well designed. Wears well without being noisy during movement,1
5,This was such a cute addition to the birthday gift I gave my best friend this year. Good quality and definitely worth it for the price.,1
1,Way too big.....but good design,0
3,Latching mechanism on the belt buckle holding survival kit needs to be stronge. Barely stays closed,0
5,Used these to label our toy bins.  We've had them for several months and they are holding up pretty well!,1
5,These are fabulous. I love the material.,1
1,"Poor packaging, etching black wood smelled and no backing ear post; plus, there was no return slip information!",0
2,They weren't as pretty as I expected,0
5,This pin in breathtaking. The blues are so pretty. The real thing is so much better than the pictures. Good quality pin. Very giftable.,1
1,"Very small, made for the wrist of an infant.",0
3,"It's cheap looking but nice. I wish it was heavier and thicker, all metal would be better.",0
5,Ought this for my toddler daughters first ballet recital. Worked perfectly. Fit was spot on,1
4,A little too snug around my hips  and elastic on arms a little snug.,1
5,Love it! Took long to get it in mail but i love it. I did not use the chain it came with But i did Fit it on the actual key Ring.,1
5,"Really lovely, comfy, casual easy skirt.  Nice for warm days, very lightweight and comfortable.  The print is cheery and the fabric surface is smooth.  It does wrinkle horribly.<br />If you are very short, this should not be too long; if you are very tall, you might find it shorter than it appears on the model.  I'm 5' tall, and I found it hit between midcalf and ankle.  I'm terrible at selfies, but I quickly through it on over my shorts, lol (so it won't be a snug in the hips as it appears) just to give you an idea of the length.",1
1,"These are shades of black, white and gray, not blue as pictured. Didn‚Äôt even take them out of the package so can‚Äôt comment on sizing.",0
1,The metal on the band changes color - poor quality,0
1,Nothing like the picture material is a thick cotton not jersey material like it looks in the picture... It's a ok nightgown I guess,0
5,Much nicer than expected.  I am pleasantly pleased.  Will definitely wear to Diamond back game.,1
3,It is cute.,0
2,These run very small. Order a size larger.,0
5,They were exactly what I needed on my trip/ flight. Very comfortable and they run true to size‚Ä¶ fitting.,1
1,horrible<br />Rolls off hands<br />Sticks to everything,0
5,Stunning pin,1
1,I recieved the wrong item I recieved a black bracelett I believe its a mans the latch is magnetic,0
2,I am a medium; I‚Äôve always been a medium. So I ordered a medium. Well the sleeves end halfway up my forearms and there is no way it hits my thigh as pictured. It hits at my waist! Too bad because the knitting is nice.,0
3,The fabric these are made from was irritating to my skin.,0
2,Cute but didn‚Äôt fit my feet well. Was sad to return them.,0
5,beautiful and feels great.,1
4,"More sheer than appears in the picture, but that's no problem. Fits great and looks great.",1
1,There is no pouch for your balls.,0
1,I bought two for some light cosplay and they did work well for that purpose. But then I washed them and they came out a few inches shorter. Beware!  These are more like lightweight sweaters than short sleeved hoodies.,0
5,Excellent shirt,1
2,"It's cute and the fabric was soft, but it was way too small",0
5,Beautiful.  Received So many compliments. Amazing Quality for such a reasonable price.,1
1,"I bought this belt because it looked and sounded nice. True to the pictures, it is beautiful. However, once I put it on, the ratchet part malfunctioned, and it would not come loose! Yes, I was depressing the release correctly, as I tried it several times before putting it on. After about 15 minutes of my wife and I trying to release it, we had to actually cut the belt off, as you can see in the pictures. If this happened half way thru the work day, it could be a more serious problem. Luckily, I was still at home, so I could grab a different belt. Don't be fooled by its good looks, it's cheap for a reason.",0
4,"Waited 30 days to receive it tho thats earlier than given estimated date. As i open the package, the stone design isn't glued on the ring. Fixed it with hot glue gun since that what they used. Still gave it 4 star since it is really cute. Haven't worn yet so it could break again when i do.",1
4,Nice and comfty,1
4,"Seemed a little short for a size 50. Needs more length after the holes. Otherwise, it's well made.",1
5,Good product,1
1,Not as pictured! Read the other reviews!,0
3,I put both key chains on our keys. Mine on my little backpack diaper bag. Broke an hour later. His broke at work the same night .. Both lost,0
1,They might work for a 10 year old kid. But too small for an adult.  Also they came with dangerous wires sticking out of them.  I returned next day.,0
2,Way smaller than size chart,0
3,Product runs 2 sizes too small.,0
2,It was too small.,0
4,"I got the size small which fits as a small should. For reference I am a petite dress size 4/6. The small had plenty of room and would still fit comfortably if I wanted to bundle up with a heavy wool sweater inside. There's a separate knit extension at the end of the sleeves, which is gathered and can be adjusted up or down, so would work for petite arms of any length without extra expense to alter sleeves to fit. Drawstrings waist level are a nice touch.<br /><br />Neither inner lining, nor hat can be removed for laundering. FYI the inner lining is best described as teddy bear material. This teddy bear like material lining is what prompted me to look at the tag closely, which only said ""wash dark colors separately"" followed by several laundry symbols, one of which I looked up and saw Do Not Tumble dry. If you didn't pay attention and put it in the dryer after wash I suspect the lining would come out clumpy and the faux fur would be ruined as well. I think the manufacturer should have spelled out the laundry instructions rather than reduce them to symbols. Allow extra time to air dry if you need to wash it during colder months.<br /><br />I also had an issue with the side pockets which had very small openings, so hands don't slip in and out easily, especially if you had on winter gloves. The side pockets are also somewhat shallow. I do like the two square pockets on the outside, which are roomy and fir my 6.75"" phone. There's one more pocket chest level, but it is very shallow and won't fit much.<br /><br />The jacket coat is warm, comfy and stylish on. However, I think the price is too high for a basic coat that lacks the details that coats at this price point should have. I was also expecting to see at least an inner pocket, but there was none. All in all an ok coat for casual wear, but this is not it for versatility and ease of care.",1
3,"Red,White and &#34;gray&#34;  Reduces glare on windshield. Eagle Eyes much better. Eliminates glare and I can see much better.",0
5,Bought these for my son....he wears them for working out and loves them,1
5,Love this sweater. Get compliments every time I wear it.  I‚Äôm a size medium and ordered extra large it fits perfect.  It‚Äôs more tan colored than the gray I expected but still very cute.,1
1,Cheaply made,0
5,Very comfortable and stylish!  Have had lots of compliments!,1
3,Nothing special.,0
1,These goggles broke after the first use. Save your money. Only giving one star because I had go in order to post a review.,0
2,"Lasted three months before the side split away from the back. Cute case, though.",0
4,"Luv the shirt color and graphic...some puckering around the graphic after machine drying.  Hoping it will even out after next wash, then ""hang dry"".  I usually wear medium, but ""small"" was available and glad I ordered it...runs a half size up.  Wore on the 4th of July and received nice compliments.",1
2,Too small,0
5,"So cute, so comfy and look like new still",1
5,"I bought this watch because I wanted something completely black that was also functional. I got it in this watch. It lacks some of the other bells and whistles that more expensive watches have but does everything I want it to. It's very rugged and has been through a lot and survived. For the price, I could not have asked for more.",1
5,An excellent necklace that I would definitely purchase again,1
3,The frames are very wide fall down my nose.,0
5,The fit of this dress is very flattering.  I have many comments on how pretty I look in it.  Love this dress so much I will order more of this style in the future.,1

5,Perfect fit! My daughter loved it. Great quality for the price,1
4,"great value. they look great, like a pair that costs 4x as much",1
1,Short,0
5,My son got it for me for my birthday. It is really good quality and silver plated.,1
5,So convenient to keep this hat rolled up in my purse and can whip it out any time I need sun protection. The fit is adjustable which is great for my small head. My friends make fun of me for looking like an old lady gardener but I just tell them I'll be making fun of them when they are all wrinkly from sun damage and I still look young! It's really good quality and even holds up well when it gets wet in a pool or the ocean.,1
1,Dislike the quality / material of the dress,0
3,We received this item with a large rip on the lace. I was not able to return because I purchased it well before my daughter started her dance season.<br />It would be pretty and it‚Äôs upsetting that it has to go into the garbage but the return window had already passed.,0
5,A little bit large for me but it's fine to be this size. Love it. Could wear in formal and casual occasions.,1
5,Very nice clutch. Bigger than expected but I liked that. Nice quality. Fast delivery.,1
4,"Everything about the shell is perfect, except the hood/collar. It was just too big for me, even with my helmet on. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a solid jacket.",1

5,"This is exactly what I wanted for doing household chores, yardwork, or exercise with equipment without damaging my engagement ring. I also plan on wearing it when we travel out of country in a month so as to not be a target of theft. My engagement ring is a 5.5 and slightly large. I typically wear a 5.25 and I bought a 5 in this ring and it's not too tight at all. I barely feel it and it's great! I've just been wearing my engagement ring on top of the Enso ring and it looks nice and doesn't feel strange. I don't take the Enso ring on and off very much because it does roll and becomes kind of annoying.",1
1,These are the worst Phish donut socks ever! I tired them on and when the socks stretch around your ankle they become faded and you see white instead of blue. My assumption is they used white fabric to make the sock and blue dyes to color it instead of making it with blue fabric. Does not look good at all.,0
1,This is flimsy and cheap looking.,0
4,"We needed a short robe with 3/4 sleeves for my elderly mother. This fit the bill nicely. The terry is a little on the thin side and is pilling just a tad when giving mom a backrub, but she likes it so, leave well-enough alone!",1
5,Perfect for my range bag!!!!! Great quality and fast shipping! Thanks so much!,1
5,These bands are remarkably similar to the band that came with my Fitbit. The colors are beautiful and the added loop to hold the end of the band in place is a nice touch.,1
5,The necklace was perfect made well. Worth the money. Looks really nice on great size thick chain and pendent was a good size.,1
5,Nice,1
3,"This could be a great credit card wallet, but it's not. The zipper is so tight it's almost impossible to open and shut without tugging when rounding the corners.  The leather is cheap and the inside card slots/pockets are either cardboard or skimpy leather backed with cardboard.  I am disappointed that this product which has excellent width (a passport easily slides into the inside pocket),many slots for credit cards, and a zipper that could have been a real help in securing contents, falls so short overall.",0
3,"Product as described but too cumbersome to use, returned",0
1,I bought these sweats in red and they were great. Bought the black sweats and they shrunk a good 4‚Äù when I washed them,0
3,"The item is fairly well made for the exception of the near-useless back pocket (thin material, crappy zipper), but I can't say it has any advantage over an ordinary pencil bag you might find in any school kid's backpack. The things you strap in will snag other things if you try to pull it out of a backpack and it's too bulky to fit into a slim space. The product would be really good if it were attached to something, like a kitchen/bathroom wall or maybe the dashboard of a car. Or the space station. It would be great on the ISS. I should sent this to Cape Canaveral so they can send it on the next rocket up. The shipping to Florida would be cheaper than the $8 Amazon wants for returning this thing.",0
5,GReat birthday gift! Arrived in one day with assistance from Amazon. Rugged and durable. A great buy for the money. Will be giving more as gifts for Christmas!,1
1,Doesn't stay on at all- it was gone within the first hour.,0
2,"This product seems to run small, and if you are looking for something a little more modest than the traditional swimsuit, this is not for you. It was quite revealing at the top and stopped very short. Other than the sizes I loved the material and colors",0
5,"I took the keychain apart and sewed them on individually to my fanny pack. I also took the key ring with Keroppi's name and connected it to the zipper pull. Charms are approximately 1 inch in size. Name plate is approximately 1.5 inches. The charms are thick and heavy duty, will not break. SUPER HAPPY!!",1
1,Product came with one lens only,0
1,Just freaking ugly,0
1,I had to take a piece from my notebook to fix the strap.,0
5,Fairly priced but the picture makes it seem bigger and it came to me smaller than i thought it was gonna be.,1
5,I get many compliments in this sweater because of the unique sleeve design. It is comfy and has maintained quality over many wears and washes.,1
5,good,1
5,"Beautifully designed tote bag with a huge interior. I can easily fit my laptop, 2 binders, and several notebooks for work. It is the perfect accessory for any student or teacher.",1
4,"I ordered an XL because I'm rather busty, a DD to be exact. The bottoms fit fine but the top is a tad small. My &#34;bust&#34; busts out a little lol. Other than that it's great",1

2,"Extremely long, hits mid thigh on me at 5' 6"". Tight across the chest and tent like everywhere else. Maybe it would be okay belted.",0
5,Brings many compliments!,1
1,I would give less than 1 if I could. I bought 2 of these. One was for my son and one for my husband to carry their diabetic supplies. The insides are all pulled apart and the straps are broken on both. Total waste of money.,0
5,"I have had so much trouble finding hoops for my nose piercing.  I also have trouble keeping nose piercings in.  I usually use the &#34;L&#34; shaped  posts but everytime I get out of the shower they always seem to get caught on my towel and pull out, never to be seen again!!<br /><br />I finally found a hoop that has a ball that screws on and that's the only one that has stayed in my nose.  Then I saw these so I ordered them right away.  I received them today and immediately put one in.  There are 5 rings in the package and it is awesome that each ring is in a separate plastic bag and then the small bags are in a plastic case.  It makes it so much easier not to lose any.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll lose these.  They don't screw in but they have the flat piece on one side.  So I put it in from the inside of my nose out so the flat metal piece is on the inside of my nose.  The ring didn't move a lot today.  I noticed once where it moved but it was no where near falling out.  If it does come out I can only think it would happen in bed at night, but the ring is big enough that I would see it in my bed.  Overall I'm extremely satisfied with them and would recommend them.<br /><br />*Disclaimer:  I received this product either free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review of the product.  Even though I did get this for free or at a reduced rate, I am committed to giving that honest review to help the company make any changes, if necessary, to improve their product.

2,"This hat is supposed to be a slouchy style where the top is long enough to slightly fold over to the side or the back. I had purchased one that was not lined and a different color and it fit beautifully. This hat seems to be made for children. It is very small. The top that is supposed to slouch over actually stands up straight so that I look like a conehead. Luckily, I have a small head so I can wear it to knock around the house and while working outside, but it is not attractive with such a small fit. The hat is warm and comfortable, though a little tight because it is sized too small. I would not purchase again because the product is not as advertised.",0
3,"The material was not what I expected. Pictures look more cotton and it is very polyester looking. The length is deceiving. I bought a 10 for my daughter and it fits up too but goes to her mid calf, but ankle. Much shorter than the picture. She likes it so we will keep it, but I felt disappointed by the length and that it looks like it is pretty cheaply made.",0
5,These are great. My feet feel so much better since I have been wearing them. These are the extra wide so plenty of room for my toes to be comfortable.,1
1,Broke within 2 weeks of using. I used it for one whole week and took if off to change to a different band. Couple days later I changed back to this one and that same day it broke. My watch fell on the floor.,0

4,Very cute light weight sweater.,1
5,"There is nothing that I dislike about this dress.  It is stunning and it looks just like the pictures!  I will be wearing it to my daughters wedding in February, after that I will post pictures of it on as well.  You will not be disappointed in this dress at all.  I have looked at many and nothing comes close to this for me.  I love it and may even wear it to other events also.  I love this color also, as I didn't want anything to bright or dull, this color is just right, it is simply an amazing dress, I cannot wait to wear it :)",1
1,Wow the color is nothing like advertised. I needed a mustard yellow like in the pic but instead it was this hideous brownish yellow. I was sent a L/XL instead of the medium I ordered. It was good though bc a medium NEVER would have fit. I typically wear a size 6 jeans as comparison.<br />The material is not at all forgiving. Soft as could be and would be fine in loose comfy pants I suppose. But these are not that. I am returning them. Quality is fine I assume. Couldn‚Äôt see any direct flaws in that regard.,0
1,"Beautiful but will break after only wearing it a few times.Avon jewelry use to be well made something to be proud to wear.Sorry I purchased this item.To only end up in the trash.I know it's too late to get a refund so I didn't bother.The few times I got to wear it got compliments.Then the chain broke,earrings wouldn't stay on.I loved it wished it would have lasted.Sadly to say no I wouldn't buy this again.",0
3,Way to big. Runs huge,0
3,"Pretty dress, sheer. Too small for the sizing chart I used.  Worked for my sister who looks like she doesn't eat, not for me- who has mom boobs & had a 4th baby.  I'm 6' & thought the length was nice... just too tight around bust.",0
4,cool hat and design but it feels like a stickers quality,1

3,very thin and not as large as i thought they would be,0
4,"I liked how it came with two extra buttons so I could replace them twice if they got ripped off. I did not like how it had a plastic zipper I can see that won't last that long the price was cheep enough I thought it would cost this much the fabric is too thin, but I guess its ok.",1
1,Not good quality,0
1,"This is advertised as polyester/spandex, but the tag says 95% Rayon/ 5% spandex, which means it will SHRINK!",0
2,"I'm glad these glasses came in a two pack.  I put the first pair on to check the fit and when I removed them, the arm broke! I didn't have them on for 30 seconds!  Very disappointed.  But, the other pair has done well and I wear them every day.",0
2,Ordered an xs fits like a medium,0
3,"I wear it occasionally, the arms fit tighter than I like.  Since it's a one size fits all, it looks kind of like a maternity shirt on me and makes me look a little heavier than normal.",0

5,[[VIDEOID:e6fa272ec77dcc814757a417f9923d6b]] This ankle bracelet really stood out!! Really blingy and pops with a really cute outfit such as the one I wore with it on this occasion! Definitely worth the price,1
3,Looks great on! Band itself it great quality<br />One side of the clasp wouldn‚Äôt stay on the watch.<br />Refund was quick. Going to try again to see if it was a one off,0
2,These are so cool to watch change when wet but the blue one broke after first time using it :( cheaply made,0

3,"Very,very,very,very tiny. Maybe size up if you want real accuracy",0
2,We bought these for Thanksgiving and most of them broke the first time we put them on.,0
1,My daughter has worn them a total of 5 times before the squeaker broke. Replaced the squeakers with the extra set they provide and they still don‚Äôt work. Must be a defect with the shoe itself. They‚Äôre still very cute as shoes that don‚Äôt squeak tho. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy them again.,0
4,I'm 5'2&#34; and 170 lbs; I feel as if it could be a little tighter to compress more but it's great. I plan to buy more in the near future,1
1,"I ordered this dress because on the picture, it looks absolutely beautiful. However, when I received the dress, the top that goes over the dress fit, perfectly, the dress itself was three or four sizes smaller. When I contacted the seller, I was told to send it back to China. I contact Amazon customer service explain the situation to them and they immediately refunded my money. The seller is located in China, but contacted someone here in New York to have me send the address there. I was told they would pay for the postage. I sent the address to the address in New York , but as of this writing, I have not received the postage refund. So be careful when ordering items just make sure they‚Äôre in America.",0
5,"Loved the color blue of these cufflinks. Even prettier and nicer when they arrived. The package was wrapped in a small plastic baggie for each cufflink, with a box, WITH a small jewelry case to put them in. Loved it!",1

2,"The vest fits well.  I would like it a little taller but I normally order tall sized items, so that is just me.  This is my second vest.  I returned the first because the elements did not seem to warm as nicely as other warming items I have tried out.  My replacement is maybe 20% better.  The heating areas are not placed as well as they should be and do not warm nearly as well as other brands.  I am still going to keep the product as it does serve the function, just not very well.  I don't suggest it to anyone else though.",0
2,"The jeans are cute, however the color is not at all what it looked like online. I ordered the vintage and they look a little dirty to me. Also, they‚Äôre too small. The style is cute.",0
1,Broke very quickly.,0
1,I had to return them three times for different sizes but literally those different sizes are all same sizes.,0
3,Can not fairly rate the shoe...size too small.  Returned.  Ordered same pair in full size larger.  Wait until those arrive and I can answer other questions fairly.,0

Added cute patches to mine that I got off Amazon too,1
5,Amazing!,1
2,"I bought a size up based on previous reviews. I'm a little person so I bought a medium and can't breathe. So, now I I have another one coming as I bought 2 and I'll be stuck or need to lose 25 Pound",0
2,Necklace is nice but you should let customer's know that there are three different styles they might get . The one I got is not the one in the first picture.,0
3,Okay belts but ONLY FOR BIG PEOPLE!  I found them to be way-too-big!,0
5,I bought this for my wife for our 15 year anniversary and she loves it!  She wore it everyday on our cruise.  It's the perfect size for her.,1
5,Colors are great. Nice fabric. Going to hand stitch the hem shorter.,1
4,"The earrings are beautiful and they are the perfect size. The only thing that I can say was wrong is that they were not screw-on backs as the description states and the picture shows. Aside from that, great product and well worth the money.",1

4,I am losing weight so I'm not sure if the fit is right or small. I love the suit.,1
2,"Love the dress, however, the way the pockets are design makes for an aweful and unflattering fit...need to go back to the drawing board...obviously no one has tried these dresses on.  Also I shouldnt have to spend extra $$ to alter the pockets...",0
3,"Color and fabric is nice and I like the size and organization of the compartments. However, one of the front zippers is jammed and I have only used it once.",0
5,Nice and reasonably priced,1
3,Great quality and keeps you warm. But they sent me the wrong size I had ordered and now I have to return it for a smaller size. This was a gift so that‚Äôs a bit frustrating.,0

3,"It's ok, doesn't look quite as nice in person as on line",0
3,Item is extremely big. I ordered my size and a smaller size and it was 3x the size. I couldn‚Äôt wear the dress and had to return. I like the design and I‚Äôd advise to order a few sizes smaller than your regular size.,0
5,"I love the the idea, the design, the quality of the construction, the charm, the subtlety, the whimsey. Surprisingly roomy inside. The doily makes it. :) I took it to a dance already and all the ladies went wild over it. It's a dream bag, my forever bag. Thank you Kate Spade. I am sad that you had to leave us so soon!",1

5,So nice,1
5,Just loved it,1
2,"These are beautiful, but I find them a bit bulky. I will most likely gift them to other people. As I like a more sleek look with my Apple Watch.",0
2,"This necklace loks just as pictured, except the &#34;stones&#34; are not shaped, they are just rounded. Also, though I understand it is a statement necklace, this thing is MASSIVE. I haven't been able to wear it because it is just so clunky. Perhaps on a larger frame it balances out, but this thing doesn;t suit my body.",0
5,This dress is great. However it's not exactly true to size but that shouldn't really pose a problem because it has so much give in the material. I love the color it's more of a dark plum and the length is perfect. I will be wearing this on my cruise in a few months so I ordered it just in time. This dress has a soft material and 3/4&#34; sleeves which can be rolled up a bit if needed.  I purchased this dress at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.,1
1,very bab product,0

2,"Glasses are good quality for the price. However, I received a yellow pair instead of the orange pair depicted in the purple/green/orange 3-pack. Not shipped by Amazon, so not worth the trouble of trying to return or re-order. Beware if you're expecting specific colors.",0
5,"These run small. I am usually a size 7, but I ordered size 8 and they fit great. Very comfortable snickers.",1
3,tight through the chest. I am only a flabby c cup and struggled pushing them puppies in there.  do not get if busty. cute dress though. nice material. not very much give in the material.,0
5,Excellent! Received what I expected with a quick delivery. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase. Only thing...which was harmless because it was fabric is that it was tightly compressed into a plastic envelope. At first I thought &#34; there couldn't possibly be an XL sweatsuite in this&#34;. But it puffed out pretty well. I'd definitely seek out this seller again. Thanks!,1
1,Necklace not completed looks mass-produced and came with missing pieces.Will be returning,0
5,"I've had three pairs for years - I love crazy socks with jeans.  They fit well, wash well in the machine (altho I don't usually put them in the dryer), hold their shape and colors very well.  Medium thickness, best with running shoes or boots or roomy casual shoes.  Decided it was time for some more.  The new ones are as well-made and comfy as the old ones.",1
5,"Beautiful watch, appears to be high quality materials and well made. Time will tell if it‚Äôs quality lives up to its looks.",1
2,"I desperately wanted to love this, because I am overly fond of things not on this planet. But.<br />* The image was pasted in off-centre, leaving a crescent of non-image all along one side.<br />* That empty crescent also got glow-in-the-dark treatment on it, so it's extra obvious in the dark.<br />* The adhesive wasn't applied uniformly (it's like a wonky hourglass across the middle), so the glare of lights off it creates a really weird and distracting effect.<br /><br />This is all sad because the image is just as I'd like otherwise, and the glow is great once you let it spend some time charging in the light.<br /><br />(I hate to leave a negative review, as I'm sure there's some harried individual or sweatshop making these, but this sort of thing reminds me to ask local artist friends who have done similar things if I can buy something like this from them instead.)",0

3,Fine in quality but returned.  Did not fit my watch.,0

5,fits very nice,1
5,I took this to New York during a snowstorm. It fit over my puffy coat and small purse. Kept me dry and packed up easily. Now it stays in my car for future use in Southern rainy season.,1
3,"My kid loved this for halloween and received lots of great comments from other trick-or-treaters.  Unfortunately, it arrived with a short circuit in the DC connector that caused the fan to start and stop intermittently and there wasn't time to send it back, so I had to splice the wire with a wire-stripper and electrical tape to make a direct connection from the fan to the battery box.  The on/off switch still functions as normal, it just means the costume and battery box are forever linked and must be put on simultaneously.",0
4,"When my kids‚Äô wear them, we‚Äôve received some compliments. I like the adjustable string and different colors & images. It helps keep my kids‚Äô mask around their neck and works well in that regard.<br />The only negative is that we‚Äôve broken a few as the clip snapped from the elastic string. Lost about 3 so far and only had three a few weeks.<br />But the price was fair comparably. However I have seen the price fluctuate a bit which must be a supply/demand thing. It‚Äôs gone up about 15%+. Still a good price.<br />I recommend the product on price, variety and practicality. But took away a star from the manufacturing.",1
5,"I have an Autistic son who likes to wear and hide my reading glasses.  Because I need them for homeschooling and for teaching college in the evening, let alone my writing and editing on the weekend, I found myself desperate for additional pair in case my seeking turns out too frustrating.  I tried these on at night while he was sleeping and they were clearer than the ones I have been using for a year.  I loved them.  My husband happened to come around the corner as I placed the blue frames on and was very impressed with the design and overall look.  I was greatly relieved to feel that the frames were sturdy and the fit tight.  I'm hiding them now, but will be using them as my sole pair for work in the evenings come this fall as they are adorable and a better fit than my others.  Thank you!",1
5,Just what I was looking for.  I love it.,1
4,Clasp is weak and she kept losing it from falling off the wrist .,1
3,"Its a nice size and very pretty, but it did not come with a strap.  It's very misleading.",0
2,My daughters was true to size but my bottoms fit however the top was too small. They should let you pick a size for the top separate from the bottom.,0
1,Some of them were good but I had a lot that wouldn‚Äôt even fit a few that were damaged and had to be trash,0
1,Broke the first day.,0
2,"Had to return, not as flexible as I like and was slipping on the floor",0
4,"Quality fabric, perfect color, great fit.  I am 5'7 150lbs I and 34DDD. The best is a little tight on me but the dress fits great. Ordered a size M. Wrinkles easily. My husband loves it. 4 stars because the dress does not flank out, rather lays a bit flat. Ordered a under skirt that will make it poof out a bit. Overall great buy!",1
1,This item is wayyy too small. I‚Äôm usually a 1x but I had a feeling this would run small so I got a 3x and it‚Äôs still too small.,0
4,"Purchased the black with the embroidery down the front. I bought a large. I'm 5'6"". I've worn it at my highest weight, which was 210 lbs, and my lowest, 175lbs. My chest size is a ~38DD, and I wear between a 10-14 pants. It did shrink a bit lengthwise, but it's still hits my thigh at an appropriate length, although, I wouldn't bend over and touch my toes. I learned my lesson: cold water to wash and dry on very low heat for about 15 min to get the wrinkles and stiffness out then hang to dry for the remainder.  I love the pockets, and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. Most people are very surprised I got it off of amazon because the embroidery is so well done. Will probably buy another in a different color.",1
1,They looked great when they arrived. But after the first wash you lose most of the length. So what was a large is now a belly shirt. Kid does not like the fit at all.,0
4,"Ordered 2 colors Gray/Brown in the 8/53-54 length but had to drill a hole in the pole as it did not quite fit. Only had to drop the hole down a couple of inches as it would not stretch to fit correctly in the existing.Other then that the umbrella replacement is good.NOW, I hope the Squirrels leave it alone and seek other materials for their nests!!!",1
1,If you are plus size or just have big boobs. This will do nothing for you and it hurts. Don‚Äôt waste your money.,0
3,"I bought this bag for a 6-month trip to Europe and North Africa. The ‚Äúlocking‚Äù zipper on the main compartment broke about 2 months into the trip and security was kind of the point of buying the bag. I also found the layout of the bag to be somewhat awkward. I thought I‚Äôd get used to it after 6 months but it just never really worked for me organization-wise (one simple addition would be a pen pocket). It is a roomy bag and the end pockets easily held a water bottle or umbrella. These pockets are short, however, and tall bottles will fall out. Bottom line, I wouldn‚Äôt buy this bag again.",0
5,"Very pleasantly surprised with these pants! I'm 5'7, ~130lbs and usually wear a 6 to 8. They only had 4-10 left, i thought it would be too small but ordered anyway and i'm glad i did! They fit great, i love the color and the material too",1
5,I'm told they fit,1
4,"I‚Äôll try to give this a fair review, considering it just doesn‚Äôt personally work for me. I like to wear modest, loose fitting clothing - so in my attempt to make this work, it was baggy on me. (Size L) I loved the pictures and had looked at this exact color so many times I finally ordered it to try it. But I will be returning it, as it wasn‚Äôt quite flattering, and not dressy enough for my brothers‚Äô weddings. Due to the stretch fabric, I did not prefer the way the stitching in the seams stretched and made it seem not as sharp...",1
1,Watch keeps stopping even put in fresh battery date keeps changing doesn‚Äôt keep up,0
1,The quality of the chain was really bad and easy to break,0
1,"I ordered this 3 sizes bigger than my usual size to be able to wear it as an oversized shirt dress and it didn‚Äôt fit at all‚Ä¶. Must be Chinese sizes or something. Horrible quality, not oversized.",0
5,Perfect,1
4,Good quality.  I'm using this as a doggy collar bow tie!  Just sew on to the collar and viola.,1
5,This 2inch pin is adorable! I‚Äôm so happy to have it in my collection. Wonderful quality as well.,1
3,I did not receive the glasses shown in the photo. The ones I received have a light yellow lens. The fit seemed ok (though I didn‚Äôt really test them) but the yellow lens is useless for where I live in the southwest. I sent them back.,0
3,"So. I didn‚Äôt receive the long dangle earrings I ordered. I receive these hoop earrings which are lovely, just not what I ordered for graduation gift.",0
5,"My 16 year old has gauges and lives to shop at Hot Topic. I don't like spending what they charge, so this set was a big hit with the interesting designs and 5 pair for the price of one.",1
4,I didn‚Äôt get the distressed jeans. They‚Äôre regular ones. I like them so I‚Äôll keep them.,1
1,The earrings are pretty but the chain keeps moving and cause it to be off balance. I had to ask my husband to smash the top to keep the chain from moving..they didn‚Äôt make an effort to secure the chain welded to keep it from moving.,0
1,"This dress (in white) is 100% see through! The lining is a thin fleece, which is kind of nice, but shows EVERYTHING.  Fit is as expected. I ordered a small, I'm 5', 110 lbs, it hits just below the knee. The size/fit wasn't the issue, it's just poor quality, maybe it isn't as bad with the darker colors.",0
1,The dress looks absolutely nothing like the picture.  I do not recommend.,0
2,"The color and texture and overall quality of this ring was lower than I expected. I was expecting more of an olive tone as advertised and it's more of a bluish-green, also with less ridges. I also was unaware that this ring is made of reconstituted turquoise which is made of pulverized turquiose powder mixed with resin and plastic and dyes. Obviously I shoulld ha e paid more for a ring if I wanted a nicer quality, but this didn't seem worth $20.",0
5,Looked great on him and fit as expected.,1
3,"I was super excited to get these leggings becaue they are really cute, but they're see-through :(",0
1,Poor fit and fabric quality. I had to return it,0
5,Great replacement lenses. they are easy to install and I've had no issues with scratching when properly stored.,1
3,good but too small for me,0
2,"Lenses are FAR too dark.  They float which is awesome.  And they look different.  They're comfy, too, as the hinges are springy and expand outward as needed.  But the fact that everything looks dark through these completely ruins it.  My friends that have worn them say the same thing.  Compared to any decently priced sunglasses ($50+), the difference is (almost literally) night & day.<br /><br />If they start making these with higher quality lenses, I'd wear them all the time!<br /><br />By the way, I bought these directly from Swell, not Amazon.  The shipping was nice and the case is very high quality.",0
5,Very warm. Will be.perfect for skiing in the colorado mountains,1
5,Beautiful pin! I love it,1
5,Needed an addition to my chakra prayer meditation,1
1,"The sandals are beautiful, but when I try it on the part that goes between my toes broke trying to fit in",0
1,"I have this skirt in black, same size. Worn once. The black one is great. Fits me snugly, as it should. I‚Äôm an actual real life size 16, 5‚Äô5, 190lbs. It didn‚Äôt fit at 206üôÑ.<br />The black skirt worked so well (I‚Äôm super happy with it, tons of compliments), that I thought I‚Äôll order red for a costume I need for the weekend.<br />The red size 16, is an inch tighter in the waist, which would be uncomfortable but I could manage. It‚Äôs the 4 inch difference in the backside that is a real issue. I can‚Äôt begin to close it. Also, the red dye really smells bad.<br /><br />I‚Äôve learned that I need to order larger sizes on Amazon, but at least be consistent on sizes for the exact same items. I‚Äôm really bummed.<br /><br />On a side note, in case anyone is wondering, I got this to match a red and black corset from the same clothing line, hoping it would be the same pattern. It wasn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs close enough to work. My black skirt and corset aren‚Äôt the same pattern either, but they look fine together. The two pieces are often suggested together, so I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm not the only person trying to match them up.",0
5,Omg I love my dress fits üòç perfectly,1
2,"The shorts seemed like decent material with good stitching however, the were much shorter than they appear in the picture, only about a 1 inch inseam. I have an athletic build (5'4&#34; 125lbs and got a size 4/6) and these fit in the waist but were awkwardly tight at the hem on my thighs and very loose in-between the waist and hem. I really wanted to love these but they were very unflattering and I returned them.",0
1,I like the style and the color but the faster hook keeps falling apart,0
4,"Sizes run smaller than stated.  I will still wear this, but  good to size 1-2 up.",1
3,It was an awesome red that went with the theme for pictures I wanted. It looked nice on me and I was comfortable in it all day! Will buy from this company again!,0
1,"Very cute, but had to return cause they were too small and they were the same size as my other JB I ordered",0
5,Kinda short but it's good to wear after 5! ;-),1
1,"I just wear this earring for the first time last month on my cruise, and one broke while trying to put it on.",0
2,"Disappointed in these as they aren't dark enough in strong sunlight. The color is cute and sporty , though.",0
4,"The Roc Bodywear Men‚Äôs Body Slimming Compression Shirt worked miracles for my boyfriend. As soon as he put it on, he instantly stood straighter and looked as if he had lost several inches on his midsection. The shirt is very comfortable and is made of fabric that allows easy breathing. The nice thing about it is there are no bumps or bulges that show where the shirt is compressing. It is very smooth under clothing and does not show through other shirts like some shape wear does. For my boyfriend, he instantly felt more confident and made him motivated to go and workout more than he already does. It does a great job at firming his body and making him feel like an overall more confident person! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
1,"too small, returned item",0
1,"These cases look like the picture in the description, but are not the same quality as similar looking ones that came with my sunglasses. These cases are paper thin and can easily be crushed, offering limited protection for sunglasses. Not at all what I expected.",0
3,I gave a 3 because these where two sizes to small and it came with a hole in the side of the black shirt. Other than that they are good.,0
3,The opals we beautiful.  A little smaller han I thought they would be but I lost one by the second night.  think the backing was just a little to loose.,0
5,Fantastic quality!!!,1
5,Good,1
1,Was expecting a black and white plaid blanket scarf and got one that is off white and royal blue? returning it.,0
5,Love these panties. They fit perfectly and the price is good.,1
5, ,1
2,"I had it for a couple of months, I really do not have it hanging but at the end it was literally hanging by a thread",0
1,"What a huge disappointment. I ordered this suit in XXXL and XXXXL. I tried the XXXL on first, and was surprised when I tried on the XXXXL next and it was actually much smaller and less supportive than the smaller size. After examining the two suits, I quickly realized that this was because they were actually two completely different styles. The smaller-sized suit had boning on the sides in addition to the underwire that really added support - the larger size had no boning, was stitched completely differently, and the colors were very off and did not match each other amongst the two suits. Also, the smaller-sized suit came with a HOLE in the side. Really bummed and will return.",0
4,The dress is super cute and it does fit me but just a little snug. I have big chest and it's hard for me to find stuff that fit without being baggy. The material is a little see through but I do have white/nude under garments that I can wear.,1
3,"Thick and warm, very good quality. However they run big, I put in the dryer, the pants shrunk and became a bit too short.",0
1,Not meant for an adult sized head and the picture you can barely make out what it is.,0
5,"Loved it very sweet and exactly what I expected!  I had some injuries recently, and I wear it to remind me to go slow and be persistent",1
1,"I made it work, it was very nice but as I barely wore it out and drove to my destination. I noticed the knee bone peeling off and other parts. Good for one use only.",0
5,Bought these for my boyfriend.  He's happy with them I like the colors so we're both happy üòä,1
4,"I ordered a size small.  (5‚Äô2. 112lbs and petite, pear shape). My lower body is bigger so I could understand that it felt tight there but the arms were also very tight.  I usually order a small so I would definitely recommend sizing up.",1
3,"*I have yet to put them in and see if they last - my piercing is a little tender*<br />My order came after 16 days, and I'm missing one clicker, I'll be contacting the seller and editing this with an update.<br />They only have a 3 right now because one is missing and the skull in particular looks different in irl. It's eyes are more shaped like sunglasses than two individual sockets.<br />5/24/17",0
3,A beat gift for my best friend. She liked it but said it itched her neck.,0
1,"üòµMade cheaply, HUGE and stretched out(must be made for alien facesüëΩ, not human faces, lol).",0
5,I have these on all my running shoes. Have arthritis and these stretch. Love them,1
3,"I loved the dress, there was just discoloration at the neckline, so returned it",0
5,"This watch is lovelier in person, came with warranty and a tool to remove links. Shipping was super quick. Solar watch, very feminine but not too small to read. Very happy with this purchase.",1
4,The only thing this is missing is pockets... it would be complete with pockets.,1
1,The photo was not great,0
1,Too small,0
5,Feels great and seems to be good quality. I would definitely buy again if they wear out.,1
2,The product seems to be built well and looks even better in person. Problem is it runs super small.. I ordered her normal size and it is at least two sizes smaller therefor we had to give it away,0
1,"No true to size at all, I had to give it away.",0
5,Great!,1
1,not true to size,0
5,LOVE THIS DRESS,1
3,"This is a quality made item, great hoodie, but there's no way it's a dress. I'm 5'8 and it doesn't reach all the way over my butt and hips. It's about 5 inches too short. But it makes a great, slightly long hoodie.",0
2,"This shirt is cute, but it is not made for larger ladies. It fit just great, the material was great, but the cut is really weird. The first ruffle started right between my chest and my stomach and emphasized every place I would not want it to emphasize.",0
5,I bought these for my daughter's Mey Rin cosplay. They are oversized. The frame is absolutely amazing. They are metal and not flimsy in the least. I like them and the fit the cosplay well.,1
5,"These are perfect shorts and an excellent value.  I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù 195 pounds and short waisted.  I  ordered a size 14 in navy.  They fit great and are well made. The navy color is a lovely rich medium blue, lovely.  Lots of inside reinforcement.  I was a seeking a dressier short and these are perfect. I highly recommend.",1
4,It runs pretty big. I recommend to get a size smaller. I normally get a large and it fits like an extra large.,1
3,If you have a big head it would be perfect.  I realize how to wear it scrunched but with no hair it swallows up my entire head.  Unfortunately it will have to go back which breaks my heart because its so pretty.,0
5,"Great pants, fit perfectly. Comfortable material (90% cotton, 10% elastan). The waist is not too high and not too low, just perfect.<br /><br />Would definitely buy those again.",1
5,It would be much better to only have one magnet. Very awkward to put on.,1
5,You can get real comfortable in this little dress.love it.,1
2,"I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to put the top together, but just couldn't figure it out. Returned it.",0
1,"I dont think this is leather, I am pretty sure it is vinyl and the strap doesn't look like the one pictured. The strap is made out of a ribbon. The case is well made, but it isnt leather.  The strap and clasp are less than satisfactory so I bought a new strap.",0
5,"So Beautiful ! Not too small , not too big & the quality is great. They're even more pretty in person .",1
5,"I have a Griswalds t shirt, fun to hear the comments from people.  Nice fit with the mask.",1
2,Not true to size..to small,0
5,It's a little see through (which is sort of expected since I got white). Super Comfy!,1
4,"Its a bit baggy up-top but if I slide it to the top of my arm it fits just fine. It doesn't really fall down too often so I'm satisfied. I use it to stay warm actually at work since I can't wear arm warmers. Keeping in mind I don't think that, that it's purpose, it works semi-okay",1
4,"Cute, soft. Wondering if they shrunk a tad after the first wash. 2.5 yo daughter loves them regardless!",1
5,"These are beautiful, easy to use, and I just love them",1
5,I use my scarf for head wraps I have a lot of colors,1
5,It looks very nice in person... You pay for what you get so it was worth what I paid.. (:,1
3,"I like the print and color. It runs a little big, so I had to size down. Also, it is very thin material. Not much compression so you don‚Äôt feel as well contained as other leggings. I will use for around the house and short errands.",0
5,I bought this for my friend for her 28th birthday and the only thing she doesn't like about it is her mother keeps trying to take it from her,1
2,I like this product as far as fit and comfort but the waistband of one of six pair was unraveling when I took them out of the package. I trimmed the lose threads and figured I would just keep them but they are almost completely unusable after a handful of wearings and washings.  Now a second pair has started to unravel. I sent feedback to Amazon earlier today and got no response. I cannot recommend them. They are not well stitched to hold up for a reasonable amount of time.,0
4,The image on the shirt is vinyl so I‚Äôm not sure how it will hold up over time. Overall a good purchase,1
5,This is a great backpack! It has more room than I imagined. It's really durable.,1
4,"It was a great style but it just fit a little too snug. It ""fit"" but I prefer my shirts a little more loose fit.",1
5,My daughter loves them!!!,1
4,looks like the pic,1
5,Very pretty.,1
2,"it's not sensitive enough, I have to use a stylist in order to type on my phone or you need to press really hard in order for the phone to respond.",0
3,Still too hot. Went back to thin cotton socks for less money too.,0
5,"Great shirt, nice pockets, well made.",1
1,"After 3 months of use, the pendulum fell off center.  The motor works but my watches get bounced of the edges of the box.",0
2,Does not click w Fitbit.  Cannot use!,0
5,Very pretty,1
4,Ok,1
3,"Design was nice, material was hard to breathe with when on. I also bought them for my son and daughter (xs) and it was too big for them and fit my adult face. It‚Äôs weird because I also bought a different design by the same seller at an xs as well and that was smaller then these masks. So it‚Äôs luck of the drawl.",0
5,really nice,1
1,"Fell apart really fast, never had converse do that before?",0
5,Absolutely love this dress! I usually wear a size small but I ordered a size medium and it fit perfectly. It's a stunning dress and I received many complaints on it last night.,1
5,I wear as an suit lapel pin.  It a cute pin.,1
1,Great for kids.  Not for adult sized mouths.  They are way too small.,0
3,"the belt holes do not lineup at all they are too big by far and my smaller belt barely fits as I have to use the largest setting and there's no leftover. So now I have to buy a leather punch to make a new hole or two in this belt, which will cost me more $$.",0
5,Nice little charms‚Ä¶used them to make earrings for a fundraiser!,1
4,Hat is super cute and fits my large head.  It is packaged in a small box and arrives squished.  I‚Äôm hoping some of the dimples go away when I wear it.,1
5,The necklace is really pretty. The earrings are a little too granny looking for me but I will use them in a craft project.,1
1,Disappointed.Not as expected.  I was expecting thick winter socks based on the description.  Received what appears to be  thin summer socks.  Will be returning.,0
5,This is the third pair of these earrings I have ordered for my granddaughter.  She loves them and wears them all the time therefore tends to loose or forgets where she puts them thus the frequent orders.,1
5,"Beautiful, it is as every describes.",1
5,"Wow this vest is amazing! I purchased it for my father for Christmas and he thanks me all the time! Before, he was always so cold when working outside but now he has nothing to worry about! He is able to work effectively without feeling cold like before. The fit is great and it is also slim so it fits perfectly under his coat. Overall would recommend to the outdoor lovers in your life!",1
4,This is cute top. It‚Äôs more of a long sleeve shirt than a sweater. It‚Äôs also very fitted and runs a bit small.,1
2,Had to return. It was nothing like the picture.,0
2,"I'm typically a 4 and I ordered a 4, but it's just too small. I wanted to wear it to a friend's wedding, but it looked more like a cheap club dress. Had to return.",0
5,It is made well and fits very well. My daughter wore it for a kitty costume on Halloween but I'm pretty sure it would serve it's purpose for young dancers as well.,1
5,"These sunglasses are perfect and look better than the photos. But the seller is bad, as he sent me faulty sunglasses not symmetric as the right lense is too close to my face and touching my face and eyes all the time unlike the left lense. I tried to fix it but in vain",1
5,Nice.,1
3,"Ordered a large because I am bigger chested, it fit more like a tent, it's cute if its tucked the right way, but I would not recommend this on it's own if you have a large chest. Goes great with a cardigan or jacket!",0
1,"I love the cut of these pants and bought the black and olive colors. After washing them once, inside out and on delicate, both pairs ripped at the pocket seams. I literally wore them once. Save your money.",0
1,THIS DOES NOT FIT PANDORA bracelets. It is to SMALL to go on the opening of the pandora bracelet.,0
5,"I loved the material, the style, the length and fit.",1
5,Very breathable - fits on ears comfortably,1
1,Mala calidad,0
1,The earring was so tiny it didn‚Äôt ever fit my daughter. One wouldn‚Äôt snap closed. Waist of money,0
1,Everything,0
1,This product is not well made.  Very light.  And very thin.  I do not recommend.  Take business elsewhere.  Much better product with honest descriptions.,0
5,loved it!,1
1,"Poorly constructed, no boning, ordered 5X received M",0
5,Good,1
4,Fairly good quality and  easy to use.  The plastic parts making up the locking mechanism can be thicker then I would rate it 5 stars instead,1
1,The dress i received is not even the dress on the picture. The dress is horrible and it looks like it's from salvation army and i am not happy at all.,0
3,Too big,0
5,Very comfy,1
5,Cute little dress.  Perfect for everyday wear.,1
3,Love the first order but the reorder was shipped XXL and I ordered XL,0
5,My son's obsessed with these guys,1
4,"My six year old loves this dress.  It's very springy and cheerful.  Our only complaint is that for those kiddos who might be fabric sensitive, it's a bit rough.<br />Washes well and fits true to size.  If you have a tall kiddo, it might be a tad short, depending on the length you're looking for.",1
1,"Thought this was so cute, used the sizing chart to order a medium. It was so tight on my chest and it was so short that my crotch was about an inch from the bottom of the dress. Also, the seam of the top lays directly across your boobs. It was just a terrible design.",0
3,"Make sure you know you're likely going to get ONE random selection from the 3 pins shown.  The picture should make that more clear.<br /><br />Pins should use 2 spikes, One spike just makes it spin upside down or sideways.",0
5,Awesome bag! Great quality!,1
4,"The feel of these are amazing! They are the perfect work from home/lounge type wear. This is my first pair from this company; however I have a couple more pairs from a different company. The largest different in this brand vs the other that I own is the waist band area. It‚Äôs on the thinner side and slides down, the other pairs that I have don‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôll stick to the other brand going forward however; love the color options to select from with this company. Overall definitely recommend!",1
2,"Decent, I guess.",0
3,Love the concept of these but dislikeghe quality of sunglasses,0
3,The bracelet looks cheap..big stones and cheaply made.,0
1,"One earring had missing stone, one stone came out putting earrings on.. I will just wear them until they all fall apart",0
5,"This is gorgeous!  I am a fan of &#34;heart&#34; jewelry and this is done beautifully.  It is simple and elegant.  It is not too small, but large enough to be noticed by admirers.  The silver is beautiful.  This was a wonderful purchase.",1
3,There nice if you have big nipples. I don't so the bar is to long.,0
5,I have bought this amazing üòâ little summer jacket.<br />I absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è them. So soft.,1
5,Iguess my head is off size.  The hat is great,1
2,Worked for a week before starting to break apart. Also the springs that lock it in place will continually pop out since the band is really soft rubber at the end and can't hold them in place.,0
5,My kiddo was recently in therapy and they used these slimmer headphones that he really liked! So we ordered a pair to use for anytime he would need them! Much better than the bulky ones we‚Äôve had for years,1
5,Love! Fits great and yes it lifts where it needs too. Yes I would buy another.,1
4,"These are nice looking when I wear my hair up, or, if you have shorter hair.  With longer length hair all you see is the crystal settings holding the black stones.  Look upscale.  Posts hook to flat plastic backer w/solid metal insert.  Moderately heavy.  Thing is, where the hanging part of earring hooks to the ear lobe post, the eye isn't closed all the way.  Though might not come off, I squeezed that part together on both earrings.  I had that happen with another pair made by same company",1
4,I've really enjoyed wearing these so far. They're very comfy and dressy or casual!,1
5,Love this necklace. It's small and dainty. Just what I was hoping for.,1
1,"While sourcing an original v1 or v2 Casio combi bracelet can be difficult and expensive, the difference is night and day. The springbars that come with this bracelet are so headache-inducing and finnicky it's difficult to put into words.",0
3,Cut fits high under arms. Very uncomfortable.,0
5,Great product. My wife loves them. Well made!!,1
1,"The hat seems fine but the tail was a disappointment, The tail is embarressingly small and short. It looks like it was attached as an afterthought",0
3,Ordered a medium.  Fits loosely and the back does not stay on very well,0
3,Pants were too small,0
5,"In love with this dress! It is so comfortable and versatile, you can literally wear it all day and fall asleep in it at night. Need a lot more of these!",1
3,"The plastic part is cheaply made. Sometimes the nozzles get stuck and it takes some doing to get it unstuck. The glass bottle are beautiful and the nozzles fit well onto the glass. One of the 3 bottles leaks at the nozzle. It works well enough for me, but I recognize that these are not high quality.",0
2,"I didn't expect some high quality material or anything special just a sleeve to cover my tattoos for my job. What's the problem you ask? For one, I'm 5'8, muscular and this did NOT fit my arm at all. Was too tight on my bicep, and too loose on my wrist, they are the same width on both sides of the sleeve, I also ordered a TAN colored sleeve, somehow I ended up with blue. So i can't wear it to work. The lesson I've learned is; you get what you pay for, and if you want something to be a good quality and to last you, don't spend 5 bucks on it.",0
5,"I am 5'4"" 130 pounds and wear a 36B so I was surprised that even the large is a bit snug on me.  I love Patty Boutik and usually get a medium size.  This top is very cute and I love the periwinkle color.  The sweater material is very thin so you can wear it in summer time.  It is clingy but makes you look thin.  Just order up a size or two on this one.",1
2,Run too big,0
2,"The scallops would not stay up on this dress, and I had to return it. Also, the quality of material is not the best.",0
5,Daughter loves it,1
5,The perfect gift to welcome new member into the family!,1
2,The jeans with a boot cut should have a bit of a flare.. these are straight  leg close to skinny... not what I expected..otherwise  they are comfortable  and a good pair of jeans but I wear  boots and these would not go over them if I tried  and would look dumb,0
5,"This shirt is so cute and comfortable, I love it.  I've gotten so many compliments on it when I wear it, and I wear it lots of places besides yoga.",1
5,got these for the wife she loves sparkly earrings its hard to find earrings in a variety like this for this price. she loves them plus she has a few to give to the nieces that absolutely love the as well. these are real shinny and they are a super good deal the wife loves all of them.<br /><br />received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.,1
5,Super beautiful! Looks great on my daughter . Definitely recommend!,1
1,cheap looking has to have small fingers size 6 7,0
5,I love this dress it fits very nicely...,1
1,I hated the dress it was nothing like the picture the shoulders was to puffy it wasnt sexy at all it looked like a dress a dead lady wear to hunt a house,0
2,"Not an over sized shirt. It‚Äôs stretchy so it clings. It is very soft, just not flowing",0
1,I thought the product is poorly made. The wires in the side of the bra is coming out. And the bra clip wasn't sewed in correctly there already coming out. I would not recommend these bras to nobody at all. The only thing I like is the style,0
3,Even after they sent me a bigger one they said would be the right size it was still like 3 sizes to small.,0
1,was incredibly small ... like comically,0
5,"An amazing beautiful watch. I envy my wife wearing it. Even though, I own a collection of beautiful expensive watches, I wish there was a men's version of this watch for me.",1
1,Suit is like something from family dollar,0
2,These were a gift & I was disappointed with the quality,0
5,Great product. Very fashionable and good to see.,1
5,This is my second pair. I liked the first one so well I got a second pair to keep in the car.  With these I don't have to keep taking off the sunglasses and put on my readers in order to read something.  They fit well and have the sunglass on the side also so that it keeps the sun out completely.  Best sunglasses I've had.,1
5,Super cute and versitile.  Throw it on over jeans and a t-shirt and you‚Äôre ‚Äòdressed up‚Äô.  Put it over dressier clothes and you‚Äôre on trend.  Washes well.  The blue color is lighter than I expected for navy but it‚Äôs a very pretty color.,1
3,Bigger than I  expected  nice if you like big jewelry,0
5,Absolutely loved the shirt!  Looked even better in person then online!!,1
3,Chest area loose and needs stichinh and I‚Äôm large breasted.<br />Love color,0
4,"My son loves them, but they're a bit bigger than expected",1
5,"I really like it,  fit perfect and is very comfortable. Great product for the price.",1
5,Although the hoop is thin I liked it because you can use those really small 10 ct golf spacers on. The hoop. Looks really nice & strong enough for its purpose,1
1,"SO the measurements given are 100% not even close to what it says on the design I ordered. I got the small and It says 25in for the waist but it ended up being more like 30in at least....? It's HUGE on me. I wanted to return it and get a smaller size but judging by the way that fit, the XS is not going to be any better given the measurement says it's 24in. SOOOO since it's a hassle to return I am having to tailor it which costs $25 aka more than this actual skirt... Also FYI it has no lining inside it so it's super thin",0
1,Stone fell out after 3 days of wearing!,0
5,PERFECT!!!  Exactly what I wanted.  This will probably become my #1 hat to grab. Great color.  Received in Great condition with more than adequate packaging.,1
1,Runs very small,0
5,"Came packaged beautifully and safely. Have to say I love it! The colors are gorgeous and match my dress perfectly. I know how difficult it is to match colors or coordinate colors when shopping and choosing on line, but this was perfect! I may never shop for silk scarves anywhere else every again! Thank you.",1
5,She loved it,1
5,"This pair of earrings is very easy to wear, as the seller said, very simple and hypoallergenic.",1
5,Great,1
5,"Pretty, light weight and perfectly sized",1
5,"I ADORE this dress!! It‚Äôs only a tad too big. Like it fits really well but I think I could‚Äôve gone one size down! That being said, it‚Äôs super cute and AMAZING quality. The sleeves have little Pom Poms and 3D flowers on them and they‚Äôre adorable.",1
5,The material isn‚Äôt rubbery or tacky like some other silicone bands.,1
3,Too small.<br />Looks good though. Exactly as pictured. Ordering. New size.,0
3,Calidad,0
5,My 8 year old loves these!,1
5,Beautiful!,1
5,Este producto es suave y comodo,1
3,"The description that it is a ""velvet"" bag is false, it is more like velveteen. It is still a nice bag, but it shouldn't be stated that it was velvet. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",0
1,Poor quality,0
5,"The glasses are exactly as described and they are lightweight, comfortable and attractive.  The bonus is that they come with a case and a lens cloth.  At this price, you can afford to have several pairs in different colors and that is exactly what I did!",1
5,Really great quality lapel pin. Fastener fits tight so it doesn't fall off.,1
3,to big for me,0
2,"Heel was not high, there's not much of an arch so it kind of looks like heels men wear. which there's nothing wrong with but I wanted something higher. also there is very little grip on the bottom so you will slide around everywhere and while the heel is comfortable that danger factor made me never wear them. They also look way too big, not like the original style, much bigger so I felt like that red villian from the power puff girls.",0
4,I love this watch! Hooked right on to my purse.I gave a 4 star rating because the stem is a little hard to pull out to set the time.,1
5,These were purchased for my daughter to use at the pool.  I like that there are 2 adjustable straps for a customized fit.,1
3,smaller that expected,0
1,It said one size fits all  What size?  Zero.,0
3,"This sock is very low cut and, therefore, slips off my feet sometimes.",0
5,"Love the top, kinda aggitates a little on one side",1
2,"I ordered my usual size M, but these fit tighter than the black pair I ordered in the same size. Not sure I like the color. It's not a true Navy.  I'm not sure about the material either because it's little too thin. Since these are a little tighter than I wanted, I will return them. Don't love them.",0
1,Got a XL and it was entirely too small. Looked like a Medium.,0
3,Decent band . The leather and the rings are little thinner than I expected but the strap all around it compliments the watch I put it on. The metal is painted and not anodized.,0
1,Great for holding glasses on your head don't fall in water though if so kiss your glasses goodbye as you watch them sink,0
3,For the most part I  like them but the insoles are terrible i had to buy a second pair of insoles,0
1,"I am giving this one star I really don't want to because it's very cute but as I was getting ready today and had my hair put up I noticed that in the back by the neck is a gap about 2 inches that wasn't sewn up to the neckline, I rather fix it myself and buy a little sewing kit even though I hate sewing and I can't see very well than go through the hassle of sending it back then waiting for another one. I wrote the company and asked them if this was a common issue so I am going to wait to hear back from them before I buy the green dress. Like I said it is pretty but I don't think it's right to buy something that has to be repaired and sewn before I can even use it. If it was sewn right I would give 5 stars and order the green one.",0
1,"Loved these at first, but after very little wear on my ‚Äògentle footed‚Äô 7 year old they have both had to be stitched back up on the sides. While they still function it‚Äôs disappointing  that I‚Äôve had to fix them so soon.",0
1,"This product came with a broken zipper. And it‚Äôs also not true to size , I am a size 10-11 and I bought an XL and I couldn‚Äôt even get it over my legs.",0
3,"It‚Äôs a good size and shiny, material looks quality. The size of font for ‚Äúeveryone wishes‚Äù is very small, have to squint to read it.",0
5,We bought this for my daughters pong. It was great! So Funny and adorable.<br />I wish it had buttons or something instead of just elastic strings to tie.but we made it work.,1
1,"Fabric does not look like how it‚Äôs advertised, Weird fitting in the legs and very short.",0
2,"Second time buying this dress from Wellwits. The first (grey) was too tight for its alleged sizing, with no stretch. Had to return. The second (light blue/mint color) came with one button buttoned, and all the other button holes still shut, lots of loose threads, and thin, crumpled material. I'm honestly shocked, as my daily, go-to dress also comes from this seller, Welwits, and it looks like this dress is made by an entirely different organization. NONE of these variations are even near worth the price we paid for this dress. Ick",0
4,"Very cute, but a little longer on me than i was expecting.",1
4,Very comfortable material n color is awesome,1
4,"I really love this bag. However, the snap botton on the exterior pocket is already coming off. I believe the material of the bag cannot sustain the constant opening of the  pocket.",1
5,One - it is absolutely gorgeous!  love the Carolina Blue color!  And two --  it fits my phone and is easy to wear when I don't want to carry my heavy purse!,1
5,Sturdy...nice quality. The rope is soft and strong.,1
1,This is very cheaply made. The design is just on there with ink not embroidered. It shrinks when you wash it,0
5,Not as showmen worthless does not fit,1
4,Very nice good price. Delicate though.,1
3,"I returned it.  It was flimsy.  It did hold my ring, but was not as well made as I was hoping for",0
5,Granddaughter loved it. She plays competitional soccer.,1
3,"Most of my jackets, coats, etc. are XL (the same size as this one was supposed to be) & they all fit well. However, this one is a little bit small & I won't be able to wear it with much more than a T-shirt (but for the price, it's OK).",0
5,Absolutely love these. They were packaged very nice and true to discription. Perfect for my vacation,1
5,"This bracelet is super cute and lightweight.  It arrived in a cute little black bag like shown.  I thought that this bracelet by Kanti Design was so unique from other designers, yet simple.  It paired perfectly with my fit-bit on my left wrist.  The lava stones are rare as others do not have or make them.  The Buddha charm was very intrinsic, yet channels peaceful thoughts when I look at it.  It's simple, unique and charming or any one who loves yoga, spiritual or calming tangible goods.  I received this item at a discount for a honest and unbiased review. This review is honest and my own and based on the product itself.",1
5,This dress is Beautiful as it is on the pics. Bought it to wear to a wedding and it was everything.,1
2,Super uncomfortable. You can‚Äôt keep them on for long. The metal part on the nose is very heavy.,0
4,"Great for my son, fits true to size, shipped quickly!",1
2,Loved the cut and pattern; hated the fabric! Felt like cheap Halloween costume material. Truly bummed because the dress looked fantastic on (5‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô 140 lbs / ordered a size Med).,0
3,"They are pretty, but alas not rose gold but yellow gold plated....  perhaps a wrong box was sent?",0
2,I'm typically a size L and the size L fit me just fine and they are comfy. So why 2 starts only? They are completely see through! HATE HATE HATE that in leggings. Return item,0
1,Garbage don't purchase.,0
2,Do not use the measurements provided by the size chart. This poorly made skirt runs very small for the printed size.,0
4,These are my favorite sunglasses. Fits me perfectly. It doesn't slide down my nose when its hot.,1
3,"I tried to be careful to see that it had a zipper, but it did not, Fine if that is what you want , is a good sweatshirt",0
1,Runs small.,0
5,"I was already buying the white version these socks at a local store and loved them. I just wanted a darker sock in the same style and these are perfect.  They are soft, not too thick or thin.  Toe seam is comfortable and not noticeable when wearing.  I wear these socks for work (I'm a nurse) and for casual wear with my sneakers.  Fruit of the Loom socks are not comfortable for me, but the Hanes are perfect.  Love!",1
3,Fabric was nice but had no give or flexibility. I bought two and were same size. One fit nice in my husbands stomach area and this yellow one was tight. My husband is 37‚Äù waist but tummy is fuller.,0
5,Cute and warm,1
5,Bought these for my teenage boys to carry their stuff. They love the backpack.,1
1,Died after 24 months. Company out of business,0
5,Love this very unique cardigan. Colors are beautiful and fit is great!,1
3,Soft took a day or two to hang and get wrinkles out from shipping bag. A little bigger fit which is go8d for me. Don't like the collar much kind of floppy and wish it had 1 button. But it is warm for cold days and a cute native American pattern.,0
2,I was expecting it to be a much darker green. It is more of a neon green. Still cute but not what I wanted.,0
5,"Very soft acrylic, with great muted colors.  My wife loves it.  Her colors!",1
5,Great !!,1
4,Great color of stones ... clasp needs side jaws .. lost it 3 times and then I bent the clasp and now seems to stay on,1
2,Won‚Äôt stay on. Feels like right size but keeps falling off,0
5,Love it! So pretty and great price,1
5,"Fits great, looks great ! I love the style! I will be rocking this to the office with a nice pair of slacks, and Italian shoes. I will be rocking a fifties European sleek look.",1
3,A bit small and color kind of dull,0
5,"*read in batman's voice* When I escape the delights of the day to bring justice to the people of Gotham, these boxers are the perfect choice. I wear them under my bat suit every night and they have not failed me yet. I recommend this to anyone who wants to save the city they love, in comfort.",1
5,Loved it,1
2,"Very dark as described. However they degrade vision, especially distance. They are NOT mirrorized.",0
1,Too small and too short for a medium I‚Äôm normally a small but bc of the material I bought what I thought was a size up ... it fits like a extra small and short at that my belly almost shows,0
1,Don‚Äôt buy these!!!! Not what the picture of the product looks like. Horrible product!!!!,0
4,My Dr. Who fanatic LOVED them,1
4,"I used these to make bracelets for a son, moon, and stars baby shower.  They were the perfect size for the string bracelet, but within 2-3 weeks of wearing the bracelet the silver polish starts to fade around the tips.",1
1,Very disappointing purchase - does not look or fit anything like in the pics.,0
1,This shrt is no good. Too small. Cheap as they come. And the company listing is a bunch of balony,0
3,"So far, so good!  I need to use it for awhile before I can<br />evaluate it.",0
5,My kids needed ponchos for summer camp. I never ended up using the pants and just donated them. They held up over the summer and I package them away for next summer so they are clearly good quality. But they do run rather large,1
5,"A mi chica le agrado mucho. Ella pesa 115 libras y mide 5‚Äô2‚Äù y el size small le qued√≥ un poco grande, de todas maneras lo utilizo muy feliz de vestir como su marvel favorita!!!‚Ä¶corre un poco grande",1
2,"The material feels cheap, after one wash the shirts has holes in the fabric.",0
3,neutral for me but i didn't love the fit at all...iM super small but i told mi older sister about it & she LOVED it...it fit her amazing so it's not a loose at all to me lol,0
1,made of super soft material.  the little unicorns came off after an hour of wearing them,0
1,These are used! Came in with tiny finger prints and sand all over the lenses. Scratches on frame. These sunglasses were returned and sent back out without reviewing.,0
5,"I love it! The color is incredible on my skin tone. The fit is perfect, snug in all the right places. If you have an hourglass shape, you'll love this.<br />I wouldn't wear it on a hot day (above 74 degrees) as the material has some quality and thickness to it. It's perfect for that perfect sunny day and definitely good for an indoor event on a chilly day. Everyone kept commenting on it as I walked around town.<br />It's great for formal or casual cute situations. The day I wore it, I also found a wall that is the same color! Fate! It was meant to be. It's a great dress!",1
2,"Not super thrilled with these. You definitely get what you pay for with these. The colors were good, but the metal was cheap, used once and the attachments are breaking",0
5,The dress is exactly as listed. Perfect size 8.,1
2,Its a cheap cloak. After the one day it started to come undone. Worked for the day I needed it.,0
3,"This boots are super cute, my daughter loved the style and how comfy they are but after wearing them for a week the heel got separated from the boot itself :(",0
5,"I bought this set for my daughters 16th birthday, and they are beautiful! They are not round however, more like rice pearls, but never the less gorgeous. These are her favorite gift that she recieved, and they look great on her. She wears them all of the time. If you are looking for a great set of pearls, but cannot afford the pricey ones, these are a graet choice. I was a little worried about what I would get, but was pleasently surprised with them.",1
5,"The best,<br />I love it is so much easier than a sweater on a toddler and my son looks so cute!",1
1,Ordered an 8 package marked as 8 when Opened sweater was a 5.  Ordered again waiting to see if same mistake.,0
5,Adorable...granddaughter loved it!!,1
3,"These are cute, but I felt like they were WAY bigger in person than in the picture. I don't wear them because they're so giant.",0
5,Just as described,1
5,I ordered one last Spring. I loved it so much much I ordered one for my sisters too.,1
1,Run very small,0
3,"Cute but big, and the fram was a little off",0
5,Nice swimsuit!,1
5,This blouse looks very flattering on me and I love the wine color which is very true to the product image. My only qualm is that the stitching on the ruching at the bend of the elbow - especially my right sleeve - has become too loose after only 3 washes (I hang dry) and allows the sleeves to hang lower than they should.,1
3,"So cute, but unfortunately runs small/ short in the torso.  I will keep it for my younger daughter to grow into.",0
1,"Cheap, the wire in one ear was broken when it arrived, the tail is not a Pom Pom bunny tail like the picture suggests.  It‚Äôs 2 pieces of lame short ratty looking teddy bear fur down together on elastic that expands to about 19 inches so unless you have been corset training that‚Äôs not going around your waist.<br />I could have and have made better bunny ears by hand.",0
5,"These are my favorite workout pants, snug, comfortable, and breaths keeping you cool.  I love then.",1
5,"These are fantastic! I find every other face mask I have bought to be far too big - this fits perfect on smaller faces. Excellent quality, gorgeous colours. Recommend!",1
5,Perfecto,1
4,"I bought this for my nephew ( hard to shop for teens nowadays). He ended up liking it and but it on right away- he said it sounded good and was comfy, so I guess it was a win!",1
5,My daughter wore thus outfit for pucture day at school and it fit her so well.,1
5,Beautiful necklace.  I love the length.  Just what I wanted.,1
5,Hat is just as described...but I need 3 more in pink if u have them,1
5,Great hat. Fits great and keeps my head warm.,1
3,The bras are very nice and look great on. They fit very nice Except the straps are way to long. Tighten them all the way and still need to be tighten more,0
4,These are so cute. Plan to wear to work. Need a size 3 times bigger for a party.,1
5,"My son wore this in the San Jose area Turkey Trot, a charity fun run - it added a bit of hilarity. He refused to wear the sign I designed to go with it:  Crude letters said &#34;Eat more toikey.&#34;",1
5,Perfect!,1
3,I wanted to give these socks 5 stars because I like that they cover the top portion of your foot so as to not cause chafing with your shoe but they're already falling apart after just a few washes and wears. Two have already developed holes in them.,0
1,Item broke within two days.,0
4,Just upset cause it didnt come with the belt.,1
1,"Belt wasn't really flattering on me, I wasn't really sure what to wear this shirt with.",0
5,"Works very well.  Keeps hair off of kid while allowing air to circulate under it.  If you've ever used the plastic cape in a home shaver kit, you know that it really makes you sweat.  Highly recommend it.",1
2,Thought the dress would be more EXTRA. It looked like a regular black tube dress nothing special. Plus it fitted looser than expected. I usually wear a small could've went with a extra small.,0
1,"I gave this necklace only 1 star because of the poor quality of the chain. The chain has no real clasp, it is the chain you find on a dog tag that kids get from the 25¬¢ candy machines or on a Key Chain. It isn't long enough to just slide over your head so you'll need someone to put it on for you. Don't bu",0
5,My son loves it. Plays with it every day.,1
5,Love the colors and the fit is great!,1
5,This is an awesome sweatshirt and my kid gets compliments every time he wears it.,1
5,Great buy Great purse,1
5,Amazing I love em,1
5,Great,1
2,Very disappointed. I've been trying to find one that has all these heating areas. Thought I found the one. Even double checked the measurements before ordering. Ordered a 2X fit like a medium or large.,0
3,I really like the luggage. The larger one was a little harder to push smoothly. The other thing is it scratched up pretty easy after one use.,0
4,"What I expected.  The picture show and description show extra long but these go up to right below the knee, which is what I wanted. I like them because they are not really thick and I can wear them with slacks for work in summer and not be too hot.",1
1,Ordered this an a XXL but maybe would have fitted a regular L. Jack Wolfskin sizing is horrible!!,0
1,Not well made,0
4,"Arrived on time, no damage to the clothing and it fits. Only problem is that when i take the jacket off theres this black stuff that sticks onto every shirt i wear which i find annoying but is easy to remove.",1
1,Not dependable,0
5,"I loved everything about this dress! Fits as expected, large. I am 12-14 ladies size. Material was stretchy. Didn't wrinkle. Great for the price!",1
5,"We ordered the 5'0"" model, the photo shows a black/grey color scheme however upon arrival we were surprised that it's red/yellow/orange/black.  Now, for the 5'0"" board this is the correct item and the black/grey model is the 5'4"".  Just a heads up, the design and colors are still cool just surprised that it didn't match the description.",1
5,I love these sets,1
5,Ladies don't hesitate to purchase outfit. Very good quality,1
1,Color was exact but the dress was too big. I had to return it.,0
3,Dress very nice. Runs small.,0
4,"The costume is great! I'm usually a small but the crotch area was very tight so I had to size up. Medium fits well, the material is just very stretchy so I have a bit of extra room in the torso. It's very true to the pictures, but i will say the crown/tiara/headpiece makes the costume look very cheap and Halloween. If you're wanting this as a cosplay, definitely plan to purchase a separate headpiece.",1
3,"I usually fit into a large and decided to order an XL just in case! I was very disappointed, seeing as all of the other reviews guaranteed a good fit, to find that I could barely zip the skirt up. Other than the sizing, it is a very beautiful skirt.",0
3,"Goes with my seatcovers and similar material. However my 15"" wheel is easy fit.. almost too easy. Rubber inside slid easily. After a few days it seems to have stuck better. A friend suggested I sew it on and this can be done easily if it continues to slide.",0
5,"If you are looking for a great fit in yoga Capris, these fit perfect and feel great on you!! I would wear them 7 days a week if I could.",1
1,They made my ears infected! I paid extra for 2 day shipping because I needed them then they didnt even work!!! DONT BUY they are pink not skin and the flare is really big. dont waste your time.,0
4,"Good item, nice look on my gear watch!",1
3,Cheap material stains easily.,0
5,very comfortable,1
4,A little thin but the price was not bad,1
1,"This is NOT a sweatshirt.  When I requested a return they offered me a different size, but it wasn't just the size that was a problem.  I didn't like the whole shirt because it says sweatshirt, and it isn't.  It's very thin cheap material.  I won't buy from this seller again.  No refunds given either apparently.  Haven't heard from them since I requested a refund and return.",0
5,"This has a nice selection of pearl-look earrings. The largest size is not huge, so these are practical and wearable. I will say the photo was not quite a perfect match - in the largest size, my package had a pair of the deep red instead of the fuchsia pink. Better for me anyway. The dark brown in the largest size is not very pearlescent, more like just dark brown studs, but still fine. Other reviewers have mentioned not getting enough backs - my package had plenty, but they are separate. There are clear silicone ones and also metal butterfly backs.  Overall great value for the price, and lots of useful colors as well as neutral white.",1
5,Omg these were perfect for our rodeo kick off this Past weekend in Houston. I got so many compliments and no one had my outfit! Get these!!!,1
2,The fit was ok I am upset because the price went down four days after I ordered it,0
2,"In the picture this dress has a v-neck, the one I recieved has a very round neck.",0
5,I took a chance on these glasses after looking at Ray Ban which are the glasses I already own. I have to say the Anglers are wonderful. They block out all the UV light and they frames are very light. I am able to place them over my face mask and they stay put even if they are slightly off my face. Love them and thrilled about how much money I saved.,1
1,It did not work,0
2,Segun es xL y esta demasiado peque√±o ese es como una talla s,0
5,Beautiful!  Very happy with this purchase! Extra rhinestones 'just in case'.,1
1,"The measurements are HORRIBLE., I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 180 and I wear a l/xl I ordered the 3x because I wanted a baggy fit and it fits like it‚Äôs a large‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I barely got it past my thighs smh",0
4,Not board short material it's more like a reg swim bottom. I'll wear them but not what I was wanting.,1
5,"The color, lavender, is beautiful. Would recommend and purchase again in o/colors.",1
4,Great socks! Love the design.  Not as comfortable as other compression socks I own but work well.,1
1,"Man, I wish that were true to size but noooooo!",0
1,Dress was wrong color and way too big.,0
5,"These are not fleece lined, like I'd read in the description or if they are, they are not hot. I bought them hoping they weren't fleece since they didn't look it in the picture and was happy to see they weren't. Absolutely love the color and pockets, my large phone fits well and makes working out easier since I don't have to wear the awkward arm band",1
5,compact but well built,1
5,"Item was as described. Would buy again. Great quality and lightweight.  Compact yet able to fit all vital sign equipment,  wound care supplies, tablet and ppe equipment.",1
1,"All 4 arrived broken . Some with decals scratched off, one with key ring broken off. They are flat plastic with a decal. Not worth sending back.",0
4,I really like these earrings and they‚Äôre very well made but they are quite a bit smaller than I was expecting.,1
2,waist was large everywhere else fits.  The picture on the model does not show that the back. The back crosses all the way to the waist.  I was thinking that it crossed up higher like most overalls. I do wish the buckles were on also.  Just like the other reviews.  The button holes are a bit smeal and we had to cut them.  We have a defected buckle. I hope they can send me a spare.  I will see. It was shipped from china.,0
1,Very cheaply made. Sent wrong size.,0
5,Keeps great time very reasonably priced,1
5,REALLY nice - wife loves them and they look great on her.,1
5,This backpack is amazing. I can fit all my stuff in with no issues. This a stylish every day use backpack. The padding is comfy and breathable. I like it.,1
3,So tiny. Fit for a 5 year old or younger child.,0
5,I haver a large head and it if perfectly!,1
4,"They are perfect. The elastic in the back doesnt look as great as in the photo, but its ok.",1
3,"To tight around ears.  Top rim does not shield eyes from sun. Other than that, these are great.",0
1,Very thin. Not something I would wear as a work attire like they show in the pictures,0
3,"Sadly my dress arrived later than expected, so I was unable to wear it for the occasion I hoped. I would have kept it, however it was too big and the top looked dirty. Not sure if it just got dirty in the packaging or what. Still good quality and customer service was great. I would buy again, but a different color and smaller size.",0
3,Too gold,0
4,Cute dress! Can't wait to wear it!,1
5,"Very comfortable.  Fits well.  Can easily be dressed, up with nice sweater",1
4,This is a very nice watch but the bracelet is really cheap kind of feels and looks like tin. I brought a new bracelet for $35 and now it looks like a nice expensive watch. The way the bracelet is made is also a huge pain in the butt to remove.,1
5,Fits well. Received many compliments when wearing this suit. Comfy and makes you feel good.,1
5,Great. Light weight. Going to purchase another pair,1
1,Terrible quality for the price they ask. Dingy looking and I would recommend sizing at least 2 up. This ripped instantly when I put it on. I would rate this zero stars if I could. What a disappointment for the the amount of money I paid.,0
3,"Little small in the shorts. If you work out and have very muscular quads/thighs, these are not the shorts for you! I got the white top with the little plaid shorts. Shorts have zero stretch like some of the other colors",0
5,Stunning little girls dress!,1
4,Super cute!! And fits well,1
5,Nice glasses especially for the price.  Bought as a gift and recipient loved them!,1
5,"I ordered this dress for a bridal shower. It's really pretty. Other reviewers have not stated that this comes with a hidden zipper at the side, and transparent removable bra straps. It runs small but i just followed the size chart... with little room for stretch. For reference i am 5'4&#34; 125. 35-26-36 and i ordered a medium. I usually wear a small for dresses. Medium fit perfectly. Definitely size up! A little snug at the top but i think this is good so that the dress stays up. A little bit more nude than pink, which i actually prefer, and the material is very heavy. I will post pics soon!",1
5,Very stylish and well made. Goes great with my Carrera.,1
5,These came quickly and are the same great feel of all lularoe leggings,1
3,"I liked them, they are what was expected from the pictures. HOWEVER, I lost two within the first week of wearing them. I was water skiing and pulled it out when I wiped my nose to get water out and the other time I'm not sure how I lost it but I think it was through out the morning. They just slip in and out too easy, I don't know if that has to do with the bend or the length of the pin. They look great and I love them otherwise. I still wear them but usually don't leave them in for extended periods of time because I can't rely on them staying in.",0
5,"Just what I ordered, and arrived in time for the luau! Good length. Smelled strange upon opening, but that dissipated shortly after airing.",1
4,"These look great, beautiful colors, lots of variety. Only concern is we bought a 00g, and the description says 00g, but it‚Äôs definitely smaller than a standard 00g, they‚Äôre more like a 0g.",1
5,Very good product,1
3,"Only got to use it once....the clasps started to change colour after the first use. Then again...for that price, I wouldn't expect anything else.",0
5,"Received many compliments at a 1920s theme party.  Sequins are plastic and well sewn on which I like because they don't scratch up leather car seats.  Low V back requires proper brassiere;perfect length dress is right below knee with long fringe that hangs right above ankle. Size XL, 165 pounds, 5'6"".  Best price and additional  accesories pack was perfect . Very pleased for the occasion.  Wore once and would recommend dry cleaning to preserve or hand wash.",1
4,Overall the product was really nice. Packaged very nicely and was given two additional bands to put on if needed. Kept the Apple Watch dry when submerged in water. Only downfall was that it is pretty big on my wrist. Which made my hand a little uncomfortable.,1
3,"I am 5'3' and the length is perfect for me with the foldover. Washed them and they shrank very little in length and not at all at the waist. Ordered and XL because the were out of L, which is my size, so of coarse the are a little big. They are very comfy and I do like them. A little pricey though.",0
2,Too small and not enough grip in the snow. I returned them.,0
2,Cute design and very soft.  My son absolutely loves it.  The low review is because we've only had it for about two weeks and it has a large hole in it where the hood attaches to the robe.  Should be better quality for the price.,0
5,I am a loyal buyer of this watch. I am in the third purchase and I prepare for the next one.,1
3,"This is such a cute, comfy, and flattering dress, but I had to return it because it is SO SHORT.  I'm 5'7&#34; with a long torso and normally wear a size 2, ao I tried a small and a medium.  The small was obscene - all my lady parts were on display when I raised my arms.The medium was a little better, but still obviously made for someone much shorter than me.  The mall hit about 6-8 in above my knee, the med about 4-6in.",0
4,Snug fit.,1
3,"Ordered this in plain pink, size L. I have a 36D bust and it was a little tight at the top of my chest, just enough to ‚Äútent.‚Äù Quality was good, but between the fit issue and color, I decided to return it. The plain pink made me feel older and almost as if I was wearing scrubs.",0
3,Pretty but runs small for a one size fits all top. Definitely a small size to maybe medium. No larger.,0
5,Very comfortable,1
2,The watch itself is great. It was exactly what I was looking for but the band is horrible. Maybe I received a defective one but the pins that attach the clasp to the band popped out literally out of the box. I glued it back in and the next day another pin popped out. I may keep the watch if I can find an decent band to fit it otherwise it‚Äôs going into the trash.,0
5,So pretty!,1
5,"Nice item, fast shipping",1
5,Fits great.  Love them.,1
5,"THe most understated pair off cufflinks that I own, but they are so beautiful they take your breath away.",1
3,These are super cute and looked fairly well made but they run super small. Ordered a size larger for my teens and they looked so small I didn‚Äôt even bother giving them to them.,0
1,"This product wasn't that expensive, but it didn't even last two days. The top of the necklace was bent when it arrived in the mail. My girlfriend just wanted another necklace to wear now and again. I understand this wasn't high priced jewelery, but I expect the craftsmanship to be better regardless of how much the item is.",0
3,I like the design but i feel it‚Äôs too long especially for a small design. Also since the chain is too long it does tangle a bit more. Wish the chain would be a bit thicker for the length or the charm larger,0
1,"I loved these glasses until I wore them to the beach. After my day in the ocean, the glasses are ruined and I can't see out of them. I guess it serves me right for buying cheap sunglasses.",0
5,so much in love with my frames I liked them so much I put my prescription in them.,1
5,Great buy!  Perfect to wear in hot or cold weather.  Will definitely purchase more.,1
1,solo me lleg√≥ una correa y eran 5 o al menos eso dec√≠a lo que YO ped√≠ a√∫n sigo en la espera de las otras 4 que faltan,0
1,"Material looked damaged, and the bust pads were floating all around and came folded in half, the top was ill fitting, gaping at the sides, I am a 38C and bought a Large, Where the top and waist met it was too small. Did not look like picture, terrible material. Do not bother I have never tried on a bathing suit that felt like this.",0
2,"Review provided by spouse:<br /><br />I am disappointed in this sweater. It is very very wide, but not long at all. The color is a yellow/cream color as opposed to white. It‚Äôs see through, so you would probably need to wear a cami underneath. I love the whole oversized look that‚Äôs popular today, but these dimensions are just off.  Unfortunately I have to just give it 2 stars, but others might like it better depending on your cut preferences.",0
1,It didn‚Äôt look like the picture shown so I had to send it back,0
1,"Bought for gift to friend, but ended up putting in corner of my desk. Look too cheap to give it to someone. Unless you don't care and want to just watch for yourself then get it. Otherwise you probably find better watch at local beauty store.",0
5,Very nice feel and quality leather.  Looks cool and use it for driving provides good grip on cold steering wheel.  Bought at super sale price so completely happy with these posh fingerless gloves.,1
2,My waist size is 24 inch.<br />But X-Small is too big.<br />Waist band is nessasry but I don't pants like this weird size,0
5,Fits well. Would be nice to have a variety of back ground colors.,1
5,Wow!!! Just wow!!! I cannot believe I got all these super cute earrings for so cheap!!!. They a bohemian and are smaller than pictured but so cute!!! So happy with this purchase.,1
4,"I returned for a size down.  I am a wide 7.5/8  (depends on style and maker) - but 7.5 was way to large. 7 is good. I love the asymmetrical toe line - makes the shoe more formal, necessary for people like me who can't wear heels. It won't last very long, I think, but great for the price and the event.",1
4,"Overall nice products. I like the butterfly the most, though there is an accidental scratch on one top (hard to see it unless get close enough). Btw, the star might be way too small. Recommend.",1
1,I wanted to like this because I love leopard print and I saw several bloggers share about it.  Upon arrival it was ill fitting and the sizing is way off.  It was way too big.  The lace didn‚Äôt align correctly on the shirt either.  I‚Äôd recommend skipping this one.,0
5,fit great. Does shrink a little in the dryer tho! I love them so much I bought the gray ones too!,1
5,"Great product! Roomy and organized so so well,thank you!",1
4,cool,1
1,Don‚Äôt buy this it was so loose straps very very funky I returned it,0
4,I fodnt give 5 stars due to the umbrella flipping up when it was windy. All is all its sturdy and I like it.,1
5,Love the look!! These shoes are great. They fit as expected and feel great,1
4,I love the product but the color was not as pictured.,1
1,"Bought 2 of these for my 4-year-old twin girls for ballet class. Fit is very cute. They find them to be comfortable.<br /><br />However, one of the leotards fell apart with 10 minutes of wearing (not exaggerating). The skirt separated from the body of the leotard.<br /><br />Also, with both leotards, it should be noted that the shiny dots are actually STICKERS‚Äîthey are not printed on the fabric. They come off quite of bit during wear. It‚Äôs unfortunately just a very cheaply made garment.<br /><br />I would have returned these but ballet class starts too soon and we don‚Äôt have time to wait for a replacement.",0
4,nice for layering it is light weight but not too sheer.,1
5,"Working from home indefinitely now, I'm constantly on the hunt for a comfy bra with no wires that doesn't look bad in public for those few essential trips a month. This is very nice, fabric is silky and light yet gives a nice hold. I like that the padding is removable and in one piece (I have a few with two pads that I just can't seem to get right again after washing). Purchased XL for 38DD and it fits JUST right. I don't think a larger bust would work. The support is good for light workouts such as yoga or an elliptical. I wish there were more colours!",1
3,Good fit but the kids were not able to run around our wooden floors without slipping and falling. The bottom of shoe has no grip and is not anti slip.,0
5,Very pretty.  Exactly what I was hoping for. They appear to be the same size. Have great sparkle.  They also came with a certificate of authenticity. I purchased them for my second hole .50 cttw.,1
5,I have a hard time at 62 holding cards for pinochle.  These holders work great!  Yes I would recommend them.,1
3,"the color was not as described; it was much more red than expected; wanted the pink/fuschia color; also ordered one with purple and black, but what came was totally white!",0
5,"Love this dress.  very cute and comfortable. Pair with tights, long scarf and boots and all set for anywhere!",1
5,It is a very nice and simple dress just the way I like it.,1
2,Inexpensive little piece...,0
5,"Perfect fitting, product arrived on time.",1
2,Bought these for my wife - she loves them.  recommend this product,0
5,I got the rose gold color and I love it! Its super pretty and looks like it cost a lot more than $15. I love the closure with the bead slider-I am always playing with it. Adds an interesting touch,1
5,A lot nicer than i assumed it would be great feel ect,1
2,I like the product but it came ripped so my boob was out I am returning and trying for a new one,0
5,I loved it üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,1
5,nice,1
5,"I wasn't expecting much from these sunglasses given how cheap they were.  However, they surpassed all expectations! They have a nice weight to them and don't feel cheap. They came in a case which was helpful.  I don't take very good care of my sunglasses which is why I prefer to buy cheap ones.  I would definitely purchase these again and again.",1
2,"Feels more like a cheap fleece. Fabric is awful. 80% polyester. Everything else is great, length & fit.",0
5,Great,1
2,"Not really well made, but I wasn't expecting much.",0
5,Was great amazed me when I opened the box. The colors in this watch was eye popping. My grand daughter is going to be very happy.,1
4,This runs a little big,1
1,This is a kid size not womens. The listing is deceiving. This is a 5-8 years old size bag pack for school. I am returning it.,0
1,"Way too big, looks fake",0
1,"My lanyard had tearing in different spots. I‚Äôd return it, but it‚Äôd be a waste of time for an $8 item. They should inspect an item before shipping.",0
2,Doesn‚Äôt fit as expected,0
3,"Saw this shirt on someone else and thought it was so cute, but I have a larger chest size (36 DD) and it just felt a snag too tight, and the material didn‚Äôt sit correctly because of my larger breasts. The material wasn‚Äôt too bad (not see through) and I love the tie in the back/backless effect. Sad I have to return this.",0
4,"A good quality product, except that they should use a better zipper.  I like it collarless and sleeveless, so I can wear it for longer time without wash and it is not in the way while I do housework.  I gave it 4 stars because I suspect that it is not made of lambswool.",1
4,"I like that it came in different lengths, and that it has the little magnets on both sides, for picking up metal items. The longer trigger is very good too, for a more comfortable grip on the tool, and when it's holding something as we draw the object nearer, for us to grab. We also like the folding and locking aspect, for easy storage. It's a bit bulky at the bottom, which is my only concern.",1
4,"These joggers look fantastic and fit great, but don't wear them on a hot summer day - they're made out of 70s track-suit material and get really hot. Otherwise awesome. Zip pockets.",1
1,Cheap looking material but cute print,0
5,This earring is better looking in person than the picture shows. I would definitely recommend this seller to everyone. Great product and super fast delivery.,1
4,Very cute but some of the feathers came off,1
1,"Very cute colors, material feels very nice and they look really cute but the orange is completely see through. I tried them on and I could see my entire butt crack through them. Very disappointing!!",0
3,Don‚Äôt darken at all,0
5,looks real nice on my pandora bracelet,1
3,SUPER CUTE pj's but they run a bit small.,0
3,"This is a really well made hat.  Unfortunately with my big head and thick hair, I feel like it slips up and won't stay on in a breeze.",0
5,My mother loved this hat and wears it often. She has a small size head and was concerned that it would not fit but it does and she looks nice in it. Ordering her 4 more,1
1,The stocking was to small and I need to return.,0
1,Already broke CHINA junk !!!!!,0
4,"I absolutely love the feel, the look, and buttons.  However, they are mostly made for small Asian men with shorter arms.  I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and have longer arms.  They come up a little short on the sleeve.  Other than this, it‚Äôs a must have in the cardigan closet!",1
3,"Pretty, more for a coin purse than anything else...looks good but not very practical for everyday use...doesn't hold very much",0
1,"This dress was awful and after I returned it I got charged a $4 restocking fee. Ridiculous, I do not recommend purchasing at all.",0
3,"no es de muy buena calidad el material, el bolsillo vino roto",0
1,"These earrings are horrible! And to make it worse, they do not allow returns. They don‚Äôt look like the phot and are not worth what they cost. Do not purchase these!!!!",0
2,The product arrived with a hole in the arm sleeve on the seam near the armpit.  I was disappointed because the dress was exactly what I was looking for with length and color.  I posted that it fit as expected but I didn't try it on.  I held it up to check the length and noticed the hole so I packaged it back up to return.,0
2,"I absolutely love this bathing suit - it fits perfectly and it's comfortable.  However, after only 3 wearing a, the shoulder straps fell off on one side. I'm so disappointed. It's so hard to find a bathing suit that is comfortable and stylish.",0
3,Too tight.,0
5,Really pretty earrings,1
5,Arrived fast and as expected,1
3,I had to have several links removed and it still feels a bit heavy and bulky for my taste.,0
5,"I work in healthcare and I was looking for a headband that will stay on my head. I have tried many throughout the years and with COVID-19 I added some buttons , I have to wear a mask all day, and these are so comfy, no pressure on your head.  Well worth it.",1
5,"Perfect size, cute. Arrived very quickly.",1
1,This looked nothing like the picture.  I hate the dress.  It makes me look pregnant.,0
2,I love this shirt but it is wayyyy too wide.,0
5,"Great product! Pop in the frames easily, and they work great. They arrived about a week earlier than expected and they come with a microfiber bag for your sunglasses. The gold color is a little deceiving from the stock photos as they are shiney rather than matte but I really can't complain. I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
5,"Love the fit , so comfy .",1
1,Wore for 5 secs before the dots on the mesh started falling off.,0
5,I ordered this for my Halloween costume and the quality is way better than what I expected. I half expected it to feel like a cheap costume but my husband wants me to wear it again. I usually order XL in things because I want them to be looser. I‚Äôm so glad I went with the large. It fits loose in all the places I don‚Äôt want attention drawn to. Both pieces are of a stretchy material so you don‚Äôt feel constricted either. There was a couple snags in a couple of the embroidery flowers but all in all happy with my decision.,1
1,Doesn't fit at all.My eyes were smashed down by upper lens and the rubber is very generic and sticky.Also all the air still gets in your eyes.,0
5,I'm impressed with this!! Protects my watch all the way around. Would be great if they had more colors to chose from. But overall I'm happy with the purchase. And would definitely recommend this to anyone.,1
3,I returned these. Quality seemed ok but fit was horrible. X-large would not fit over palm area of my hand. If you have very long fingers and a very narrow hands these are for you. Also are more like light weight gloves than Glover liners.,0
3,"Dress is pretty! However the bust had two cups sewn on with two little strings on each side, making it not functional. Might as well not have cups. It has a corset back so you need help to put it on. It is very long but I considered getting it tailored because it is such an original and beautiful gown. However at 70 for the dress and another 40-80 to alter it, wasn't worth it to me. I hope they start making these in petites.",0
3,"The watch was nice, but smaller then anticipated. Would have kept it other then the fact it didn't fit my wrist and came with no extra links.",0
3,Just ok.  Great price but not a great shirt.,0
5,"so very pretty,just like a carribean ocean",1
3,You get what you pay for. They're just ok.,0
5,"It‚Äôs an ok mask. I find the inside vent stops my glasses from fogging.<br />Price is steep, but ok for me.",1
5,Very comfortable. Nice soft material and has a little padding in it which I really liked.,1
5,I am a professional carpet cleaner and this time of year when it rains often and snows in between i am beyond happy with these shoes. My feet stay warm and dry.. Having to walk to my work van has become less stressful knowing that my feet will stay dry and this has helped me from getting sick..,1
5,"This cap is simply amazing. It is carefully crafted of genuine materials, no junk. The leather looks and feels great. The lining covers the entire inside of the cap and it is very warm without making you sweat. This is an investment in your warmth and wellbeing. One note on sizing, be sure to order at least one size larger. I measured 60mm and ordered the XXL (62mm) which is still just the tiniest bit snug, though not uncomfortable by any means. The only issue is having the patience required to wait for the cap to arrive.  They are all shipped from Poland very promptly, but will still take a week or two be delivered. If you want a classic look that honestly keeps you warm, get one of these.",1
2,Very thin and cheaply made. A lot smaller then I expected,0
1,It came to me broke,0
2,Should have bought a size up. This dress is pretty tight. Bodycon like fit.,0
5,"I love this shirt!! It completely sums up my life üôÉ<br />It's a good quality shirt, will last for many years",1
2,"Four pleated ends/corners stick up. Size is fine but loose against cheeks. Great patterns, great material, needs to have better control on the corners to stay against face. My suggestion would be to have elastic go inside through material like curtain rod.",0
5,"Very comfortable, soft, true to size. Love them",1
1,The top half is bigger and bottom is tapered off giving it a weird shape. It looks odd and the mesh that goes over the bottom half is poor quality and sewing is terrible!,0
1,I had to return these pants because they were huge! They were wide like balloon pants. I did not try to order the smaller size.,0
4,The color is nice,1
1,Much larger than expected. The ball doesn‚Äôt stay on very well.. big waste of money,0
5,Every time I were these cufflinks I get compliments. Thinking about buying a second pair in case I lose the first.,1
5,The shirt fits a little larger than expected the art work is excellent.,1
2,"Got a free hair tie in the package which is adorable. However, the shirt itself is nothing like the images. It's a cheap, plain t-shirt material and looks it. Looks kind of gross and cheap if I'm honest, like a yucky, ugly t shirt someone's already worn to the gym. There's literally no texture to the shirt, super cheap, not soft at all material, it's nothing like the images. Really disappointed because I only ordered the shirt because I fell in love with the images.",0
5,Nice,1
5,It is just what I was looking for....thank you,1
5,my granddaughter love them,1
5,Super cute purse for my daughter!,1
5,Excellent quality at a very reasonable price.,1
5,Another great mask for the teen that likes to laugh and see the humor in difficult situations. Fits good. Has a place for filters which is great for extra layering.,1
5,"These jeans were a gift for my grandson which he absolutely loved! They were a little too long but he rolled them up and made a cuff,  he was fine with them!",1
5,work great,1
5,"This is a nice addition from kipling! Its not too large, but it offers great organization for cables and charges",1
5,It‚Äôs absolutely perfect I love it,1
1,Not USA sizing,0
5,"So cute and of good quality. They are thick enough to have structure and not be see-through which is a plus because I want to wear these out!<br /><br />I am ~5ft8, 116 pounds - I most often wear a size small but had to order these in an XS because the S shorts were a little baggy.",1
5,Great,1
5,"I like this dress, the material is lovely and fits nicely.",1
1,The description said it would fit a big head and gave a measurement and it turned out to be smaller than described. I cut it and modified it so I am using it but big headed people should measure your head and contact the seller before ordering. Great quality hat just a little too small for me.,0
1,I recieved the merchandise and the clasp was broken so I returned it.,0
5,"Finally found the ""leather"" leggings that I have been looking for! Lined on the inside, not hot material, doesn't sound like a plastic bag when you walk, a little stretch, holds EVERYTHING in, SOOOO flattering, perfect length! Did have slight smell, but after leaving out overnight to air, the smell was gone. LOVE these so much!!!",1
5,"1.) The cap fits good. 2.) The ""US Air Force"" and ""Retired"" prints on the cap are rather.",1
1,"IT WAS TOO BIG, RETURNED IT.",0
5,Great product!,1
1,Feel apart before ever wearing I went to try it on and the strap broke so I was irritated but would‚Äôve worked with that and then the large facial piece came off it goes back on but just keeps coming off like maybe it should be glued and wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôm really not sure I will add photos so u can see not sure if we got a bad one or if there all bad but honestly first impression was a huge bust and wouldn‚Äôt recommend off that I‚Äôd return if it was something that wasn‚Äôt worn on our faces,0
1,"Nice earing, cute and good quality. It doesn't fit the ear as the picture shows. The tail is not anywhere long enough nor is it designed to hook onto the ear. Disappointed because that is why I bought it. I ended up just using it as a pin & sticking it on my purse.",0
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this necklace. I was worried it would look cheap or different from the picture, but it looks great. It is a heavier necklace, so expect that. But love and would buy again.",1
1,"YAZILIND Jewelry LTD, I had a lot of problems with them.  They use Tibetan silver which is harmful to humans.  Look it up.",0
5,Very warm.  Fits good.,1
1,Fell apart while wearing it for the first time. Don't waste you money.,0
1,"This absolutely does NOT go to size 16!  There is not a marking for size 16 and it is NOT wide enough for size 16.  False advertising and a lack of photographs to see if it has size 16.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a set of mandrels that cover sizes 4 to 24.  The smaller mandrels go to size 15 and the larger mandrels start at 16.  No overlap; no coverage for size 15 to 16.  Somebody in the industry dropped the ball!<br /><br />I don't care how well made a product is, if it isn't as stated, then it fails.",0
2,I will only wear this around the house not in public...,0
5,I like it because it has a sleeve to put the stems of your glasses in.  My others have had a rubber holder and they were always moving.,1
3,"Socks are a lot heavier, thicker material than I expected.  Glad I bought the large, because according to the size chart I should take a medium, but I don't know if I'd be able to get those on.  They are a tight fit.",0
5,"I loved this. The controller is about 1 1/4"" wide & 1 1/4 "" high. It's solid . I combined this with an angel circle keychain to give to my 16yr. He's getting his permit.",1
5,I love this dress.  It is comfortable and falls just right.  I have received several compliments on this dress,1
1,"I received this item on time and it is good quality, however, I didn't get the items noted as they were listed in the grouping.  I contacted the seller who was very apologetic and offered substitutions.  I was initially impressed with the customer service.  I sent in my list of missing items and substitutions for the one unavailable item.  They indicated they would ship them.  After a little while of not seeing anything, I contacted them again.  They responded that they forgot, understandable for Christmas season and I didn't need it until a spring birthday.  They were going to ship right away.  Now, months later, my contact to them gets the response that the order is over 90 days old.  Repeated emails over the last two weeks go without response.  I am very disappointed in what I thought was a great find.  At this point, if the order is corrected as promised early on, I would still use this seller because the items are very cute and good value.  I will update my review for final resolution.",0
1,Pocket placement is right on the hip.  Very unflattering!,0
1,Wallet broke within the first week I got it.,0
2,Looks nice but is made cheap compared to authentic ones ive had before. Should be cheaper and will end up leaving a stain on your skin from the cheap metal its made if when wet.,0
4,Good.,1
5,The perfect answer when I just don't want to wear a full compression sock.,1
1,This is the OLDER style of the bag.  It has since been updated with an adjustable strap and a magnet closing.  I returned it because I wanted those new features.,0
3,"The purple on the screen is much richer than the color of the actual shirt. Also the sleeves are not flowy. I returned it because it just looked too matronly with the sleeves sticking to my arms. It's hard to describe, but it's mini pleated and causes static cling.",0
5,"My husband is not a slipper kind of guy, but he really likes these, because they have an arch support and they are adjustable. He has only had them since Christmas, but they seem to be good quality.",1

5,"Came fast, like the tee shirt.",1
2,"The bag was super cute and the perfect size for carrying an iPad and a few necessary items for a day of workshops. However, by my second round of workshops the zipper had broken off.  Kinda disappointed that the zipper didn‚Äôt last more than a month.",0
1,"As soon as I put it on, the elastic on the sleeve broke. Completely fell apart. Not worth buying.",0
1,"This is the second time I've purchased this bracelet. The first one was too small. My bad. This one seemed to be a better fit but defective. After delivery and opening for the first time, it would not close all the way. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I'll stick with the real Pandora from now on.",0
1,"Sending this sweater back. It‚Äôs someehing I could purchase at Walmart for $10.  The material is cheap, and it looks nothing like the photos. Very disappointed.",0
2,This is the 2nd time I have purchased and both my normal size and the size up was too small. Hopefully 2 sizes up fits!,0
3,"Got this swim top and it was too small, had to return it.",0
1,"I really liked the look of these earrings but they are too thick for the holes in my ear....I have never had a problem like this before, I could get them through using a vasoline product but they were too uncomfortable to wear.",0
2,"Shipping is fast but, the only problem is the material. Is 100% polyester and not cotton. Do runs a little small. I order an XL and it fits like a M-L. But sinces is super stretchy and tight you might be lucky.",0
1,Bad,0
1,Not in the shape I wanted it to be in.,0
1,"These pants are terrible. They were supposed to be high waisted, but they are far from it.",0
4,"Ok. These pants are cute, stylish, and comfortable! I will say the sizing is really weird tho. I ordered these in the black, and the light blue, I normally wear a medium. Which I ordered the blue in (and I thought the black too)‚Ä¶They fit perfectly. But the black they sent me in an XL which also fit perfectly. So either the black runs smaller than the blue or they mislabeled the black pants ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
1,The dress was so cheaply made and the fabric so cheap feeling and looking my daughter didn‚Äôt even try it on. We just returned it.  Didn‚Äôt expect much for the price but it failed to reach the low bar I had set.,0
5,I received this skirt size L üòâ early and am as happy as possible about that. I according to the scale at Publix weigh 220 I'm 5&#34;8 with a medium bottom and a 36 inch waist. When I tried the skirt on it sat about 5 inches below my bust which makes the skirt a highwaisted skirt. The skirt is very elegantly made soft and flowy exactly as pictured and I could of gotten away with a medium. The skirt is very long and drapes a little long and because I am a afraid of ripping it with my heels and tripping over it I will need to trim it a little. Thank you for this affordable fashion statement and for reading my review. üëå,1
2,"These are not suede as described. They are a thin, shiny cloth that stretches and the ‚Äúleather‚Äù trim is just plastic. They look pretty, but are not what is described and I am returning them because they are not warm and also not worth the price.",0
5,"My husband is a very heavy sleeper. Multiple LOUD alarm clocks have a tough time waking him up. The Shock Clock gets him up with no problem and is quiet enough that it usually doesn‚Äôt disturb me. A few helpful suggestions:<br />1. Turn the alarm off mode to jumping jacks. This forces you to do jumping jacks to get the Shock clock to shut off.<br />2. Wear the Shock clock so the module is on the underside of your wrist. This is much more sensitive than the top side so the Shock is much more effective.<br />3. Make sure the wrist strap is tight enough. A loose wrist strap results in a weaker Shock.<br />4. Put a zip tie on the clasp so you can‚Äôt simply take it off and go back to sleep. My husband has to do jumping jacks, then go find the scissors to cut the zip tie. After all that, he is pretty much awake.<br />Great product. Would, and have recommended to others.",1
1,"Very breakable, not flexible and hurt my ear. Sorry, it's a no-go.",0
5,High fives all around! Merica!,1
5,This was a great swimsuit cover up! Fit well and good quality fabric.,1
1,The frame was bent when I opened the package and they sit crooked on my face.,0

5,"This was purchased by my wife. It‚Äôs not as bright as it seems in the photo - there‚Äôs more pink to it as well. Still, she says it‚Äôs cute & she gets compliments on it all the time although I don‚Äôt like it LOL I know she‚Äôs wanting to order some of the other varieties available.",1
3,"The y are very lightweight. (Quality is ok). Kind of large on face. Wish they were a little smaller, but for the price I'll keep them!",0
3,"It's smaller than I expected, but subtle is better.  I think it makes a better statement that way, too.  Clever gift idea for the bicycle enthusiast.",0
3,they are cute but poor quality,0
3,This is not a tank top. It is a sleeveless shirt. If it was an actual tank top it would be perfect.,0
5,"I love this dress!  So comfortable and the fabric is thick enough for my bra not to show through. I'm 5'2, 135 lbs and the Small fits perfectly.  I bought it in teal, washed it, color stayed true, so bought 3 additional colors.",1
5,Great option for costumes that require gloves.  These give you the look while freeing up your fingers.,1
5,"vision is too narrow- too hard for me to get used to. The higher power part works well, but the mid range and far range, not so much- i personally need bifocals i guess so that the peripheral range isn't restricted. I'll give it a 5 star because they do what they are supposed to, but i personally can't wear them",1
4,"great  glove just to small,  will send back",1
5,"Great Item, make's Apple watch look nice designer watch.",1
3,After one wash they unraveled  but it is soft and comfy,0
2,Thought I was getting 6 pair only received 1 pair but since they were too large I guess it worked out.<br />I have 34 inch inseam & size 13 boot and these came over my knees.,0
3,It‚Äôs a good idea. But the fit of the charging attachment isn‚Äôt right. Had to struggle to get it attached to the sunglasses. The frame is Soprano. Not sure if it works for other models...,0

5,So cute. Worth it. The extra piece made her dress stand out.,1
5,I bought one in black and loved it so much I bought a second one in blue!!!  Lots of storage spaces and holds its shape.  (The last purse I purchased just collapsed when it was set down.),1
3,"Tight in the chest, I‚Äôm a 36D",0
2,"While it is pretty, t he leather is very thick, but the prongs are very delicate, no support at all.  Makes it very hard to actually buckle the belt.",0
3,"This was a really cute dress, but it was way too short for a tall woman. I'm 5'11 and ordered the size large. It fit great at the shoulders, bust and waist, but it needed a few inches in the sleeve and hem length.",0
3,This is a little snug getting it over your head. Also a little too snug across the face. Would be nice if it was an inch or so bigger around.,0
1,"Don't make the same mistake I did...call the phone number on the sweatshirt bf you decide to buy...that's all I'm saying! When my 11& 13 year old wanted to call the number, boy were we shocked. Very inappropriate",0
1,"Cheaply made...there are much better gloves out there for this purpose.  I would not recommend these at all.  You get what you pay for, I suppose.",0
3,"The navy color is good. It was difficult to put on my watch. The strap is stiff rubber, it isn‚Äôt flexible so it‚Äôs constantly sliding out from the 2 loops that are supposed to hold it in place. I had purchased a Seidel watch with a rubber strap it was soft and pliable, but the loop‚Äôs ripped easily. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this strap/band.",0
4,"good quality, nice hardware, long enough",1
5,I love that these socks have that piece in the back that keeps them from being eaten by the shoe. I‚Äôve bought them twice and they are the only socks I‚Äôll wear now.,1
3,"It's OK,  had to assemble it. I ordered one with chicken on door. I received a star on the door mounted upside down!  Not sure how to rate it?",0

1,Tried to remove it but can't without messing up the shoe! Really love them tho that was my only issue these are coach shoe and they ain't cheep so they should not come with anything on them I'm asking for half of my money back please thank you!,0
2,Ripped in only 2 wears cheap boxers,0
3,Nice material and captions were clever,0
1,Sized too small. My little one is in a 10. Ordered 12. Too small.,0
3,An interesting style but did not look right on me. Came in a box with accessories but the frame itself is a little on the flimsy side.,0
5,Very small but cute. Not what I expected. Looks like a toy bracelet but it's growing on me :O) .,1
1,Washed it before use and my son‚Äôs drool made the blue dye run. It also stained a nearby blanket. He was sucking on his foot and the dye came off. Extremely concerned about my son ingesting the dye. Do not purchase.,0
2,I should have paid attention to the details before I ordered 2 of them. The seams are on the outside which makes the shirt look sloppy.<br />On a better note the fabric is soft and the colors are nice.,0
4,"This dress was great for a wedding. It was loose and flowy but didn‚Äôt look like a paper bag. It really is super flattering on the waist, I didn‚Äôt get a good picture because I was holding my baby the whole time but it looks great on. When I first got it, I was still nursing and couldn‚Äôt wear it because wayyy too much cleavage. Now that I‚Äôm not nursing, it fit perfect in the chest- I‚Äôm normally a 34 DD. I still wore a cami underneath to bring it up a bit because I am quite modest but overall it worked!",1
5,"Comfortable, breathable, and stay up well, with no irritating bunching or bothersome seams. These socks are not overly thick, but they fit just right for most uses and so far, have laundered well. I would recommend them to friends.",1
5,Very nice great value,1
5,I gave it to my daughter and she loved it.,1
3,"Cute, but can't be worn alone. It seems like it would be or should be sold in a pack of bangles.",0
3,"Super cute, but they are kind of heavy. They should have been given a hook rather than a post because the backing is just a rubber stopper and is not enough to hold the heavy earring in the ear. I will be using metal backings from other post earrings with these. Also, the ones I received are silver, not gold like the picture. I don't care so much about the metal color for these so it's fine, but if you have your heart set on gold know you may not receive that color.",0
3,"First pin came with the back spikes completely bent and a small chip off of the paint in the front. The second one they sent to replace was better, but I'm going to be gentle with it because it appears that it might damage easily.",0
5,Super cute! My daughter loves it. She‚Äôs tall so the purse strap is great.,1
5,"Me tard√© en descifrar el amarre, pero me encant√≥.",1
5,Looks like a high quality shirt that you'd find at a nice boutique. The detailing on the white lacey fabric is beautiful. I got it in white and its not see through! I can't wait to wear it out. I will say that it runs a little bit on the big side so buy true to size or size down. Great quality for the price!,1
3,I am usually a small or extra small. This fit like a womens medium I would say. Thought it was worth a shot but if you are tiny it won't fit. Also very very thin material,0
5,I bought it for the pendant,1
5,"I got this bag not expecting too much. For the price, it couldn't be any good, right?? Wrong. It's not too shabby. It's a nice size. Very roomy. Lined. Outside pocket. Inside pockets. Shoulder strap... Construction is not too bad. I mean, really, under $10. Can't be beat. What's even better, if it would get stained or in some way damaged, I won't lose any sleep over it. It's a nice shade of orange. Not too red, not too Halloween. The only thing that I wish was different is the lining. It's very dark brown which makes the inside a bit of a black hole when trying to find something. A lighter shade might have been nicer, but again, under $10... I am not using this to haul around any type of electronics. If you want to use it for electronics, I suggest you get some type of protective case for your device.",1
4,"I like that this Faja makes it easy for you to do everything in it without limit however if you are pear shaped, having thicker than normal thighs may cause pinching. Otherwise great faja.",1
5,My wife lost her all black Skagen and they no longer offer the same model.  This was the closet we could find to that.  Not as small or thin but she is quite happy with it.,1

5,great scarves. The colors are really nice and the students live to use them during remote learning,1
4,"We used this to make my son‚Äôs assassin snow fox costume. It was great.  The mask fit great, was comfortable, and easy to wear. It was super cute and tied his costume together.",1
1,Cheap cheap cheap material. Worst Amazon clothes purchase ever. Buyer beware!!!,0
5,I got the wrong size because Russia sizes are smaller so I would recommend getting one size up,1
3,"I bought this for my maternity clients to go along with a bandeau top and to really show off that belly, I ordered a medium thinking that it would be the average female size and it was a stretchy material so I figured it would fit nicely on the women I photograph.  Well when this arrived, I actually tried it on first to see how it fit because it felt pretty small.  I was definitely right, this skirt was tiny, I am a small person so it did fit me but it was tight and it definitely won't fit anyone bigger than me.  The other problem I had was that the material is extremely see through, even wearing white underwear/shorts underneath you can see everything.  I am going to try and alter it to fit the girls and then just fix the transparency in post processing.  But I wouldn't recommend this skirt, it looks beautiful on the product photo but isn't quite the quality you expect.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

4,"Cute bodysuit, would definitely suggest ordering a size up though, not for the fit of the top but for the bottom, it's just slightly too short. For reference I'm 5'3 113lbs and usually wear a small",1
5,Love it!!!,1
5,I could not find my daughter's size locally and these were perfect.  She loves them.,1
1,"I bought this to custom dye for a client. It‚Äôs advertised as rayon spandex, and the tag reflects the same. However I thought it felt and acted a little strange, and sure enough, when I dyed it, it wouldn‚Äôt take the fiber reactive dye, which proves it‚Äôs a man made fiber, not a natural one. Now I‚Äôm out the expense of my time and materials, but at least they refunded the purchase price. I have to find another one my customer likes the style of, and her order will be horribly delayed. Shame, because it was nicely sewn.  Not the seller‚Äôs fault, but the seller‚Äôs buyer needs to be made aware that they are mis-labeled.",0
2,"First positives: material is lightweight, appears sort of perforated, best use for active wear.<br /><br />Negatives: sizing is far off base.  I ordered XL per their sizing recommendations.  XL fit closer to 2XL or 3XL.  I can't even fathom what size would correlate with XL.  There is no indication the shirt was made slim, after trying it on.  You might as well wear a dress.",0
1,It extremely uncomfortable.  Like a neck brace. I returned it.,0
3,"I really wanted to love this. I am 5‚Äô10‚Äô‚Äô and 130lbs. I usually wear a small, but ordered a medium based on the reviews saying it runs small. The medium was way too small length-wise. To get it up over my shoulders I had to stretch it. This make it lose all of the drape it‚Äôs supposed to have and made the waist sit in a weird spot. But even the. The crotch was super uncomfortably tight. In addition to that I found the fabric to be quite itchy. I showed it to my sister because she‚Äôs just shorter than I am. It looked super cute on her (she‚Äôs 5‚Äô4‚Äô‚Äô 120lbs). So she kept it even though the itchy fabric is annoying she‚Äôs going to make it work.",0
2,Much Smaller than expected.,0
3,I have to say the coloring of the rings are inconsistent to that of the characters of the show and the metal parts that hold your figer look a bit dented as if they were toiled with but all in all I think they're cool still for cosplay. I mean a little change in color does seem cool if you really think about it :),0
5,"it will keep the sun off my face a, neck and ears from may thru october.",1
3,Nice. Bought 3 as presents for my girlfriends daughters they liked them very much.,0
2,Buyer beware - this product is BYOB. You have to bring your own baby.,0
1,"This suit looked way better in the photo. It's got a small waistband, but a really large blouse top. Kinda looked like a grandma suit and the color was more blue than the picture looked.",0
1,Loved the papillon dogs on the socks but my wife ended giving them to my 3 year old granddaughter because they were very short,0
1,"Got these last night and two have already broken. They both broke immediately after putting them on.<br /><br />The first one got magnetized to my watch clasp as I draped it over my neck and when I pulled it free the tassel came out and stayed attached to the magnet. The second one I put it on this afternoon, then picked up the laundry basket to take down stairs.  When it set down the basket the medallion was detached and laying on the ground. So disappointed! üò©üò≠<br /><br />These were very gentle activities. The quality is very poor if they both broke within the first minute of putting them on.",0
1,"bought it for a gift and wish I hadn't.  The dress looks super cute in the picture but is a sack in real life.  Not flattering, the fabric is not comfortable and feels like cheap fashion, not recommended.",0
5,"This oil container is much bigger than I expected. However , the price was cheaper than store. Glad I purchased it.",1
5,the pants fitted perfect the zac & rachel brand are some of the best that I have had the fit and the materials are just right.I am very pleased with the service and would order again from this company. thank you,1
5,Adorable though a little big for the head of a newborn but fits great over a newborn hat.,1
5,"Classic black pillbox, nice quality & construction.  Enough veil to cover eyes even if worn further back on the head.  Little brooch adds a nice touch, but can be removed easily.",1
5,Well made & a good size. I love it.,1
5,"My husband loves his jacket. He‚Äôs able to fit things in his pocket that normally would be bulky, but to his surprise everything fit into the pockets he doesn‚Äôt look bulky and best of all he‚Äôs hands free to fish and enjoy kayaking.<br /><br />Thank you.",1
2,Polyester flimsy material. Comfortable fit but not a quality product at all. Fit true to size. I will keep the pants but will never buy another pair.,0
5,Good case the inside clashes colorwise but it was cheap and protects the phone. Thanks,1
5,"I‚Äôm not a purse person, but this is the best bag, holds my phone, my credit cards, pen and paper. That‚Äôs all I need, and it‚Äôs purple, my favorite color",1

5,Great !  especially for flat feet!!,1
5,"So excited to have this T-shirt nightgown. It is so soft and comfy and the colors were just as shown. I bought my mine up one size as I wanted it a little loose and it worked out perfect. It is nice to be able to come home from a full day, put this on and lounge around the house. It is not see through, but is light weight. I would not hesitate to even answer the door in it if needed. Mine came just above my knees and I'm 5' 7&#34; tall.<br /><br />Update: I liked this so well I ordered a second one! So comfy!<br /><br />If this review helped you, please click Yes below. Thank you!",1
2,Very tiny. Maybe made for a child's rist?,0
1,"Fit is terrible, the legs are fine but it's too loose at the waist (yes I know it's a stretch-waist, but even this is too much). The button came right off within 30 minutes of wearing which definitely made it an awkward work day for me. I would not recommend.",0
1,Ordered a 2 was sent a 10. Had to return and decided to order a different suit. This one was really cute but I didn't want to have to send it back again.,0

2,Didn't come close to fitting,0
4,"Purchased the burgundy/red and Love the vivid beautiful color. Was happy they were soft and comfortable to wear, but due to the fact they are a women's fit, they run a little small.

When we had an issue with the band giving out unexpectedly, Speidel stood behind their product and resolved our problem thoroughly. Will definitely be sticking with this brand in the future.",1
3,"These lenses are indeed polarized and also fit perfectly in the existing frame.  However, the lenses themselves are thin and feel very cheap compared to the lenses they are replacing.  In the end, is it worth the money? That is debatable. I would feel less like this if the pricepoint were a little lower.",0
2,"I am not very impressed with these sunglasses, they are way too small. I think this would be better suited for someone with a very thin face. I would return these but I only spent $7.00 on them so it's not worth the trouble.<br />When these glasses came, there are no scratches on them and it come in a black pouch.<br />Don't think I will be ordering this again unless it was for someone else. Oh well, live and learn.",0

5,I love my Mickey Mouse watch. The only problem I have with it is that I have small wrists and this band is too big. It's down to the smallest and is still too big. Otherwise a very good buy.,1

1,"*UPDATE* I gave it a chance and after setting it on my counter the back popped off. When attempting to put it back on, it crumbled like tissue paper. I would suggest you never do business with this seller again. Pure garbage.<br /><br />It looks ok and meets the aesthetic standard I want. However, it randomly stopped functioning within 24 hours. It can't be that hard to put a decent battery in a watch.",0
5,"Beautiful, charming, classy stud earrings. look like pierced ears!  the clear plastic clip is very delicate so wearer needs to be very gentle when trying to place the earring on the earlobe because the plastic could crack. I found them comfortable but haven‚Äôt worn them for a lengthy amount of time yet. I wish the earrings came with official paper stating that it is Swarovski crystal.",1
1,"The belts were not a woman's XL. The one star relates to the sizing of the belt. I was very pleased with the delivery and how quickly the merchandise arrived, just unhappy with the fact that it didn't fit. It seemed to be an Xl for a child and not an adult woman. Thank you.",0
2,"To start the belt at a distance looks fine but it‚Äôs not accurate at all. For one all the pieces seem to be just glued to their respective plates and there was a lot of scratches, chips and dents on mine it‚Äôs not great but if your just cosplaying or something it‚Äôs fine but not good as a display piece or as a replica.",0
1,Product stitching caused item to burst when soaked.,0

4,"I ordered these boots to go hunting this fall with my husband. They are sized for men, and seem to be true to size. I wear a 9.5 in women's and have a wide foot. I ordered a size 8 and they fit great. They aren't too heavy. They don't have a lot of cushion on the inside, but okay if you wear good socks. They would not be good in extreme cold or snow, but okay for cooler temps and Fall weather. These seems to be good boots at a really low price. I was pleasantly surprised.",1

4,My son loves his face wrap mask. They came with filters to insert into them but when we inserted it in to use it for his appointment the filter allowed the mask to not work properly. It rode up or down depending on the movement. We don't use the filters but he still loves the wrap as it is easier than putting a mask on his ears and the strings breaking constantly.,1
5,"I bought these to so I'd have a nice looking carry bag when gifting a casserole, but have found other uses for them. They make great bags for shopping and even storing extra socks. Do note that they are pretty thin, so I wouldn't suggest carrying really heavy items. Great value for the price!",1
2,Fit was wrong,0
3,Very limited directions in English. Did not remove smell from wristband,0
5,Y'all they're so dang comfortable,1
5,Perfect!!!,1
5,Love the comfort,1
5,I bought two.....one for my son and his girlfriend. They loved them!,1
5,My wife has about 20 pairs of ipanemas.<br />All she wears,1
1,I have ordered this dress twice and both times I received the wrong adult size. My daughters size was correct. Mine was not. I am going to try one more time to get the right size. I think it will be cute if I can get the right one.,0
1,Popped,0
4,"I bought these for my niece. She‚Äôs 3yo and unfortunately the masks were too large for her, HOWEVER, they are exactly what I was looking for - comfortable around the ears and super cute. They‚Äôre just not for small kids. I bought a similar set for my nephew (he‚Äôs 7) and they fit him perfectly.",1
5,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  It's my new favorite dress!  I'm 5&#34;2 and 157lbs...I just had a baby, so I have a lot of extra in my mid section.  I ordered a Medium and it's perfect!  Hides all of my problem areas while looking super cute!  Who doesn't love pockets??",1
5,"Love this dress, fits good - feels good, and not too long.  Nice when you are 5' 1"" to not have it drag the floor!!",1
1,This dress was dirty and it was missing sequences. Eww.,0
5,"Nice shirt. My father really liked it. Shipping was fast. I ordered the wrong, my fault, and they were great to exchange the shirts for me.",1
5,"Awesome, high quality belt and buckle. I love it",1
5,Excellent as always,1
5,I bought these as a gift for my mom and she loved them. Exactly like the picture. I will be ordering more in the future.,1
2,I like the stretchy part but the buckle digs and rubs.,0
3,Would give more stars but this photo isn't what I got. Mine is a darker blue with a dark pink. Would have preferred to get the colors I ordered.,0
5,All was fine,1
5,Comfortable,1
5,I like the look of this ring slash bracelet.  If only it were easier to put on.  I have to have my daughter help me with the clasp.,1
2,Too small.,0
5,So helpful,1
5,"No complaints what so ever. I bought this top in a medium, I'm 5'2, 170lbs but very busty. This top is perfect!",1
1,"After very little usage of this belt, one of the pins completely fell out of the buckle assembly and became lost.  This caused the belt to come loose and fail to function while being worn!!  Reliability of this belt is EXTREMELY suspect. I still have multiple old belts from other belt manufacturers that have held up for many, many years.  I wanted to try a 'click' belt which offered some more freedom to click to perfect length, but this belt didnt even last a couple months!!<br /><br />I guess I have to go back to traditional style belts which offer RELIABILITY and wont FAIL to work while being worn.  This issue could have become very EMBARRASSING had this occurred in an important social setting or during a meeting/presentation at my job!!!!!",0
4,Nice but it looks more like a man's than a women's.  Chain is extremely long.,1
1,Discolored into brass after a couple of weeks. Very disappointing,0
2,"So I bought this dress in green after buying in in black and LOVING IT. Both fit the same and are nice, but the black one is made from a lovely cotton fabric and the green is this awful,  cheap polyester that reminds me of swimsuit material. And it's not even a deep green like in the photos, it's more of a bright green (which I might like if it weren't for the gross fabric)<br />I still like the way it fits, but I'm returning it.",0
4,Super cute and fits my daughter great.,1
3,"I had high hopes for these socks. I only wear merino wool socks to help keep my feet from staying damp. I struggle to believe these are actually made from merino wool because they feel nothing like any of my other socks, nor do they perform like my other socks. Still, they are fine enough to wear when I need this type of sock so they'll do. Won't likely buy again.",0
1,This costume runs very small. I suggest sizing up as I was not able to wear the vest because it was so tight and made from material that does not stretch.,0
2,These boots seemed to be okay quality until today when my daughter wore them for the third time. One of the handles fell off! I guess I got what I paid for.,0
5,"Loved the bright colors, great quality product.",1
5,These masks fit very well for a man or women.  They stay in place and it is easy to breathe even with the filters.  I also like the ear adjustments.  I would recommend these masks to anyone.  They also wash well.,1
3,The fabric is rather a faded black than a deep black. The skirt doesn't drape as nicely as I'd thought it would.,0
3,"The hat would be great if it fit. I did not realize when I ordered the only available size was small. The app accepted my order without me inputting a size. It figured since the only size available was small, then small it would be. on something as important as size the system should never auto populate the size selection. Force an order to specify a size before accepting the order. It is what happens when capturing the sale is more important than making sure it is right.",0
5,These glasses are of excellent quality. And I can read street signs at night now. I love that they came in their own soft drawstring bag.,1
1,"Very disappointed.  The dress description is ""red"", but the dress I received is ""rust"" color.  I will be sending it back.  The coffee color dress is very nice!  So try that one instead of ""red"" one.",0
1,The metal clasp closing system digs into the skin,0
1,Cheap polyester garbage,0
1,"Fits very small, cheap fabric as priced",0
3,Super cute but runs small.,0
3,The set runs small.,0
3,"Beautiful but kinda small for your face, they fit my 12 year old a lot better.",0
5,"Good quality, nice color brown, confortable to walk. I recomend 100%",1
3,The dress looks nice but in person the print is blah.,0
1,Me mandaron el numero equivocado,0
5,"These little angels are adorable. and there is a great variety of them. I used them for a group of ladies, and they<br />loved them. I put them on a 22' necklace (chain) and they are adorable. Not too small at all, they are just right. I also like that they are easy to use for any jewelry item, or any little project. Give them a try, you will love them.",1
4,This is super comfy. I ordered one in black but the top is a little see-through so I have to wear a tank underneath it. Otherwise it‚Äôs great.,1
5,"[[VIDEOID:366da65f054f0fa8796d9a2524f6e3d2]] Giftable, comes in clear durable plastic packaging, easily wrappable. Great variety,  just as seen in product pictures in Amazon description. Can't wait to add these jibbitz to jazz up plain crocs.  These would also be good for party favors and/or to put in Halloween gift bags.",1
1,Received item broke !,0
1,"Terrible quality, this is the junk jewelry of junk jewelry. Center piece was missing altogether on one. Perhaps I didn't look but the thing were enormous which only added to the cheesy;ness",0
5,"This umbrella is awesome.Compact. Fairly lightweight. Very portable.  I love the push button open, so simple and easy, you can open it quickly in the rain with one hand! Nice colour, too. If I experience problems, I will update my review. So far so good.",1
5,Love It,1
4,liked everything,1
5,Very pretty,1
2,"this bracelet is NOT rubber.  It is faux leather (P.U.) and the black coloring is peeling off of it after 1 month.  if it was really made of rubber, this would not happen.  The closure is also easily opened and I have watched this bracelet fly off my wrist several times",0
3,Too big but still love it,0
4,"A gift from the grandkids in my dads favorite color. The material wasn't what I expected, but at that price I wouldn't expect too much. It does what it says fits his head and will keep a little chill off.",1
1,Too small and returned it.,0
5,Perfect for my 5 year old daughters Halloween costume (French Artist),1
5,"Soft, large scarf that is vibrant and a great value for the $. Shipping was much faster than expected, which was a plus.",1
3,I have a shoe repair shop and thought these may be of interest.  Not really the best we've bought they are only OK and will do if nothing else in our stock is quite right.,0
5,i love them! warm and cute socks.,1
3,"The neck need adjustment,  other then that, it's great.",0
2,Daughter prefers a sturdy cotton feel.  These just don't seem like they'll last very long.,0
5,"A striking shirt. I love the A&E television series and had to have the shirt. I will miss the series when it ends, but I will have the shirt to remind me of it.",1
5,Good value...Fast shipping...Well packed...Will buy again when needed...,1
4,"They are fun and they are cheap. AND...they are polarized! I expect that if I rough-house them that they will scratch or chip. So, I'll treat them gently and get my money's worth. Then I'll order more!",1
5,Lover these.  Want more colors,1
1,"All I can say is that they were pretty. Did not stay up on my arms, slipping down within minutes. I would never recommend.",0
5,"nice closet staple.  I'm between a small and medium, chose to size up to medium for a looser fit. for reference, I'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34b.",1
3,You get what you pay for. These are cheap and clumsy. $1 store quality.,0
3,"I like these. I needed them for postpartum swelling. But, my nurse was not a fan. She said it did do much for my feet. They were perfect for my legs though.",0
3,Well the dress is not the exact from the picture but still pretty cute dress.,0
5,Beautiful diamond studs.,1
5,"This watch is not only beautifully crafted. The packaging is also very exquisite, this watch is great, its quality and price are too cheap! ! It  is perfect as a gift and highly recommended!",1
5,Fits perfect! Not too big or small - perfect gift for my fiance!,1
5,"[[VIDEOID:6bb98947e429ba440283d897f3c475b5]] Me agrado todo,",1
1,"I look like two pigs fighting in a blanket. I thought about giving it to my daughter in love because she is 3 sizes smaller than me, but it was not her style.",0
5,"Fits great on my tall 3 year old. Quality of Capezio is always good, I'm a stickler for material weight, and Capezio always hits the mark. Sturdy, but bendy, still comfortable enough for gymnastics and my daughter never complains, as she has done with other cheapo leotards that hurt her because of scratchy stitching.",1
5,Love the length and also the two zippers (short and long). Also like the hood which can be removed.,1
4,"Super cute, simple, and I love the way it looks. Feels sturdy, I received as a gift. It did not come with the little fuzzy puff ball, however. No worries though! Still cute and good for the price.",1
5,The quality was more than expected and the size was exact. I will definitely shop for your specific brand again.,1
5,Loved the material and fit. Looks great too! I have washed it few times already but it still looks brand new. Highly recommend it.,1
1,They arrived used looking with dark black stains all over them. They also look cheap and spray painted.,0
3,Bien pero no tre los pernos,0
5,Very comfortable,1
1,"It showed 3 pairs and I only received 1. A single pair isn't worth $24.99. These boxers run small and don't breathe as well as expected. My 15 year old son says the pouch on the front is irritating because it causes friction all day, especially when he's running track. He says he wishes the fabric over his upper thighs were longer. He is lean and has long legs ans he says he just doesn't like the cut of these.",0
5,nice,1
5,Yup it fits as wxpected love the sweater and the color black is awesome I use it everyday,1
4,Bra was too big...but looks just as shown in the picture.,1
3,more of a neon color than the regular yellow posted.,0
2,Zippers are cheap and come off track very easily. One bag broke after using it once.,0
5,"Good Gloves, enjoy for driving on cold days.",1
4,"I love the colors and how big and easy to read the face is. Reason it got 4 stars is because it was already running when I got it (not sure how long it will last now) and its a bit loud, like I sleep in a super quiet room and have to put it under the clothes pile because I could hear it from across the room (but I'm a little sensitive to noises when sleeping)",1
5,I'm a medium but always have a prob with long tops because of my wide hips that need a large! If I had ordered a large for overall fit it would be much too big thru the shoulders & chest. This Floral Find shirt fits my small/med shoulders but also drapes nicely over my wide hips! Love it!,1
4,Cute,1
5,Beautiful. Classy. I feel confident and can't wait to wear it for my brothers wedding.,1
4,Good Quality would have to use it a lot more before giving a more an accurate review,1
3,"Not sure how I feel about this dress. I read the reviews and checked the size chart and ordered a medium (I usually wear a S or XS), and it sort of fit when I tried it on, but when I actually wore it it seemed off, somehow. It took me awhile to realize it really was just too big, especially in the bodice. I think it didn't quite click at first because of the material, which I like a lot; it's really thick and sort of stretchy. I still like the style of the dress though. I'm thinking of giving the medium to my sister and ordering a small for myself.",0
5,These glasses are exactly as pictures!  They look great and I get tons of compliments on them!,1
3,"Very cute as pictured, size runs small. It is comfortable but would be better if true size.",0
1,Bought this for my wife as it had nice reviews and looked cute. But after wearing it twice the chain broke. She only wore it while going out for an event. It was never worn while bathing or exercising. And none of her chains break like this did. She is very careful with her stuff. Don't  buy this if you want a good necklace that will last. There are better options available.,0
1,"The bullets unscrew, they both got lost fairly quickly.",0
3,"I wore these to a music festival and in less than one day the metallic parts were already peeling off. The shorts were super comfy and cute, but they are really only meant for one time use until the metallic falls off exposing the black fabric underneath.",0
3,Much thinner than I expected. Fits correctly but I expected it to be more...flowy.,0
5,Exactly as pictured! My daughter is going to be Misty Copeland (Firebird) at her schools wax museum and this is perfect for her costume!!,1
4,Beautifully crafted earings! My niece loved them for her 16th birthday Amethyst is her birthstone and she loved the inique design.,1
5,"Love the color of the lenses, the clarity is great! Seem durable not cheaply made.",1
2,"After hours and hours of searching for an umbrella that was made well, would last and had good reviews, I purchased one. I was thrilled when it arrived, boxed nicely and seemed done real professionally. The holding sleeve is great and the umbrella is made very sturdy seeming. Well, I just had a chance to use it yesterday and it failed unfortunately! After 15 minutes a gust of wind blew and turned it inside out (It was not even very windy). I pushed the button like it said and nothing happened. I struggled with trying to get it turned right side in and of course it‚Äôs raining. After some time I got it down for it just to happen again. At this point I gave up and put up my jacket hood and hurried home. Really disappointed... it seemed like a fantastic solution to crummy umbrellas, but it just couldn‚Äôt hold up. Sorry!",0
5,"I got this for my ole lady as a gift.  She loves it.  The fabric is soft,  and it fits her comfortably. She is happy,  so I'm happy with the product.",1
5,Absolutely love these and the jewels havent fallen out! Good quality,1
3,"The shirt was described as a sweatshirt, but it was not. It was a long sleeve light weight shirt. The colts were pretty, but not as bright as they appear.",0
5,Fits even small preteen girls,1
5,Love this hat and wish I wouldn't have waited so long to order one! I have a couple athletic brand ball caps but felt like I needed something a little bigger that wouldn't make my head look so crunched. This hat is perfect and fits great! The adjustable back makes it a good option for men and women. I ordered the black/grey combo...the &#34;black&#34; on the bill looks a little more distressed and is not super dark. Just right! I would definitely recommend this and am already thinking about getting more colors!,1
3,I like the graphics but it was too long,0
5,Not only they are super stylish they are also good quality and the price is fantastic. Lenses are excellent.,1
1,Very cheap looking and came about two sizes to small.. Will either use as a cleaning rag and or give it to a small child to use as it would be a better fit for them.,0
4,My only real issue is how the aquarius symbol looks. But they are as pictured.,1
5,Love this shirt so much! Comfortable fit and it‚Äôs pretty darn cute!,1
3,"This umbrella is pretty. And it seems to protect from the sun. But it is quite flimsy--it doesn't feel very sturdy. I've used it several times already since I got it, in the rain and for sun protection while walking. And in the rain several times I thought it was going to break from a slight rainy wind. I'm in Miami where we get major thunderstorms, and it's definitely not going to survive for long.",0
1,"Wish  handle was longer, once you open it‚Äôs hard to wrap up again.<br />Not happy with this purchase. But will not return.update: this is junk doesn‚Äôt work money thrown away<br />Very disappointed:(update 10-2019<br />It‚Äôs already broken what a piece of junk;(",0
5,"It, fabulous, I agree",1
3,It arrived after the events that I wanted to wear it too and it was a little snug.,0
5,This crown looks really nice.  My wife wore it on Mothers Day.  She loved it.,1
1,All the wires come out doesnt wash well at all. Don't waste your money.,0
5,"Classy elegant sexy and great for work, happy hour and play.",1
4,Soooo cute received many complaints but I broke one trying to stretch it a little.  Should have been a tab bit bigger,1
3,"for the price paid, it was a steal. been wearing it daily and it has held up very well. it however took so long to come, i nearly forgot about it. looks nice from a distance, but up close the rose gold band looks a bit cheap...far too shiny to be real. overall though, a decent deal.",0
3,"I purchased this for a gift, looks beautiful in the picture, the quality for the price is okay, but I wouldn't purchase another",0
1,Too big n thick a band,0
5,This earring was small but fit my upper ear cartilage piercing perfectly. I do think the 10mm would prob be too small for an earlobe. I got the white gold now I think I‚Äôll get the yellow gold. It‚Äôs a simple look that was exactly what I wanted!,1
5,Watch works fine and is what I expected. Thanks.,1
5,I really love this dress!  I got a small because the reviews stated that it runs big. I normally order large. But a small fits perfectly,1
5,I ordered the 6-12 month size for my daughter it is too big but that's to be expected because shes not yet 6 months. I think its absolutely adorable and cant wait for it to fit her.,1
5,I love these sandals. This is my second pair after years of service on the first pair. The new ones look like they might be better yet. My wife also wears this same sandal and loves them.,1
5,Very comfortable; great fit.,1
5,It was very pretty. It will be a gift for teacher appreciation.,1
4,Nice quality for price. Good fit. Don't dry on high heat. The tie is super easy to adjust.,1
3,"These glasses look exactly like the picture. Dark black with a hint of silver. I love the look of them!<br /><br />Sadly, for me, they are big. They do fit well but are larger than my face so I only tried them on once. I do not plan to wear them but they might be exactly what someone else needs.<br /><br />They do seem built well and would last getting outside in the summer.<br /><br />Received from company in exchange for an honest review.",0
2,Bigger than pictured,0
3,I was super excited when I ordered two of the Love necklaces. But the necklaces I received were shorter than how it is shown in the pictures and in the description. I hoped it was just a mix up with one of the chains so I measured both necklaces and the chains were both 21 inches instead of 26 inches. Unfortunately had to return :(,0
3,Wish I could tuck the hood away,0
5,Very nice earrings.  I used them to convert drop earrings into posts.  (I took off the wire and there was a loop I could put the posts into.),1
2,"Cheap, fell apart the first time I wore it.  Got my money back.",0
5,"I love this tote!! The handles are nice and long. Removable/washable linen liner is a plus. Sturdy, large and made with quality materials.  Perfect for going to the farmer's market or toting larger items.",1
3,So it‚Äôs comfortable it‚Äôs warm but the mask stretched out after maybe three uses,0
3,"This is the first time in my almost sixty years that I have ordered a product that has absolutely no English directions on how to use it! I find it quite amusing only because Amazon has given me a good idea on how to use it in their description and information about the product before I decided to try it. Otherwise, I think I would have been livid!",0
5,:),1
5,Fits way better than 2018 hat.,1
3,I bought this ring a year ago. The design is pretty unique and attractive. You won't be wrong with size because the band adjusts easily. I'd love it if the band would be thinner. The thick round band ruins the impression from this ring and makes wearing it uncomfortable. I still wear it occasionally because the ring matches almost any clothes.,0
2,"Not as pretty in person, sleeve ruffle falls oddly over the shoulder.",0
5,All Smiles,1
5,Very nice! Looks perfect üòç,1
3,"Super cute and high quality. BUT very very very small, even for house key. The chain is easily broken and the key hole not much match with key hole. Only suitable for very small keys.",0
2,My daughter refused to wear it after a day or two. She says the fabric is itchy. She is 6 but on the tall side. We purchased a size 10. The length fell just below her knees. It‚Äôs also a little smaller than we expected. So maybe size up depending on how you want it to fit.,0
2,It‚Äôs a super cute bag but falls apart so quickly the bow in the front fell off the second day so not a good buy,0
3,I did not realize how small the Kestrel would be on the hat. It can be covered by the tip of my pinky. The hat looks distressed but is still a decent hat. The Kestrel is just super small and looks like an old style iron on transfer and as mine was put on right over the seam on the hat I am afraid it will peel soon.,0
2,It‚Äôs tight through the middle.,0
3,Tough to put on but is fabulous otherwise.,0
3,The band is difficult to latch.  My husband would never take time so sending back.,0
5,Well made sleeve and delivered early!,1
3,Had i known this was a mini bag i wouldn't have got it. It cost the same as the larger bag. I was surprised to say the least!,0
5,"It‚Äôs always tricky buying jewelry online.  A lot of time it looks better in the photos than it does in real life.  I didn‚Äôt find that to be true with this bracelet - I‚Äôm quite pleased with it.  The leather bands are soft and flexible, allowing the bracelet to lay on your wrist and move naturally if that makes sense - moves with you vs retaining a hard circle around your wrist.  The beads are a nice variety - some wood and some metal that also give it an organic feel.  A couple of the beads have some nice detail and a nice pop of color against the neutral woods and metals.  I love that this could be used for different occasions - either casual, blue jeans days or dressier, out on the town nights.  Probably not so much for formal occasions, but I‚Äôd think anything up to that would be fitting.<br /><br />The clasp seems to hold up well - I was worried that it would catch on things and open itself but I‚Äôve not found that to be the case yet.  It‚Äôs easy to open with one hand and fairly easy to put on with one hand.  The leather seems to be well attached to the clasp, and I‚Äôm interested to see how it fares when I accidentally catch it on something (hasn‚Äôt happened yet).  I gave the leather a little bit of a tug to make sure it was secure, but nothing is the same as randomly catching it on the corner of your mouse tray.  I like that the beads are clamped down and don‚Äôt move about on the leather.<br /><br />If I had one suggestion, it would be to make sure that the clasp mechanism has no sharp edges or points.  Overall, I‚Äôd say this bracelet is very comfortable but occasionally I will ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the inner, corner edge of the clasp just a bit.  It‚Äôs never been to the point of discomfort, and I do tend to be sensitive to things that touch my skin (don‚Äôt get me started on ‚Äútagless‚Äù shirts that moved all the tags to the side seam!), so I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs worth any deduction in my rating, but in the interest of trying to leave a helpful review for the seller, it‚Äôs about the only improvement I could suggest.<br /><br />I‚Äôm pleased with both the comfort, fit and value of this bracelet.<br /><br />I purchased this bracelet at a discounted price in exchange for my honest assessment and review of the product.",1
4,"I like these shorts, light weight and cool to touch and wear. For biking, walking or even watching tv.",1
5,Everything fit well but I didn't get my necklace or stockings which I'm kinda bummed about but other then that everything was ok.,1
5,Super fire! It‚Äôs definitely more cropped than in the photo but it‚Äôs super soft comfy and most of all fits a thick girls arms! A lot of motos on the market you can‚Äôt move in even in the biggest size because the sleeves! This one is perfect tho definitely plus size freindly good quality classic fit and size up!,1
1,"This dress is very thin. You can see right through it, especially in the sun.",0
5,I‚Äôll buy more I love it,1
4,"They were huge and no,small available",1
4,they're cute and came quickly,1
5,"Absolutely love this dress!!!  It‚Äôs made with an excellent quality,looks fabulous on and can be dressed up or down.  Highly recommend this dress",1
5,"This robe is beautiful and so comfortable to wear.  The cotton is light but sturdy and the colors are lovely.  It comes in ""one size"" which will fit most people.  I am small so I just wrap it farther around me.  I love it. It is long so if you are very short you may have to hem it up. Be advised, it came with the tie belt secured inside the sleve.  I am very happy with this purchase.",1
5,Very pretty.,1
4,I divided the charms between my 2 siblings as a Christmas gift. The charms are fun and can be gifted to a wide age range of children.,1
1,"Made for a child, very small. I even bought a size up. Maybe go two sizes up.",0
5,these were purchased for working outside in the summer.  The fit is great and they are very lightweight.  Super comfortable and dry in a flash. Due to the thinness of the material they can be rather revealing.,1
5,Good quality and very comfortable.,1
1,Medium was a tight fit with the built in liner. Sits weird on the waist.,0
5,"I love these socks! The fabric is soft and comfortable. There are non-slip pads, so the socks stay put during activity. They works great with loafers and sneakers. I highly recommend these socks!",1
1,"I just received this jacket today and I‚Äôm very disappointed‚Ä¶ the quality of the jacket seemed way to cheap to be the price it is. The size was a small like I ordered but it was way to big for myself and was basically drowning it in. No pockets at all so that also brings it down for sure, sorry for the bad review but definitely not worth the money to spend on it, having to resend it back‚Ä¶",0
1,The seam on the back broke open after the first wear and gave my 3 year old blisters.,0
3,Runs small.  Thanth runs true to size,0
1,Material too soft,0
1,"The dress I received is not the dress I ordered. The top is lace, the bottom is plain chiffon, there are no cutouts or flower details. It is a completely different dress and it looks like it has been used.",0
1,Ugly shirt. Too short to even wear. Almost like a belly shirt! Awkwardly made.,0
5,Incredibly comfortable sweater! Runs a little larger than I expected so I definitely could‚Äôve sized down. Overall I love it and would buy it again!,1
3,"Love the way they look and they‚Äôre soft as well, however they‚Äôre very loose and don‚Äôt fit neither me or my husband‚Äôs heads well.",0
2,Very unflattering. Totally shapeless.,0
5,It's a great summer dress and fits my petite frame very well.,1
1,Terrible quality. Leather is cheap and flimsy. Pendant fogged up right away. Have had to fix twice already. Strangely sized.<br />Really disappointed in the bracelet.,0
5,These are very pretty can wear casual or with dressing up they actually look very pretty glad I bought them,1
5,"Great buy, helped with some difficult tiny watches that were easy to open but it very difficult to close.",1
2,So I'm giving this shirt a two stars less for the material and fit of the shirt and more for the fact I ordered a large and got a small.<br /><br />The shirt itself is of decent material and is pretty cute. However the sleeves are too sheer if you're trying to wear it to cover tattoos at work. Good for going out though.,0
2,I was in love with these pearl earrings but the backing is so weak that after a few weeks I lost one of the earrings. I'm a student and I don't do any particular activity that would cause them to fall off so it's a bit upsetting for me to pay for the gold pearl earrings and to lose them :(. If you are planning on purchasing them maybe consider a stronger backing.,0
1,Not what I ordered I wanted a belt in the 60-in range this is 71 in which is way too long and not what I wanted and not what I ordered,0
5,These hats were awesome!  Well made and quality material for the price!,1
5,I get tons of compliments on this shirt,1
1,Too small around arms and waist,0
5,Bought these for a clown themed 1st birthday.  My son kept it on the ENTIRE party and boy did we get some adorable pictures :)  All the kids enjoyed playing in them and some of the adults too.  Fit's everyone a little lose but that's better for the kids b/c it's not up in their faces.,1
1,Didn't like it looks too cheap.,0
5,Beautiful necklace. Received many compliments. Much prettier than picture,1
4,"Surprisingly good quality. I was suspicious at first and very happy with purchase.<br />Has a bit of weight to it so may be warm if too hot outside, but looks elegant for a garden party bridal shower I am attending.",1
1,"Sizing is not accurate,  Definitely not made for plus size women.  Bust is extremely small and the bra liner is about the size of a B cup if that.",0
5,Good Product,1
3,Weird fit in the torso. Kinda shapeless like a sack. Need to use a waist belt.,0
1,"It was in a weird shape when it came--basically the opposite bend that you would expect for a bangle bracelet like this (elongated in the wrong direction). I tried to adjust it and it just bend into an awful and asymmetical shape that I can't fit. It also feels too flimsy to keep bending, because I'm afraid I'll break it. I guess it's kind of cute otherwise, but it's all bent up, and I will not be wearing it. Cheap, but still a waste of money.",0
5,"Great swim trunks.  Saving the,m for the warmer weather.  Fit as expected.  Great value.  Cute print",1
5,Love it,1
1,"Soft, stretchy and comfy, but the seams ripped out on one of them after a single wash, before use. All of the other 3 have lose strings hanging out. I don't imagine  getting much use out of them.",0
1,"Huge buckle - way too big for my taste. If you really want people to know you have this belt on, wear it. They will know.",0
4,Very comfortable and I love the pocket on the side.  Only bad thing is they tend to roll down a little bit hen you sit or late down.  I‚Äôd still order again.,1
3,Noise,0
2,Me lleg√≥ roto solo que noe.gusta estar devolviendo las cosas despu√©s que la.compro.,0
5,We needed a book character costume as my son wanted to be Pete the Cat and the Perfect Pizza Party.  This is apron and chef's hat were perfect for him!  It has a nice weight to it and fits him well.,1
2,They didn't help at all. Same glare level as with my regular glasses.,0
3,I love the outfit the material is absolutely wonderful. But the sizing is wrong i ordered a 3x which usually i will thake a 2x but it fit as a large.,0
4,Buckle is a bit flimsy but good otherwise.,1
3,To small for its size..,0
3,But broke very fast on my wedding day,0
1,"Just aweful. I waited a month to get them, just to find that they were nothing more than stretchy cut fabric. They weren't even sewn on the ends to keep them from fraying. They dont even stay in place. What a waste of money and time. Huge disappointment.",0
3,Gave as a gift.  It's a novelty and pleased my son that way.  He said that he has some ideas of where he might wear it.,0
4,Missing a string in the front and will exchange,1
5,This added the perfect touch for my daughter‚Äôs prom dress. It wasn‚Äôt too much like I was afraid of. She can also reuse when she goes anywhere else to spruce up her outfit. Would recommend,1
5,Nice hat,1
1,"On the first wash the picture is worn off. I washed it inside out, and in cold water.",0
5,My favorite ring now!,1
2,"Once or twice a day it either stops or looses time. I have yet figured out how to change the date.<br />Other than that, it is really a good looking watch",0
1,This things are horrible I  throw  then way  my finger hurt they feeel like you have rubber band in ur hand,0
5,Great gift. She loved it!!,1
5,Beautiful color and comfortable dress. Inexpensive as well. May order in other colors.,1
4,Very light weight....extremely clear and sharp visual wise. My only reason for 4 stars being they easily slide off my head due to them being so light.,1
3,Faulty advertising.  Says Korean clothing - actually comes form China.  When ordering Chinese clothes - ALWAYS start out with a 4X if you expect it to fit a US large size.,0
3,very cute but a lot of them came painted very bad. overall messy job. i fixed it up with my own paint.,0
2,"Not a good quality product, stitches weren't straight, the strap was thinner than original.  It fit but wouldn‚Äôt buy it again",0
4,"[[VIDEOID:db01c3b2631112978022059c4fb220ae]] Was great! It fit great, I ordered a small & I‚Äôm 5‚Äù3, 120 lbs. athletic build and this hit all the right curves. I will say thought the material was sorta see through so I had to wear a VERY small nude thong so it wouldn‚Äôt be so obvious and a nude strapless. I would probably order this in a darker color",1
5,"For a smaller necklace, I was shocked at how well it was crafted. It feels very sturdy to the touch, especially the clasp. It also has a nice weight too it. I feel that you can determine the quality of an object by its weight.",1
5,Beautiful.  I love it! Just a great accent to any outfit.,1
5,"Great toe socks!  nice thickness to them too.  I already bought another set and will buy more.  for the price, compared to Ijinji, i would go with these.  i own Injinji and love them, but for two pairs, of those, you can get 6 pairs of these filas.  I use them both with my Vibram and regular shoes.",1
3,"Size says one size fits most.  If you wear M/L in original band that came with watch, this is a tad bit shorter.  Loved it but not comfortable with the idea this could pop open and I could lose my watch.",0
1,Broke before I could even fit it on my glasses,0
3,nice looking but did not hold up well,0
5,Best Hanes product I've worn so far.,1
3,The earrings might work on your ears but thats about it. If you get them to close to each other the backs will magnetize together and the earring comes off.  The septum rings are too big to fit comfortably and the magnets are too weak to hold in place. Try to adjust it even slightly and they will come apart.  The earrings are cute and the packaging is nice but I would skip this one.,0
3,A bit heavy,0
4,"Love my new snake skull! Only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it's missing the rattle, but came with a Keyring so I'm happy! Otherwise definitely a 5 üåü",1
2,"I love these and I loved the look of them, but after the third time wearing them I already at a hole in the crotch area!!  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving them a 2.",0
1,I did not like these glass's<br />they did fit great but the lens were not crystal clear.<br />I was disappointed after purchase but they were returned without any issue's.,0
5,Love their bracelets. Fun but look more expensive than they are. Magnetic clasp very sturdy. Will buy additional ones as gifts. Lots of styles & colors to choose from this manufacturer.,1
3,U get what u pay for....works well for application (van to office),0
2,"I'm normally a 18/20 and this 2XL dress is too small and very tight -- has none of the flow of the item picture. It also tries to keep creeping up in the back and get all breezy on the backside. As for the material, it is very thin and it ever so slightly scratchy... If it fit better and wasn't so tight I could probably get past how itchy it is, but since it is basically saran wrapped to my body, issa no from me. Will be returning this.",0
2,Pretty but breaks easy.  Mine broke the second day.  Cheap plastic.  My replacement came broke in half.  My 3rd broke the next day.  I gave up on this!,0
5,My mom will love them! They are beautiful!,1
1,returning as zipper won't stay up,0
5,"So realistic looking for a cardboard mask. Completely freaked out my kid, who is the biggest Queen fan ever! Love it!",1
1,The pins kept comin out and almost lost my watch,0
1,It doesn‚Äôt even close,0
5,Good material,1
5,Loved it. Great quality. Runs a size small.,1
2,"Loose and cheap material, not a nice snug fit.  Ok if you have an unusually large head",0
2,It‚Äôs my child‚Äôs size but for some reason it‚Äôs big. Not the correct size for him. Need to order one size down.,0
5,"Love these glasses, I wear them regularly and they help make me look great, improve my athletic and sexual performance, and protect my piercing, beautiful eyes.<br /><br />The only downside is that my wife and most other women won‚Äôt stop staring at me and making inappropriate gestures while wearing them. On FreakyFridayz my wife makes me wear them as we make love. Hell, one random woman even said she felt pregnant just making eye contact with me through the crisp yellow lenses wrapped in that aggressive, yet silky smooth, frame.<br /><br />I do feel a bit objectified, especially when the lip licking and hip thrust gestures start. Luckily, I typically wear these while cycling so I can jump back on my bike and take off.<br /><br />Particularly for any guys that need some help with the ladiez, I give these a 12/10 - Highly Recommend.",1
4,I like the top..... on the model.  She must be wearing one that was 2 sizes too big for her to have it long in the sleeve and loose like it is.<br />The one I got is too small and does not have any stretch so really not anything I can wear.  Bummer.,1
5,"LOVE. It is extremely comfortable,Great for my friend‚Äôs birthdayl party!",1
5,Beautiful,1
3,Very long.,0
5,Love the look! Appears more expensive.,1
3,A little smaller than true size,0
4,"I bought this ring for my daughter, she loves it",1
5,This dress is one of those finds that fits so well I have to buy another one in another color/print asap.  Thank you!,1
5,Such a great band for $5 !! I will be buying more.,1
1,Didn‚Äôt like the quality of the dress.,0
3,Arrived early.  Not oversized as I hoped; wanted large frames.,0
1,"Elastic used was too loose and the design is very pretty but because the elastic is too loose, it looks cheap and slides all over your body because the elastic used does not hold the dress in place",0
5,"I like that they came with a case ,cleaning cloth and packed in a nice box.  I purchased for my grandson to wear on a field trip to the zoo",1
1,"Disappointed , cute top though",0
1,Charm and necklaces looked pretty online but were very cheap in person :(<br />Bummed charmed look super pretty,0
3,These work well but the leather or rather pleather is already starting to wear just after 1 wear.,0
5,Fits and fills nice!,1
4,"It's great, excellent fit!",1
2,"Large is on the smaller size ( i'm typically a M-L) and the frontline is too low, so wearing a bra isn't realistic, also getting it off may be a challenge, not easy with the way it's designed. It's cute though. Sending it back because if I upsize it, it will be too big in some areas, especially the front.",0
5,"Bought it for my son so he'd leave mine alone,  now I want to use his. Soft, thick and so comfy warm. Nice robe!",1
2,I am a US size 10-12 so I ordered an XL after reading the reviews.  It's STILL too small!  The actual dress looks NOTHING like the picture on here.  I will keep and pass on to my sister simply because it isn't worth returning.  But do yourself a favor and keep looking; don't order this dress.  Also - I won't order anything again that says it's coming from China- just not worth it.,0
2,I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately it looks like it was made extremely quickly and not too well even the accessories were missing from the piece itself and it felt a little flimsy.,0
5,Love it,1
4,"I really love these pineapples... I am 5'3, waist 26&#34; bust 30A, everything fits fine however the bust is SLIGHTLY too large for me. The small size can definitely accommodate an A and I believe a B cup. If you have a long torso, I have noticed in customer photos, this might not look quite the same, it fit me well in that respect though. There is very light bunching when moving in the mid section but it is hardly noticeable, it could be b/c it fits SLIGHTLY loose on me/ isn't strangling my body (like shapewear or something)",1
2,"These shirts definitely are not true to size, they run small for sure.  I feel like Chris Farley about to flex.",0
4,Comfortable but falls on the larger side. I'm generally a medium and ordered a medium. Sleeves were a bit larger than expected. Still a great design though!,1
3,"Ok for the price.  They are a bit thin and transparent, but I wore them once & hand washed, and so far no runs or tears.",0
1,"[[VIDEOID:a4675d467c9202f19ffc073c2f81c06c]] Only one side in the box, beautiful box, but one side if earring",0
5,"Initially bought to make paracord bracelets and have now wound up using them for all sorts of stuff from repairs on outdoor equipment, to making support accessories on outdoor and enhancements to existing gear. Can take some pressure. Will be buying more and from this seller.",1
4,"Like other reviewers mentioned, you will hear some threads popping when you put these on...but no holes or anything thank goodness. The fabric is a little different...kind of thick (?), not cottony...more like a thick spandex blend. Hard to explain! The waist is small and not extremely stretchy and sort of smaller, so if you are in between sizes I would recommend sizing up for sure, as it shouldn't effect the rest of the fit given the nature of the fabric. That being said, they look awesome on and despite them not being very soft, they are surpisingly comfy. The waist band is big and wide so it tucks in those side rolls pretty decently ;) I would buy again.",1
3,"I purchased both the grey and gold dresses (2).  Normally wear a XL (1X) but this cute little number runs small for my body type.  It's rather tight, short, and little room bust area.  Cute dress and style (not to mention low price), but not a good fit for me.  Not the dress' fault.  Love the colors and style, so props for that.  Fits more like a medium/large.  Just not a good fit for my mature, plus-size trunk.  Will gift to a thinner relative.",0
1,very thin and cheaply made !! trash,0
1,NOT TRUE TO SIZE  AT ALL,0
1,Literally wore it for 5 mins it it had a hole.,0
2,Not flattering on me.  Very high waist.<br />well made,0
5,"I bought these in an 8-9 medium for my friend. The first pair that came were huge! They said XL on the bottom and they were so big! More like a 10-12. I returned them and ordered an 8-9 again. The next pair came and said XL on the bottom too but they were much smaller. They fit her perfectly. The color is beautiful, they are soft and so comfortable. Just beware of the sizing. Not sure what the problem is but I am sure it is because they are from China. They fit her and she loved them so all is well.",1
5,I love the item it's for my gym,1
3,"Glasses are crystal clear and he reflective coating appears well done.  They fit over my glasses just fine, but be sure to measure...bad ratings for them not fitting is rediculous.<br />Only two issues. Tint is a little lighter then I would hope and the lenses have a slight bubble look to them.",0
1,"They don‚Äôt stay up, I bought these for my 8 year old son. They came and had strings hanging all over the seams. Cheap product.",0
5,The product is so soft & warm. It runs a little big but looks great with leggings & knee boots. I would purchase again!,1
5,"This is a great suit for a bargain, beautiful colors exactly as pictured",1
4,Nice purse. Larger than i expected,1
5,Gloves were so soft and looks quite durable. He hasn't tried the touch screen yet.,1
5,Good quality and good price.,1
5,These gloves are very classy.  I love them.  I'm so glad I ordered them.,1
5,This dress is a must have. It‚Äôs cool and comfortable.,1
5,COMPLETELY WORTH BUYING!,1
3,As advertised,0
5,"Very nice and attractive swimsuit.  We had a time figuring out sizing, but we scored with this one.  My daughter is about 100 lbs and 5'4 and a 32 fit her perfectly.  For those looking for any support in the upper section, there is none.  This is just a singularly, fully lines suit.  My daughter loves the suit!",1
1,"Sorry I can't give zero stars. My wife initially loved the ring, until it changed her fingers color. I'm both bummed and disappointed. Ring is stamped 925 but clearly not sterling...",0
2,"Dress runs small, especially if you have broad shoulders or big / muscular arms. Super tight sleeves. The seam at the back of the skirt was sewn very badly - crooked, uneven and made the butt area have lumps all over it. Will require a slip, as the fabric is pretty sheer.",0
1,Its been two months since i bought thses shoes abd the whole shoe is falling apart.  My daughter only wears them once every two weeks.  Dont buy!,0
5,Great product,1
5,I absolutely love the shirt!  I'm 53 and 120 pounds so based on the previous reviews I ordered a medium. It's neither too tight or too large and it's the softest shirt I am. Definitely a winner!,1
1,"This was a beautiful dress, but it is very thin. Great for a vacation or somewhere really hot if you have the right under garments. Too thin for church or a work event.",0
1,The neck of  t- shirt is too big. I don't like it.,0
5,GREAT VALUE,1
2,Ran small,0
2,"Not a great work out sweatshirt.  Although its weight will certainly make you sweat.  But it sheds a lot (internal to the sweatshirt), which is very annoying.  It will keep you warm.  But so will other products.",0
3,It is a little short but cute,0
5,this is one comfortable and useful apron,1
5,"They arrived on time and they are very beautiful and soft on your head. I am grateful to have found them on Amazon! I highly recommend them for adults/teens and kids. Super soft, affordable and SO worth the money!",1
5,"Loved this dress. Was looking for something with turquoise and brown to match my boots and this had just the right amount of turquoise. Was a perfect dress for a country music festival, as I really wanted the hi-lo feel. Very comfortable and breathable. Got many compliments. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 160 and got a medium. The dress must be tied correctly and tight cause if it comes undone, you‚Äôll suddenly be naked!",1
4,Super cute! The earring pegs were bent but that was just from the packaging. Straightened right out. Love these. Pull the plastic protective layer off to reveal the brighter red and black plastic.,1
2,Too heavy for me. Haven't worn because of that.,0
5,Super soft comfortable slippers for a great price,1
1,I was so disappointed as I was told it was an original and it wasn't it was made in China,0
5,This bracelet was beautiful.  Matched my wedding colors teal and bling! Bridesmaid loved them.,1
3,"First of all this purse is absolutely beautiful! I put the chain shoulder strap on and within minutes the fastener on the purse broke so there was no fixing it. It can be a clutch as well but I liked the fact it had a shoulder strap as well. I put my cell phone and a few make up items in it, which wasn't much and the bottom of the purse pulled apart. It didn't break completely but it did pull apart at the bottom of the purse. I was afraid it was going to just bust open at the bottom but it never did. Outside of those two immediate problems I'll carry the purse again, no doubt.",0
5,These pants fit great and are very comfortable.,1
5,good,1
5,I use sweats as pajamas: they do the job and are relatively inexpensive...,1
2,It hurts and annoys me all day long. The trim doesn't stretch with the panties,0
2,Very cute but run at least two sizes too small.,0
1,Very odd shape- super tight on the bottom but huge on the top. Very short as well. Would have returned it had my daughter not loved the front. Overall cheap poorly made product,0
5,"This purse is so lightweight and soft. I use it  to hold all my stuff.  I can carry my wallet, cell phone, make up and a water bottle comfortably. It‚Äôs leather and great for shopping!",1
3,Well they haven't. Torn up yet,0
5,As advertised and expected,1
5,"I love it ! It's just as described - I really expected less quality, but, for the price paid, I think it's worth it!",1
1,"Got the shirt in.  Definitely not what I expected & not quite what is pictured in the advertising.  I went by the size chart & ordered a Large, shirt fit like a small.  Not baggy or over the shoulder.  I‚Äôm returning it & I ordered an XXL & should be here Tuesday.  If you are ordering I would say order 2 sizes up I guess.",0
1,I had to return this item and it was upsetting because I didn't even want to try it on. It had a strong laundry detergent smell and was dark around the sleeve at the wrist area. The orange was dingy and faded. I really wanted to like the orange and I am saddened that the company would send out a used item especially during a worldwide pandemic. ! Not cool at all.,0
1,This necklace is not even adult size. It doesn't even fit around my neck. The pendant is smaller than in the description. Wouldn't recommend at all.,0
5,"This hat fits my toddler‚Äôs head perfectly. It is lightweight and comfortable, he is happy to wear it all day!",1
5,"I just got these yesterday and I love them! I had found them on another site for almost twice the cost, so thank goodness I checked here before purchasing. The color of the upper was a little darker than my monitor portrayed it, but that was a benefit--they'll be wearable with so much more that way! I do think that these must run a bit big. I normally wear an 8.5 but ordered an 8 since it was all that was left. They fit perfectly! I look forward to wearing these in the spring with skirts, dresses, and even with pants. I'll put up some of my outfit ideas on my blog, [...], this week!",1
5,"We had to move away from my daughter's friend and she gave one to friend and it was heartwarming to watch him open the beautiful little velvet bag‚ù§Ô∏è great quality, classy presentation and fit perfectly.<br />Thank you",1
3,The saying on it is nice but the edges are sharp.,0
5,I'm a tennis player and I play all year round.  During the summer I use it for sun and during the winter when I play indoors it keeps my hair out of my face!  You can't even feel like you have it on...light as a feather.  I rinse it off and its dry and ready to go in 20 min.  I have them in many colors and I also use it at the beach...super comfy!!,1
5,"Great construction, sturdy and looks great, and most of all comfortable. With some outside the box thinking I fit an entire survival kit in mine without being a bit noticeable by others.",1
1,"Defenittly not midi dress length, more like petite length.",0
3,worth the amount you paid,0
5,"this is an awesome helmet and I love it. the flip down visor is a great feature and works exactly like its supposed to. I was worried about it falling down when I didn't want it to, this has not happened, the only downside is the wind noise which is very hard to get rid of with the chinstrap. overall its exactly what i wanted.",1
2,looks and feels great but changed its appearance and became pillowy after first wash. Will not be able to order any more even though its a great sock otherwise.,0
4,"Good deal. Comfy, go for it.",1
5,as advertised,1
2,I couldn't even wear this ring because it wasn't smooth enough to not cause discomfort. Made my finger hurt and left red mark from scratching my skin. Gave it away.,0
5,"I LOVE this dress!  It is perfect for work.  Very soft and comfortable. I got the Apricot Leopard.  The colors go well together and I can wear it into the Fall.  I am 5'4"" and 125 lbs and I got a small.  It fits perfectly and the length is right at my knees.",1
1,I bought this for my husband. He really wanted it. He absolutely loved it. Then it started to lose time. Then small hand fell off. My husband took it off. I wanted to send it back but he opens the box once a day to look at it. He said it was his favorite watch ever. It's very nice and expensive looking. But tears up fast :(,0
2,Not made for DDD or DD. They only hold the breasts up by 2 inches,0
4,"Bought two, one for each of my daughters.<br />Wrote a rather scathing review previously but changed my opinion when the 2nd one arrived.<br />They are very nice gifts.",1
5,Muy bonitos y comodos,1
5,LOVE! It is so soft and I adore font I chose for my son. This is the perfect pillowcase for him. The quality is excellent! Would definitely buy againüòä And will recommend to everyone!,1
4,Very cute and comfortable to wear...,1
1,These are not the socks in the picture. The picture is brown why are mine pink,0
1,"The product material is cheap and the plastic zipper has no integrity whatsoever.<br />The first time I put on the jumpsuit was to wear it to a family dinner. However, the zipper split immediately and I could not zip it back down to recombine the teeth. Eventually I had to tear the zipper apart just to remove the suit from my body. Spend a little more money for something that will actually withstand more than a one time wear.",0
4,"So very cute, but posts were bent when they arrived. Bent them back; don't know many wearings I can expect but knew they were inexpensive when I purchased them. Really like them!",1
5,"This is a good product for someone who is on the shorter height.  I am 4'7', I was worried that the bag would hang to low or even be to wide, but it is just right for me.  I don't like to carry lot of things on my back or shoulder, so this type of bag size helps me to not pack so heavily.  I also love the color, I was curious if it was going to be a brighter red but it's not thank goodness.  It's beautiful, light, simple and just enough compartments.  I do recommend this, which coming from a person who is VERY picky about the items she buys, I say, go for it! After all, you can't judge a book by it's cover.  I learned that lesson when buying this as I was skeptical and was ready to ship it right back however, I was VERY pleased.",1
5,These are so dainty and elegant,1
1,"So cheap, broke upon receipt. Ordered another since they are so cheap- it broke immediately. Get exactly what you pay for.",0
1,Much larger than picture. Not usable,0
5,Looks exactly how it‚Äôs pictured my daughter loves it and it made my shopping so much easier,1
4,"I'm 5'8"", 150lbs, 34C and got a large.. the fit is nice, not restrictive. The sleeve openings are a tad small. The fabric and quality are awesome. Pockets are perfect. Not totally thrilled with where the ribbon trim sits--it feels like it should be higher or lower/empire waist height. Instead, it sits about an inch above the widest point of the bust. If your boobs sit differently, it may not bother you, but if I buy more, I'll pay more attention to how the top is structured.",1
1,The fabric on these masks is so dense it lets no air through.  All the air goes around the mask.  You don't get any filtering protection.,0
3,they are ok.,0
1,"Wow. Leather bounding is torn. Cheaper than I could have done at the dollar store as a whole. The rhinestone decorations are stuck to a still sticky matte of glue, but have lost one in the package already.  Not worth $5 let alone what I paid üòî",0
3,It looked just like a scarf. You could get the same thing at your local beauty supply store for $3-4. Wasn't what I was expecting. and was overpriced imo,0
5,Updated: 7/7/2017:<br />I liked this watch when I got it and gave a favorable review. I had a problem with the latch releasing so I sent an email to the seller. He sent me a replacement right away. This latch is much better so I think they have made the necessary adjustments. Great watch for a great price and a very responsive seller.,1
5,Obsessed! Such a cute staple in my collection,1
2,They were very cute but I ordered a size 2 and they were way too small for my daughter and she wears a 2 in all her other shoes. I think they run one size smaller than what it is.,0
5,"I am in love with this top it‚Äôs super cute and it looks just like the picture. It is true to size. I got a size small and it fits perfectly. The material is super good and you can see is really well-made by looking at the stitching. The lacing is phenomenal, and all the little details are on point. The lacing is really smooth to touch and it‚Äôs not itchy like other kinds of lace. I really recommend this cute top.",1
1,Inner seam was not stitch properly and had a 6 inch hole,0
5,Love the sleeves there are adorable! Great seller!,1
5,Nice earrings and very cheap.,1
5,"Great quality, the fabric is very nice and looks expensive. Getting ready to buy another one for my daughter.",1
5,My son is convinced this is the actual ring from the trilogy. It looks just like it! He wears it on a gold chain around his neck and shows it off to his buddies. It's a very unique gift. The company that made it was easy to work with and they shipped quickly.,1
5,Love them,1
1,Zipper came damage not worth it. Go 1 size bigger does not stretch,0
5,"Cool, great to run in.  Lightweight. Comfortable",1
2,"The material is a thick, shiny polyester with a printed pattern, not dyed so, the reverse is white.  The fit wasn't as baggy as I was expecting.",0
1,"cheap made and the zippers broke on the first use, and too late to return it.",0
5,"I bought this brand last year for my son, and it lasted all of cross country and track season. I bought these for my daughter and so far, they are holding up. She used it all through cross country season, practices, and after season meets. They still look great! On to track season!",1
2,This product shows signs of discoloration and loss of elasticity after only about 130 - 140 hours (4 to 5 months the way I pace my regular swimming) in a swimming pool environment. It is un-usable after 6 months of my regular swimming schedule.,0
5,Very nice ratings. Color is a darker honey tone which looks great with my winter outfits.,1
5,"I keep it with me everyday as a reminder of loss, hope and spirituality.",1
5,fit as it should just like in photo.,1
5,Like them a lot .,1
5,Love these.,1
2,"la verdad es que pense que seria mas comoda la cartea, pero no es asi. Es muy alta y tiende a salirse del bolsillo del pantalon, tuve que cortar el pedazo de mas, si no se saldria y perderia mis documentos y dinero. NO LA RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!!",0
1,"They jus turn everything yellow, I did not notice any change in glare. I‚Äôm very disappointed!",0
1,"Not stretchy at the bottom part so a major inconvenience, because this is a beautiful dress very disappointed",0
5,Super cute. It‚Äôs become one of my daughter‚Äôs favorite dresses.,1
2,"Others have mentioned the weight, and I didn't think much of it.  This thing is HEAVY!  The Charge 2 is a lot lighter than the Charge HR that it is replacing, to add that much weight makes no sense.  I wanted to dress up the band, not add wrist weights to work out during the day.  As a comparison, the band alone (no Charge attached) is heavier than my entire Rolex GMT Master and band, and I consider the Rolex a heavy watch.  I am keeping the Baylite leather band, and returning this to Amazon.",0
1,Is not what discribe,0
5,i freakin luv it. its awesome,1
2,Loved the colors but it was to big for my daughter,0
5,My husband just loved it,1
5,Wear a pair almost everyday.,1
1,This set is not a cute look. The crotch of the pants sags nearly to my knees lol And the waist band is thick elastic - I ordered an xl after reading other reviews because I wanted it loose and comfortable (I‚Äôm usually a size 4) and the waist band is still snug. The material is nice though! I wish this had worked out but unfortunately it looks ridiculous.,0
2,"It is a struggle to attach these to my prescription glasses, and sometimes I just use my sunglasses instead.",0
5,Excellent frame,1
1,"The glue came off the post and we lost the swinging body. Very sad, they were so cute!!!",0
1,I have twin girls and one of my twins is 25 pounds with fat legs and the other twin is a skinny 20 pounds with skinny legs. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying this for a chunky baby it feels like it‚Äôs cutting off circulation for my fat twin and my skinny twin it just falls right off her leg. But in general these knee pads don‚Äôt stay up I‚Äôm constantly pulling them up every 5 mins and it‚Äôs not enough padding to protect their knees while crawling.,0
5,The item works very well,1
1,The cups are foam with no support. Even if it fit the cups have nothing. I emailed them and they took forever to respond.  They wanted my measurements to confirm. I told them it was the foam cups. It took forever for them to just give me address to send it back. Worst ever I will have to take the loss,0
5,Fits fine.,1
3,"This tiara looks very pretty in your hands, the golden fabric and details are pretty, but the shape of it doesn't fit a childs head very well. It didn't work for my 4 years old daughter so far.",0
5,Fit,1
5,Purchased for our granddaughter that is in Nursing school...She loved it. Very surprised.,1
4,"I love these leggings!  So much so that this is my second pair. My first pair only lasted about 5 wears and then there were holes in them. But, you get what you pay for.  I will more than likely by another pair when these get holes too.",1
3,The size online said 4/5 and when it arrived the tag said 4. It fits like a 4 so it won't last us very long. The material is very thin. Super cute but I don't expect it will last.,0
4,"Doesn't look as depicted, however it is a nice looking item I wear when dressing up.",1
5,"Great product, as described",1
1,I have a pair I got last year. Went to buy 3 more pair this year same size. The pair I got last year fit well and very comfortable. The pairs I got this year I had to return. Table size is clearly not the correct size. Must be using another Country to make them. You need to fix this. False advertising.,0
5,This dress is beautiful. Ran a bit on the small side. My biggest complaint is one of the ties was too short,1
1,Poor quality material.  It looked like a child had made it. I would be ashamed to wear it in public.,0
5,Love this necklace. We get so many compliments. It goes well with so many outfits.,1
5,Loved it! Wore it for my Up! Engagement Photoshoot,1
1,They broke after 2 times of wearing them. They were also massive for my head.,0
4,"I have somewhat large hips, so I figured that this was the perfect style.  I wasn't expected them to be knee length, and they are pretty big in the bust.  The style is pretty - but you do need a cami underneath otherwise your bra lines show",1
5,"Love it, gives comfort to my feet after standing in work for 12 hours.  Just what I needed.",1
3,"This is a cute bag but it's much smaller than the pics make it out to be. Since the material is very hard, you cant squeeze anything in so it really only holds a phone, a lipstick and one of those card holders, no wallet.",0
3,It was ok for the price!,0
5,The best I have found so far and service is also good,1
5,"These are so soft, and the fit was perfect!",1
1,This is NOT a rain jacket. It is not waterproof at all.,0
5,"Fits snug, if you want it bagger size up.",1
3,Most of them are cute but material is so cheap that most have been casualties,0
5,"Beautiful bracelet, I love it",1
1,There was very little to like about this product‚Ä¶ the construction had so many design flaws (there is no support or back fabric it is an elastic band sewed onto the cups) shorts didn‚Äôt fit me but that doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the construction. All issues really lay with the top being so poorly designed. I felt as though if I bent over my entire chest would fall out so I‚Äôm not exactly sure how this is labeled ‚Äúworkout‚Äù wear. I would give this no stars if I could.,0
5,Cute design and velcro closure works well. Will definitely do the job in the water to keep my bangs out of my eyes.,1
5,"Product looks great and as pictured. Nice details & feels sturdy. Color looks ""rich"" but not fake. Ratings based on appearance only as it has not been worn.",1
5,My wife love those for her party!,1
2,This sweater does not have lantern sleeves. It fits very slouchy. The picture and description are deceiving.,0
5,Cute fit,1
2,Returned,0
5,"This piece was absolutely beautiful. If there were ever a need to get another, I definitely would.<br /><br />The item was capable of being read clearly and perfectly carved. Very light weight and a smooth texture.<br /><br />If there was ever a time where I could finally finish my search for the perfect piece, now is it.",1
5,Well mad and beautiful,1
1,"Too tight, and I don't have a big head. Cannot sleep in it. Made few cuts on the side but still did not help. Won't buy it again.",0
4,The goggles and nose plug are awesome. I ended up cutting the earplugs off the goggles because they fall out when you swim anyway. The cap is not waterproof and slides on when I swim fast.,1
1,It's ugly!!!,0
5,Really classy. Just make sure you pay attention to other reviews about ordering larger size than your normal size.,1
1,It says it‚Äôs for an adult but it doesn‚Äôt fit.,0
5,I liked the material but I don‚Äôt like Pullovers. I didn‚Äôt realize it was a man‚Äôs Hoodie so it was huge on me so my son was happy to have it. Very Neat but when I get hot I have to have a quick way to take it off,1
5,I dislike the advice to get extra large. That do not work with this type of fabric for a plus size it was advised to get the extra large. I did and hated it. Had to keep pulling it down and it snugged just too tight. It looked horrible. I suggest to get the larger size as I did. I love the fit.,1
2,"The picture is miss leading. It's a crop top in the font, not long like the back. Disappointing",0
1,Just came already worn I was very disappointed,0
3,"Shirt is fine, but stripes almost look like optical illusion. Gave me a headache... lol",0
3,"Not easy to use, slips and not very attractive.",0
5,Great product would recommend to any one looking.,1
5,Fit perfectly. Super soft and comfy I'll be buying one in every color,1
3,A bit large..overall looks great.,0
5,Man they look great! And boy do they smell!,1
5,Gorgeous and well made. Thank you,1
3,If your looking for turquoise this was way too blue but pretty,0
3,Like the style just wish it was just a bit bigger,0
2,"Originally thought these were well made, high quality leather, extremely comfortable without looking dowdy. I even bought another pair in a different color!!<br /><br />Now after about 4 months the sole is peeling off completely and is a tripping hazard. üòï<br /><br />Such a disappointment...and a waste of money. The only reason I gave 2 stars and not just 1 is because before they fell apart they were my favorite shoes for everyday use--comfortable and pretty.",0
5,"So pretty, and great quality for the price! Wrinkle-free! Stuffed in suitcase for vaca, and didn't need to iron or steam.",1
2,"I bought this item based on reviews, primarily focused on the sturdiness of continual use. Sorry to say, the reviews don't hold up and the product simply is not of the quality stated. First off, the impression from the pictures is that a metal turnbuckle is under the plastic (black) sheath. NOT TRUE, it is simply hardened plastic with nut female receptacles at each end. I used this once on a cotton pair of shorts, and even in tightening there was play in the shaft and nut fitting together. Play is a simple way of saying the shaft and nut do not fit exactly and you can jiggle then when screwed into each other. Not good.<br /><br />The shorts did stretch as advertised. But then I used them on a pair of Levi's, and the unit simply bowed (as you tighten, the shaft starts to bend upward) and became hard to turn and the turnbuckle portion (the plastic shaft in the middle that I assumed was all steel) just bent. $23 bucks is not a bad price, and with the hardware and wood workmanship, is probably right on as a price point. The problem is in the missing steel turnbuckle in the middle, which is hard plastic.<br /><br />The best I can say is he/she designer gave me the blueprint to make something that will actually work and I ordered a forged (all) steel turnbuckle from E Rigging. I will cut my own wood pieces and have an ultra sturdy unit that will never fail. A six inch turnbuckle with a 3/4 shaft that will hold 5200lbs.<br /><br />Admittedly I turned it until very tight (stretching the jeans waist), but by<br /><br />the sellers description of the product and sturdiness, this should not have been a problem.<br /><br />I like to see inventive people successful, I hope they come up with a sturdier design and make a million bucks.  ;-)))",0
5,"These fit my glasses perfectly! I wish they were a little darker, but I couldn't be happier to be able to wear my favorite sunglasses again!",1
1,"This bracelet looks great.  It is very high quality and looks beautiful.  I was happy to know that it looks more gold and not rose gold color.  Unfortunately, the anchor portion of the bracelet is too sharp and the shape of it sticks out.  This causes the bracelet to really dig into your wrist.  After wearing it for only a few minutes, it cut my skin in several spots.  I also gave this as a gift and my friend experienced the same thing.  This looks pretty but is completely impractical.  You won't wear this.  Save your money.  The company needs to redesign the shape of the anchor and smooth the edges.",0
1,"This company must not be aware what ""plus"" size is",0
1,The &#34;voice&#34; is sword noises I have never been so insulted,0
2,"these run small and I reordered a size bigger, got yesterday and they fit the same..Will be returning the second pair as well. Gonna try one more top at even larger size and if that doesn't work will give up and go back to my DAWGS!",0
5,the best product and fabric plus the design,1
3,"Ordered for work (dialysis nurse). I want to love it; it feels sturdy & high-quality, I like the design, etc.<br />It's unusable for me. It slides down my nose constantly, and if I even slightly tilt my head/lean down, it falls right off. It's way too big - and I have a big head! If I could get it in a smaller size, I'd buy it again immediately.",0
1,NO NO NO! Material is sooooo horrible. Not anything like shown in picture. Definitely size up!,0
3,Cute but turning my girl's finger green.,0
1,Poor quality,0
2,Jewels had already fallen of when i received it.,0
4,Good item.,1
3,"I ordered large size which is my usual size, however the chest/top part is too tight. Perfect length for women's who is 5'2.  Quality is not what I expected, fabric is too thin, with excess thread along the seam line.  Price is too high for the quality of the shirt. 3 stars though for the floral design.",0
4,Really comfortable and super cute. The fabric is a little see-through which is a tad annoying. But other than that it fit really well,1
1,The rubber part of the strap broke the second day I used it on one of the straps.  The other one I have used has held up so far (abet it‚Äôs been less than a week).,0
5,Product does a lot of smartphone type activity!,1
1,When I opened the plastic bag the smell was absolutely gross!  It kind of smelled like burnt rubber.<br />I want my money back but the seller dropped the ball.  The jewelry was also very cheap looking.<br />I will never buy anything from them again.,0
2,Too small,0
4,Darling. Perfect neutral to go with many outfits. Runs normal or maybe a little on the small side. Definitely size up if you are between sizes.,1
5,Very nice,1
1,"These are soft pants. My son, who has Sensory Processing Disorder, loved them. Sadly, he wore them once and the knees are worn out (he is not a rough and tumble kid, either) and the stitching on the hem has come completely undone after just one wash. Good idea, but terrible execution. I can't believe how expensive these pants are. Sweat pants from Walmart hold up better than these. Awful.",0
5,Light weight easy care. Comfortable.,1
3,The lenses are hard to get clean.  They like to smear easily but getting stuff off is tougher than OEM lenses.,0
5,"got this in the smallest size for my 8 yr old daughter & she absolutely loves it!~ Nice quality, not too thin of material, quality printscreening",1
3,Didn‚Äôt like the fit. the Bra that came with two in a package were not in the packages. Didn‚Äôt like that,0
5,Granddaughter loves them!  They light up just like her face lights up when she ‚Äúgets‚Äù to wear them (she‚Äôd wear them to bed if mom would let her)!,1
5,Perfect,1
5,They are soft and warm and the perfect thickness for casual wear. 10/10 I love them good colors. They seem like they should be more expensive,1
5,This tank tops fits well and it‚Äôs comfortable.,1
3,Already did,0
3,"The earrings are very pretty.  However, the post is not in the middle; therefore, the earrings won't stay straight on the ear.",0
1,This set got atuck in my ears for days. Till i used a set of nail clippers to get it out.,0
4,My friend and I bought this for an event with low expectations. When our dresses came a couple of days later we were pleased with the result. Would recommend this to anyone!<br />Very comfortable<br />Stylish<br />Good color<br />Love it!!!!!,1
5,"Made much better than I expected. Keep me warm, and the hat is awesome.",1
1,Looks cool but too small...or maybe my head is too big...,0
1,I wear shoe size 6.<br />This one is comfortable but too big for me.,0
5,I got these for a off the shoulder shirt. I was worried that though out the day it would start slipping! Nope!! Stayed in place! Very comfy! I  recommend these for all sizes!,1
5,"Super cute, pretty cranberry color.",1
3,Rhinestones started falling off within a few days.,0
3,"Kind of bootleg, real flashy but those diamonds pop out randomly when removing on & off besides that it looked pretty great when I 1st got it",0
1,"When I received this product, it initially worked great; however, after a few weeks I noticed that the internal bag wouldn't expand; thus, preventing me from putting more water in the container. Then the straw connected to the top spray started coming off, and now the product is no longer spraying rather it shoots a stream. I am very disappointed with this product!",0
1,I had high hopes for this dress but it was a no!,0
5,"Very comfortable. I have a physically demanding job, but I have to dress professionally. These pants are perfect. I had to go one size up, but I love the way they look & feel on me.",1
1,"Returned. Frame too weak to support the lens. Polarized lens was not bad, but creaked with the low tolerance contact points in the frame. I don't doubt this would break soon, or in cold weather have issues.<br /><br />The discounted price makes this almost not worth the trouble to return, and it ended up taking over an hour of frustration for UPS/amazon errors in that process. I imagine the seller is banking on that frustration point to make the sales.",0
4,You definitely get what you pay for. The material isn‚Äôt the best but the design is really pretty. Doesn‚Äôt feel scratchy.,1
5,"Great purchase, just what I wanted.",1
4,"Pretty. Heavy.  Comes in a plastic little baggie. Strong jump ring and key ring, itself.",1
1,It looks very cheap and tacky. I am sending it back.,0
2,"Threading is coming undone, and just wore a few times! Plus they both seem small, but it was told that they are appx. 8 inches long. Now I know what size fits me.",0
1,"Returned, very thin with a prison kinda look.",0
2,go 2 size's up,0
4,Great quality,1
5,"Fit as expected, quality is fine, decent price and my son loves them.",1
4,"This mask is comfortable to work out in.  My guy is 6ft 250 lbs with a beard.  The standard face masks don't really fit him at all.  Most straps either dig into his head, snap or just don't fit.  the ones that do fit look rather comical on him.  This mask is large enough that it actually fits over both his mouth and nose and lower face at the same time.  He can easily breath while working out and the back is adjustable.  Works great.",1
5,Identical to the $100 Apple band!,1
1,"Bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. It‚Äôs beautiful. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it was labeled as stainless and within one day of wearing it(less than 12 hours!) it turned his finger green!",0
5,"Beautiful. Little big for my small wrist, but love it.",1
3,Way too large but decent quality,0
5,Very comfortable and soft,1
5,"High quality, totally thrilled the gift recipient!!..who doesn't love a Kate Spade bag!!",1
5,Did it‚Äôs job and broke until I pulled it wayyy to hard and if not it would be working til this day,1
1,I have 3 rings and all are size 7.5 or 8 and most freely move easily on my finger. Ordered this set in an 8 and it was WAY to small. Not a size 8! Both rings had different sizes solid band was even smaller than stoned band.,0
1,hard to wear,0
5,Love this dress. It fit perfectly. I ordered what it said based on height and weight and it was correct. Excellent quality.,1
1,Couldn‚Äôt get them over my hips.  Legs were a good size.  I was very disappointed.  I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and they were still way too small.,0
5,Love these!,1
5,"The pants are very comfy, high waist, and have a quality feel.",1
3,"Not sure how to rate this, I guess I need help or a suggestion on how to fix the image. I've made two of them and they both have a flaw.",0
5,"Great fit, light breathable material, perfect length.<br />I'm 5'6&#34; 30&#34;waist 34e and 42&#34; hips and the size medium was perfect",1
4,I had no dislikes,1
5,I'm so glad I found these nursing bras. I normally am a 36DD and ordered a large even though the size chart said go xxl. The large fits like a glove and I barely feel it while wearing it. For the price I'm very much impressed. I wish there were more colors to buy.,1
3,To small,0
3,The metal is so thin and flimsy it broke after wearing it only a few times. I wouldn't buy it again.,0
1,the plunger valve broke after only a couple uses and then it leaked out AND it had some kind of lubricant to keep the plunger valve smooth and that wrecked a nice pair of pants.,0
4,"Its a mask, looks exactly like pictured. Works just fine, is comfortable, and it did come with 6 filters. Not a bad buy in my opinion.",1
3,I loved the shoes but they fall apart after a few weeks of wear. They are so darn cute I just order more and toss them after a month or so. The soles come unglued and the stitching around the zippers comes out but they are cute and comfy for their short life span!,0
3,"This pin is TOO SMALL!  Just over ONE INCH. True it is a lapel pin, but being a SURVIVOR  of breast cancer I am proud to celebrate it. This is a nice pin but should be ATLEAST TWO inches long!!!",0
2,Advertised as white but it‚Äôs more of a cream color. It‚Äôs way more cropped than it appears in the photos and the fabric is scratchy.,0
3,material a little thin but its ok,0
5,Easy to read screen nice and bright,1
3,Sizing is off you need to size up twice<br />Good quality,0
1,"I ordered the same size I usually order, I cannot zip the back machine, style very different with what you see on line, if possible to return it because it is not the dress I will wear or even give to a friend",0
5,Fits my child well. Cute design. Easy to put on and remove. Good quality.,1
1,The plastic wrapping was sloppily taped shut and there was a film of grease and fingerprints on the outside. So gross. Pissed that I can‚Äôt return it since I need a clear bag for an event.,0
3,Too long.,0
3,Kirkland Signature Jeans are the best jeans in the world.  I ordered a 34 x 30 and they are a full two inches longer than my other 34 x 30 inch pairs.  They are easily 34 x 32. Damn it.,0
3,Good quality for the price and the length is great for the office,0
3,"This was awful for me. But I believe it could be great for some people. The top was just a piece of fabric, so you have to wrap it and tie it to wear it. This didn't go well for me. I don't think it was because the size of my breast, 36DD, I think I may have been too small for it in general. This seems like it would be better for plus size girls. I really think it work well had I been a little thicker.",0
3,Not good quality,0
5,"Shoes fit great! They seem to be wearing well,  no rips.",1
4,"Was very pleased with this item.  Picture does not do it justice, very cute.",1
3,"Our son wears a XXL shirt - sometimes they are a bit large on him, but I thought this would fit.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS SHIRT LIKE?<br />This shirt is made from a thin chambray fabric.  It is 100% cotton as stated which is good.  It does not appear to be pre-washed which means that shrinkage is more likely than it is with pre-washed shirts.<br /><br />STITCHING<br />Stitching is fantastic.  Triple row and double row stitching decorate this shirt in white contrast to the denim tone of blue in the fabric.<br /><br />BUTTONS<br />The buttons are a bit small for this size shirt- I would have liked to see them just a bit larger, but that might not bother most people.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />When making a large sized shirt- putting tiny pockets on it tend to make the shirt look weird.  These pockets are a bit small for this size of a shirt.  They should be larger.<br /><br />FIT<br />This is not an oversized fit by any means.  This is made to be a bit smaller than other big/tall sized shirts.  The fit is smaller than we expected- and it is a bit shorter too.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice shirt, decent quality with a few size issues where parts look a bit small for the size it is.  If it appeals to you and you are on the larger side, try ordering a size or two up from normal if you like things roomy.  This is also prone to shrink more than other shirts too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This is a nice shirt, but could do with some improvement to make it a really GREAT shirt for this size man.",0
5,"This is the third one I bought and I just love it. Perfect size and great quality, and the they don't loose the color with time.",1
5,I get so many complements every time I year this. The best part is house comfy and warm it is and its super cute. The sleeves are hard to fit in some of my coats but I absolutely love this sweater,1
2,The top doesn‚Äôt fit like should seem way to wide tried to tie it better see if that was the problem but nope it‚Äôs jus made that way,0
5,Really cute.  Using for holloween.,1
3,Very small. Would not recommend for larger headed children,0
2,This bracelet was of very poor quality. It looked more like a $5 bracelet than the $20 I paid for it. A lot of the antiquing was already gone and the pearls were extremely cheap. If the quality were better this would have been a beautiful piece of jewelry.,0
5,I play basketball every now and then when I go to the gym. Tell me why I put hits on and started dunking on mfs! I was so astounded I didn't know what to do! Step back 3's? No problem. Euro step jams over 2 defenders? Got it! If you're thinking about getting this then I recommend you DO IT! Just be ready to be the focus point of every game you play in.,1
2,"Cons:<br />Deceptive imagery makes the bag look bigger. I measured it and compared with the listed measurements and it is definitely smaller. Being made in China, I'm not sure if this really had quality-assurance as two side straps were already disconnected upon delivery and thus useless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Held up to about 20 pounds of books and items being lugged across Australia, and the neck strap never broke! ALSO, LOTS OF POCKETS! Probably the best feature.<br /><br />I wish the bag were bigger though, as well as the little accessory pouch. I couldn't even fit a regular water bottle inside it.",0
4,"It's a really good looking vest, very smart looking! BUT it's bit ROOMY, and I say this as a man who's 6'0"" 210lbs of solid muscle. Seriously, I'm in REALLY good shape, think Captain America build. I wore this over top of a polo shirt and the shoulders have A LOT OF give to them (and I've got BROAD shoulders)... this is one of those things that I think that going a size down would be ok, but ONLY if you're looking to wear this with one layer under it. If you're wearing this over a jacket, go with your normal size.<br /><br />The vest has an interesting thick pad at the back of the neck. It's NOT lightweight, it has a bit of drag to it, I hope that it won't be waterlogged in the rain, if so, this thing will be ""heavy"".<br /><br />Sadly one of the elastic bands on the side for the radio pocket snapped on DAY ONE! üò† However, for me, it wasn't a deal breaker. Just saying, the darn thing... snapped!",1
3,"Initially I loved this belt, it feels sturdy and looks great.  However, in less than 4 months the stitching that holds the belt loop in place has started to come loose.  I will be looking for a new belt!",0
3,"I thought it ran big compare to Longitudes version, also straps very thin.",0
5,Great,1
5,Bought them for my sister for Christmas. She says she loves them.,1
5,Awesome costume.  One of the buttons needs a little sewing on action but otherwise a very authentic costume.,1
5,It's perfect. I'm excited to wear it. I bought the size I wear.  I've told several women about my great experience with this item.,1
3,Just took it out of the bag and there is a hole in them.  They look comfy but...not sure how to get a replacement?,0
5,Love<br />Love love love this dress! Fits sooo comfortably.<br />Colors are just as vibrant as the picture. Love in it!,1
5,Love it!  I got lots of compliments and I just ordered the necklace that matches!,1
5,The items fit nicely,1
1,No way are these socks made with even the tiniest amount of wool. I sent them back as they won‚Äôt be warm.,0
5,Beautiful,1
2,It made me look bigger than I am. It looks very cheap,0
5,"Love this bag!!  The color is a great purple and the embellishments add such a nice touch!  It's a big bag though, so I think it'd be best for teen dancers.  My 10 year old is in 4 dance classes and it still looked too big for her.",1
1,"This product is nothing more than an over sized ear covering.  Does not provide any protection from sounds, water or anything else.  Just falls off when you turn your head sideways.  Promptly returned.",0
3,"Runs small, not made for larger heads. It's a well made hat.",0
1,It fits alright but it was cracked when I took it out of the package. The watch works though. :(,0
4,Soft and good material but shrunk one size after washing. For that reason I usually buy 2 sizes bigger for my child.,1
5,Very cute little purse. Somewhat cheap looking but you get what you pay for. It is a great little bag for a little girl.,1
5,Absolutely feels good on your body and  looks great on you too.,1
5,We all lose those silly pad inserts. They send you a back up pair.,1
3,small small small,0
1,This is a misrepresentation of what you really will receive! A short poor quality poor quality yellow button shirt not even denim! It cost more to return than it does to buy! This is such a fraud!!! Amazon does not accept this return you have to mail it to CHINA! Cheapest 30.00 postage! Worst thing I have ever ordered on Amazon‚Ä¶.BEWARE,0
4,"Its the perfect size and shape, the black isnt pure black like I expected, but overall I am happy with this purchase.",1
4,Looks sharp for how  inexpensive it is.  Almost looks too fancy if that can be  viewed as a bad thing.  Metal is glossier than i expected.,1
2,"The looks of the watch is pleasing . and it wears well. The problem is at the end of each month you have to manually change it to the first  of the month . The date runs 01 through 00 before it gose to the first of each month . When you get to the 30th of each month you have to push the date button until you get to 00 in order to change the date . What is bad is that the watch runs 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37.38,39.00. It gets old after a while<br />and While the watch is nice to look at I would not buy it again",0
2,"Obviously,  a costumes piece, but the value hardly being even $8 USD. The tail went straight into the trash. Did not fit at at like a tail and did not add to the costume. The trident (as shown on the pictures, so no surprise there) is indeed very short and toy- like.",0
5,These are my favorite summer shirts.,1
5,"Super soft and comfortable! They're so comfortable I can sleep in them. They aren't super tight, but they don't fall down.",1
5,"Very sturdy, hasn't broken yet. Is great for school use and can hold things great. It would be a plus if it had a plastic protective seal but still works great. Best purchase yet.",1
5,Love love love these sandals - have s verbal pairs!! I have bad knees and these are great.,1
5,I wore this dress to my baby shower. It was very comfortable and flattering. Highly recommended.,1
3,Very thin fabric but it has pockets!! Yay for pockets!,0
2,"The arm holes are big. You would need to wear a second tank top under it. I bou several of these. I ended up keeping them, but I needed to alter each me.",0
5,Soft and warm. Easy to slip on and off. Canada knows how to do warm!,1
5,very nice!! for me the best. good quality and low price. and very comfortable,1
5,These are better than Croakies. Much more sturdy design and many more (fun) design selection.,1
4,"These are adorable and so soft, but order up a size if you like your nighties a little roomy. I‚Äôm 135 and 5‚Äô4‚Äù and the medium just fits. Will still keep though as I just wear it to lounge in",1
4,"I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is as pictured. The material kind of reminds me of swimsuit material, which is fine. I wear it with jean shorts and it looks cute! Buy accordingly to the chart. I am 5'5 135 lbs. It is stretchy and the tie string helps it conform to your body. If you like sexy, you'll like this!",1
3,This product is just OK!  I can take it or leave it.  It's not what I would call a pillow slide.  It's a simi-soft slide & far from a cushiony pillow softness. A quick slide on for getting out of bed & that's it!,0
1,The hook broke the minute I tried to pull it back to attach the mask. Extremely disappointed.,0
1,Too small,0
3,"Hard plastic-like rubber, but look nice",0
1,Too smaal and too tight,0
5,My granddaughter just loved her new tutu.  Excellent choice.,1
1,No es original y a calidad es mala,0
5,Awesome product for the price. Try these before buying the expensive ones. They are fantastic,1
1,The heels are flimsy. They bend easily.,0
5,Okok,1
2,"Received it just in time for an out-of-country trip, however it came with a hole in the seams.",0
5,Like the soft leather,1
1,The clasp broke almost instantly after wearing it,0
5,I love this bag. It went prefect with my dress.,1
5,I have a cranky heel and this shoe makes my water exercise class comfortable for me.,1
5,"I am 5‚Äô5 and very curvaceous (hips: 44, waist: 34, bust: 44). My only complaint is that I wish the coverage on the cups was a little larger and the tie on the front a bit smaller. I am a 34DDD, so it is very hard to find tops that adequately cover the girls while not being too large around my ribs. The tie was a little too long to tie it like the pictures, so I had to put it in a bow, which was still cute. Besides a few near nip slips, this was my favorite bikini to wear in Mexico. The material was thick and not see-through at all. I LOVE the cheeky bottoms and plan on bringing this on all of my vacations!",1
1,Fit was good but material is very cheap. But you get what you pay for,0
2,I was very impressed with these sunglasses for the low price. They are very lightweight and the polarization is great. My husband has been using them for fishing and he can definitely see more things in the water than I can with my non-polarized glasses. I‚Äôm actually thinking of ordering a pair for myself at this price.<br /><br />I am updating my review because these lasted 1 summer and the lenses started to peel apart,0
3,Just wasn't what I was looking for so I returned it. I am also 5ft 2in and it was too long for me.,0
1,"very low quality item. do not buy, much better off with disposable medical masks.",0
4,"I own many watches none of which are super  expensive where you have to wear a fake in case of theft. I say that because I have friend who owns a Rolex but wears the knock off in case he gets ripped off. If you have to worry about that why own an expensive watch? Hence I own everyday, everyman watches that are just an accessory to clothing and a lifelong habit. I am a Dodger baseball fan and needed a blue watch to compliment jeans and q Dodger blue jersey. This  fits the bill perfectly with one slight flaw. The little hand is about two numbers off of where it should be. For example if it is two o'clock the hour indicating arm will not point directly at the two o'clock but rather on the 8 minutes. This is most noticeable as the top of the hour approaches or has passed. I think it is not noticeable to many eyes as I've asked people if they notice anything odd or different about my new watch. The answers are hilarious and never that the small hand is off by two places. I plan to take it to my watch jeweler to see if he can fix it so it lines up perfectly. Otherwise  it is a good basic watch you can wear for any casual event. It looks great with jeans and blue ensemble. I think the flaw is just one of those things and not a constant with all the watches. It's a cool everyday watch  for any man. It would make a good gift for a young person as well.",1
5,I absolutely love this cardigan! It‚Äôs thick and comfortable. Fits just below waist and the plus: pockets.,1
5,"Little short, but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù. Lovely dress!",1
5,What a nice watch for the money. This is my 3rd Forsining watch. Its a beauty!  Worth much more.,1
3,"It was expensive looking scarf for it's price. I agree with other clients, that it's soft and very pretty. Our toddler loved it and wore it for hours. I've washed it and the black stars weren't so black anymore and the material wasn't as great as it was. Looked much cheaper and I was surprised to see it. It's fine to ware it on the playground.",0
3,I wanted to like these pants- but the length was just too short- I am only 5‚Äô4‚Äù/ the material seemed nice though,0
3,"It's just &#34;okay.&#34; I was surprised it wasn't longer, I'm 5'2&#34;, the sweater only comes down to my upper thighs/very top of the leg. It appears longer in the example photo, to me.<br /><br />The neck is a double layer and very tight.<br />The sleeves are more 3/4 quarter than over the wrist.<br />All and all, it's nice material, but I have purchased  better fitting, nicer looking, at Target for half the price.<br />I bought both colors. The black is basic and the &#34;black-green&#34; is just your normal dark green. Nothing exceptional about these sweaters and as I stated, the fit is just &#34;off&#34; from what is pictured.",0
5,Good price,1
3,bought for my brother in law for christmas. these run small! very thin  fabric. good for summer nights- i end up wearing them since they're small for him.,0
3,"The dress is pretty, but I guess my 36c chest is just to small for the top. I was popping out of it. It was snug everywhere else, but there. I no way could face gotten away with wearing it.",0
3,Took this dress on vacation from the beach right to happy hour and dinner.5,0
5,It goes perfectly with so many of my tops.,1
5,My husban love this wallet is sou cute,1
2,"The plastic bag came ripped up, and the white stains won't even wash off. Looks like it was a returned item or something. I have no time for a return now so I'm just going to keep it but honestly was disappointed.",0
1,broke within 1 week of purchasing.,0
1,Love this bracelet and only wear for special occasions. The second time I wore it a stone fell out. Unfortunately I cannot find it‚Ä¶ so I guess it‚Äôs not made as nicely as it appeared to be. An even exchange would be wonderful‚Ä¶ we will see as I have not asked for it yet‚Ä¶ fingers crossed‚Ä¶,0
3,"Stylish, moderate light protection. I have a somewhat large head, so they are not comfortable",0
5,these slippers are very comfortable and cozy.. the only problem is that because of the knit material everything catches on them and I mean everything.,1
5,The charm is bigger then I thought and so is the chain. It is pretty but the skulls are view able. It is a nice long necklace for you to wear with a turtle neck or a dress. I really was very please with it.,1
4,"These aviators are very nice quality. They are sturdy, they don‚Äôt slide around on my face when I bend over as some sunglasses do.  The only issue is that the glasses are difficult to return to case- they will only fit in one certain direction. I remedied this issue by using an old case I had from a previous set of sunglasses.",1
5,Fast shipping and great price,1
5,I loved this anklet.<br /><br />I say loved because I did lose it. I credit that to fastening it wrong that day. I will be reordering. Absolutely beautiful anklet.,1
3,"Looks nice, got a lot of laughs from clients and co-workers. Big drawback was the material doesn't breath well and at a job where I get warm and sweat, it gets funky quickly. Doesn't feel too warm, despite that.",0
3,"I like the material and the braided straps and detail... but it is WAY too small!!!<br /><br />I am 5'5&#34;, athletic 125#. I wear a size 0/1 jean so 25/26' waist. My bust is 34c. The medium is too small on both the top and bottom. The top fits more like a sports bra where it kinds squishes your boobs to your chest.<br /><br />I might be able to fit into a large, but they don't offer other sizes, at least that I can find.",0
2,"Wanted to love them- but as I stand a little under 5‚Äô7 these are ridiculously short on me. There‚Äôs no way I can leave the house in them- unless there‚Äôs an actual flood happening. They‚Äôre also too big, I‚Äôm athletic 140lbs. Just weird fitting all around.<br />Bah.",0
3,"Tight around the head area when trying it on , and little tight but its comfy n cozy if it was a lil bigger",0
5,Ordered a size up. I am a medium and ordered a large. Cute little dress for the office!,1
5,"Absolutely beautiful and such quality to be handmade. It even came in a satin overwrap to store it in so it stays clean, my husband loves it",1
3,They are cute and look like the picture but the iron on is thick so the shirts lay weird.,0
5,This shirt is made of very study fabric it is also soft and not to stiff everything you would want in a nice flannel shirt with a tartan pattern. I got this shirt for my son and he loves it. The shirt is fitted of the sides so it looks slightly dressy not like the average cheap flannel he didn't like that at first but likes it now. I like that fact that is looks a little more formal and it is made very well.,1
5,Exactly the perfect mini rosary,1
2,"I ordered a 20 inch chain and got an 18 in.  I also ordered 1mm.  I am not a jeweler, however. I don't how it could be any thinner without breaking.  The price was very reasonable, so I am keeping it",0
5,My child loves this water shoe. It is the perfect fit and is super cute!,1
2,"looks plasticky and cheap.  I like the idea and design of it, but when it arrived, it literally looks like colorful plastic tabs!! If the plastic were a different more durable looking material, then you could play it off as an adult woman, otherwise it looks rather juvenile and something for a tween to wear. i love costume jewelry and other pieces by this vendor, but this one is a no go for me.",0
1,Be careful - item is smelly and has been worn before -it‚Äôs used . They cut off the tags . Clearly you would have tags on a new dress item . Not happy .,0
5,super great!! a lot of compliments,1
5,Bathing suit is gorgeous. It fit exactly how it was supposed to.,1
4,üëåÔºÅ,1
1,Item to small. It isn‚Äôt true to size.,0
3,"This dress is beautiful but definitely sheer, I have yet to find the perfect slip to wear under it but I am going to keep looking.",0
5,"They should change the picture for this watch.  It looks like light green, but it is silver.<br />I do like the watch,  but was a little disappointed when it didn't arrive as shown.",1
5,Too cute üòç,1
5,Toasty head ahead for the winter!,1
1,Worked for one min then something broke inside.  Would not stay running no matter how much watch was worn or shook.  Own several automatic watches.  This one is not so good.  Returned for a refund.,0
5,wife loved it,1
3,"The olive green is more of a mustard green color and the fit it tight , way too tight for me. I like compression but it‚Äôs more squeezing.",0
1,Broke immediately.,0
5,Beautiful!,1
1,Material was cheap and way too thin!,0
1,I thought the dress was going to be way cuter than when I saw it. The fabric is a little stiff and not that soft and the seams were not very secure on the top. I am 5'9 and the shirt puffed out too far for me to feel comfortable wearing out to a wedding.,0
3,Not exactly in love with this dress. I‚Äôd say it runs small. I didn‚Äôt notice that the chiffon part of the dress goes to your feet while the non-see through fabric under it only goes to your knees or so. I preferred both layers go to my feet. The top of the dress is a little uncomfortable because in my opinion it runs small. I‚Äôm hoping that if I continue to lose weight I‚Äôll like the way it fits.,0
2,Hood was put on backwards. I only have 2 stars because I recieved it fast.,0
3,It's very cute but the size runs small,0
5,Amazing!! Super cute I love them,1
1,I was so excited to get this dress.  I had never worn anything Christmasy but thought it would be awesome this year.  I did not wear this.  Did not fit correctly.  The waist was about 3 inches above my actual waist.  Shoulders were not comfortable.  The skirt was not as dramatic as the picture shows.,0
1,Texture of the material is awful. I will never wear it.,0
1,"Returned, too thin for my needs, I was looking for a warm fleece.  Suppose it would be great for others.  I returned it.",0
5,They're adorable and holding up well after a few months of use. Got them for my seven year old and they fit perfectly.,1
3,This set of shirts was about two sizes below what the recommend size should've been. The material felt soft to the touch but unfortunately I donated the shirts to Goodwill because they were way too small and not worth the effort to ship back.,0
5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Nice poodle figure, not cartoonish. Easy for me to convert to lever back earrings for my customer.",1
3,"Very cute boot, super uncomfortable after wearing for a few hours",0
5,"I have been going to sleep a happy woman these past few night and in part is due to this new pajamas. Absolutely love how soft the material is, feels great on the skin. The design is also cute, the white Lacey portion on both the pants and the top. I am 5‚Äô3 and it fit perfectly. After using it for a few days, I washed it and it did not shrink nor did the color wash away.",1
5,"These glasses definitely outperformed the other 5 I tried.<br /><br />Multi Focus that didn't cause eye strain plus blue blocking. You can look up from your computer and easily use your normal vision without having to take your glasses off. With being on the laptop or computer a lot, the blue-blocking feature was important. The earpieces can fold against the back of your ear keeping the lenses tighter against your face and maintain the focal strength.  Trust me, give them a try.. you will like them more than your normal reading glasses.",1
4,"It's more grey than silver.  I was expecting a bit of sparkle, which this doesn't have, but otherwise it's nice.",1
2,i am going to return this.  it turned my finger green so I know it is not really white gold plated.  major let down.,0
5,Stellar Shirt!,1
2,Not great fabric - WAY to small - I ordered my usual size (large)and it is skin tight<br />It shrunk even more when washed - would not recommend,0
1,Garbage,0
1,"It doesnt fit properly, material is thin.  Barely resembles the stock images they sell to us.",0
5,This was so cute and comfortable.,1
5,Works good with key fob.,1
1,I ordered an extra large and it's more like a medium. Good thing my sister is more like a small than a large as she will be the new owner of this sweat shirt.,0
2,"I'm sorry to say that I have buyers remorse. The waist is so tight that it's like a corset. It hurts my back when I put it on. A lot. The bra does not cover enough area. Side boob should not be exposed in a sports bra. And where you would like control, in the thigh area, there is none. So, it's tighter everywhere than where it's supposed to be. I know that women want to be sucked in in the waist area but this I'm concerned will actually hurt my health. I don't even have a tricky body, so I'm very confused as to who/what the model was for this design. I'm sure this is a lovely company but I've bought much much higher quality workout pants at Walmart. I only wear these when I have a workout wardrobe emergency and I should stop.",0
4,"This is a nice ring. It has a good weight and feel, and it is a good width. It looks like a quality ring, and as a tungsten it should hold up well.  The little CZ on it gives it just an added bit of 'pop.'  Feel we got a good value for what we paid for it.",1
1,collar and buttons were crooked,0
3,"ordered two pairs, L & XL.  both were really large, big.  they size chart is either misleading or just irrelevant.  gifted one pair, since it was too big for anyone.  have yet to try the [over-sized L] pair I kept.  quality wise- looks OK.  As in built to last 6 month- year.  Plan to use it @ home and in flights.",0
1,I was really looking forward to this blouse. Fit is good. Fabric is awful! I wore it once and my purse straps made the fabric snag and pill.,0
3,"These pants fit comfortably around the waist and hips, but the legs are much too wide, much wider than what the picture shows.  I found the overall look unattractive.",0
5,Gave these to my step-dad as a Christmas gift.  He absolutely loves them!  Very unique gift that seems to be well made.,1
4,looks like a fit bit.,1
3,Cheaper quality but it isn't too bad. The dome caps stretch too easy and don't stay on your head. The durags are OK but not the best of quality. They don't rip but they feel cheaper and thin thin.,0
3,These do not have the neoprene uppers like in the picture.,0
3,Very tight compression sock!,0
5,Love it and i love the color,1
3,Top is a little small bottoms seem regular sized. Very cute.,0
1,Cute but feels very light & cheap.,0
3,It's cute and does the job well but does run a tad small,0
3,Looks very professional but the zipper doesn‚Äôt stay up. The material is very soft but grabs to leggings.,0
1,"The handbag inside made from a very cheep material, zipper was broken. Usually Jeep has very good products but this handbag made in china. Not recommended",0
3,Very vibrant colors. Fits a little weird but good for a coverup.,0
5,Good,1
1,"Shirt fit great and very cute, sadly after washing it according to directions the print has peeled up off the shirt. Completely ruined now. Be nice to get a refund or replacement",0
2,Fine,0
2,"I bought 4 of these scarves in different patterns.  They look like the photo, but are a synthetic satin weave.  Silk is a material that can come in many different weaves: chiffon, plain weave, twill, or satin but it is a monofilament made by silk worms.  ""Silky"" of ""Silk like"" is a feeling from a satin weave fabric that can be made from any material.  Most people don't know the difference between ""silk"" and ""silky""  The ways to tell the difference, is in the washing.  Silk wrinkles badly when washed, and absorbs water.  Synthetics repel water and hang dry almost wrinkle free.  If you burn a synthetic, it will curl and melt, like a plastic.  If you burn silk, it will burn smoothly and not curl or become hard, and it will smell like burning hair.  These scarves are beautiful, but they are NOT made of Silk.",0
3,"The actual product for what it's worth isn't bad. Not great, but not bad either. The wristbands are rubber which is a little uncomfortable if you wear it too long (if you have hairy forearms like me). But the real thing that disappointed me was the way it connects together; it's easy to put on but gets difficult to put on, especially with one hand.<br /><br />On a personal note, once it arrived I looked closely at the scorpion-symbol inside...now it looks more like a lobster to me. I can't hold that against the product just wanted to share that.",0
5,wonderful item and quality is great,1
5,I bought these for work and it took a while for my feet to get adjusted to the shoe but once they did They were perfectly comfortable and also a great workout shoe,1
2,This runs extremely small.  I wear a size 8 US women's.  The x-large was still too small.,0
1,They were enormous and looked weird,0
4,"Love it, my old one broke after about 6 months heavy use so I picked up a new one",1
1,Was way too short to be a dress! Had pantyhose looking runs down the front of it! Returned it!,0
4,Its shape make it difficult to put it on.,1
2,Either the advertising is incorrect or these are mis-marked. My father wears a size 10 shoe and these socks were literally impossible to get on his feet.,0
5,"Looks like very good quality has nice lining,  LOVE this purchase  Not SUS at all....",1
5,"Good price, fit well",1
1,"Don't Waste Your Money. I gave this pair of shoes to my kid on christmas. One week later, the left lights are not working. I'm very disappointed, that was the only gift that he wants, and we have to wait so long to have them cuz we live in South America.",0
2,Doesn‚Äôt really look like the the photo. Shiny leather looks fake/cheap. Crown was mashed in Shipping so it is permanently deformed. I‚Äôm disappointed.,0
4,"nice and good quality, but too long for my wrist",1
2,The way the straps did not touch the top of my husband‚Äôs foot,0
5,I enjoy the feel of the shorts.,1
1,The sizes are about 5 sizes off!  Contacted the seller and they said they would send out a different size‚Ä¶.Tick Tock Tick Tock‚Ä¶Nothing ever came.,0
5,"With three daughters, I only hope I get to keep this great bag!! May have to get one for each of them for birthday gifts.",1
2,The product got torn after less than 10 use.,0
5,I get so many compliments on these earrings! They are bright and fun but not too big.,1
2,"The mask doesn't look anything close to the picture!  You should be ashamed of yourself!  This happens all too often with Amazon these days; as an investor I am disappointed.<br />Why can't sellers be held to a higher standard?  The plastic is thin, not ""PVC"", and the gold paint and detail of the face itself is not even close to what is pictured.<br />Thanks for wasting my time and making me return it for $17.",0
5,I love the Mickey Versa Lite band!  It‚Äôs leather and the colors are vivid and bright. It seems like it will be very durable and last.,1
3,The blue is for SW planes. I the first time and it worked. I tried to use it again on another flight and it did not work. I'm taking another trip in a few days we will see what happens.,0
5,Cheap looking,1
3,"It was not really what I expected, but it was still a nice swimsuit cover.  I wished it had been a little more true to the size I was buying, but otherwise not too bad.  Just remember to order it a little bigger than you really want to have, and it should fit fine.",0
1,The dress only can fit six years old I will size small I guess I just give it to somebody else !<br /> Fits little girl maybe 13 years old but she still need to wear T-shirt underneath it does not look like the picture !,0
3,24 months fits like 18 months. Shirt faded after one wash in cold water & dried on low heat.,0
5,This was really super cute,1
4,"The watch band looks good, but feels really cheap. You do get what you pay for. It looks cute and dressy, good for formal days.",1
1,Will not run.  I have replaced the battery and it still will not run.  Very disappointed.  A total waste of my limited funds.,0
5,"Very comfortable, great walking shoe.",1
2,Nice band but the keeper rings broke off in several weeks.,0
2,Way too much polyester content. Otherwise it's a cute shirt.,0
5,Fit as expected,1
3,"Very pretty when new but it will shrink, and it will wrinkle. I would not put it in the dryer more than a few minutes and let it air dry. Then you‚Äôll probably want to iron it. Too much work for a nightgown.",0
4,"I bought this as a gift for a friends lingerie bachelorette party & she loved it! Decent product for the price. No rips or anything upon arrival. It is a see-through lacy crotchless romper, very revealing, & serves its purpose for ‚Äúsexy dress up time‚Äù. She is a C cup, curvy frame, petite at around 120lbs.",1
1,Was excited to try it on but it was too small was upset since i was really looking for new leggings.,0
4,Great size to wrap my hair like I want.,1
5,I really like these mask. It is protective and breathable. It is also comfortable on my ears. Great value.,1
5,"This onesie is so comfortable. My dog thinks I'm a dog when I wear it, but I'm okay with that lol",1
5,Good shorts for the price. No complaints!,1
3,"Cute, but not well made. Watchband came apart and had to be reglued.",0
5,I love it!,1
1,The front clip to this bra came broken. It was snapped.,0
2,Ordered this hat/scarf/mask set because liked the idea of the built in mask. Well it just came in the mail and there wasn't a mask in the bag. Hat fits good so I'll keep it. But disappointed the mask wasn't included as advertised.,0
5,I bought this one size up thinking my 2 year old could wear it for a little bit. I probably could of stayed her size. It was not SUPER big but she will be able for this year and next year.,1
3,Would be a better buy if pin clasp were stronger. Adding a place to make it a pendant would make this an exceptional buy because the colors are wonderful.,0
3,Pockets are awkwardly high. The one thing I really hated about it.,0
4,I got these for my son because he is solid but they were too big for him. Still nice jeans though,1
1,"Broken within a week, won‚Äôt order again",0
5,It was a great gift for marvel lovers,1
5,"This two pack is great. One for me and one for my boyfriend. The quality is the best I've ever had in a rag. Usually go to my local beauty supply or if desperate, Walmart, and those do not compare in quality to these from Amazon. Pretty durable. I also sleep in mine and it stays on pretty much the whole night.",1
3,Cute but too tight,0
4,super cool famous people glasses.  also love the case it came in.,1
5,Good color texture and luster very thin should cost $15 @ the most,1
5,Nice,1
4,"We purchased two small and two large &#34;IT Luggage World&#34; suitcases to replace older, worn out luggage. The items are lightweight indeed and came w/a ten year limited warranty which was reassuring. We were taking a transatlantic cruise from Miami to Rome and then flying back to Miami. The lightweight pieces were perfect for helping us meet Alitalia's weight limits for carry-on and checked baggage. All four pieces survived intact which included the gentle ministrations of baggage handlers at the Port of Miami, the two airports and an 11 hour flight. We are very pleased with this product. The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that this was only one trip...we shall see how the bags fare as we add on miles.",1
3,They are okay.  Like the color but there wasn't any support for the arch that I needed.  Otherwise they are great.  Returning them.,0
5,Son loved it,1
2,The shoe fits fine but the quality was not as expected.  I've had this maker's product a few times in the past and this particular model of shoe does not reach that level.,0
1,Size runs large.,0
5,It's a great product... Fits me perfectly,1

3,"Would never buy this coat again unless you put in a stronger zipper. For this big heavy coat they put in a zipper that is more appropriate for a thin sweater. What a waste of a perfectly good and warm coat. Don‚Äôt want to return coat again because zipper will most likely break again. Also, because zipper head is so small, it‚Äôs difficult to get it zipped up. I bought a size bigger than I actually wear because wanted to add more warm clothes if needed under the coat, so zipper did not break because it was too tight. If you put in a stronger and bigger zipper let me know. Right now just plan to throw the coat away because am tired of dealing with it.",0

5,"I really wanted this bracelet, but after reading that it was hard to put on, I was skeptical. I'm average-sized, but I wear a size 11 on my ring finger; saying I am big-boned is an understatement. ;-) I went ahead and ordered it because, for the price, I could always give it to one of my waif friends as a gift. It DOES have a smaller opening that no one could just slip their wrist into, but it is also pliable enough to bend a little and put it on. It's not super-heavy so it snaps right back into shape. Conversely, it's not so thin that it will break. This works better for me anyway because I am a salesperson and use my hands a lot in presentations. I really don't like loose bracelets sliding around and and banging on my wrist. This piece is elegant and sleek-looking. All-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase.",1
1,"I purchased a pair in May of 2018, and seemed like a great deal. Within a few months, the supposed Extremely Light & Unbreakable frame snapped right behind the lens when putting them on. The company sent me a replacement, and fast forward to this week and the replacement pair snapped in the same place. So in a little over a year, these unbreakable frames snapped twice in the same place.  I am not rough on my sunglasses, I only wear them when driving, and to break like that is inexcusable. I think you better change your description as its falsely advertises the quality of these sunglasses.",0
5,love it! Turquoise is my favorite summer color  and it fits my outfits.,1
2,I found these glasses to be very thin and they had flimsy frames. In fact the frame of the sun glasses broke while wearing them the first time. It's also too bad that you have to buy a 4 pack of glasses and get 3 regular pairs that you don't want or need just to be able to get the magnified sun glasses which were a disappointment.,0
2,"**update** this shrunk horribly after washing, I probably would have preferred getting an XL as opposed to a medium. I can‚Äôt even wear this now it shrunk so much.*** Does not necessarily look like the picture, definitely not floor length and I am 5‚Äô2 so it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm tall. But it works for me, it‚Äôs a nice rip length. I liked the bunched look of it tied in the back, seemed like it would be nice and baggy, which it is to a point, I can‚Äôt really bunch it up and tie it, it just ties and you don‚Äôt get that look, maybe I got the wrong size I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 130lbs and this is how the medium fits me. I‚Äôd be afraid to go much bigger though because it fits perfectly across the chest so idk. But I like it enough.",0

5,Have bought Russell sweat shirts before in a one X LRG size.  Arm length and general fit was perfect but a little short coming only to my waist.  Thought a two XX LRG would be better but I was wrong.  Sleeves (not wrists) drooped down several inches and bottom extended mid-thigh or slightly above.  Returned and bought my single X LRG as I LOVE RUSSELL SWEAT SHIRTS (including the hooded models).,1

1,"I bought this to wear for my birthday, but (fortunately) it arrived much later than expected and I didn't get to wear it.

I plan to wear this dress on vacation soon so I'll def take pics in this little number.",1
3,Not a fan. I ordered a medium (my normal size) and it was way baggy. But the fabric stretched out a lot. Would recommend ordering down.,0

1,I was very happy initially with this band however after only 4 months of wearing this band the back of the band is bubbling up and oxidized. I am really disappointed in the quality of this band especially after spending $20 on it. I will not be ordering from them again.,0
3,Kind of tight.,0
3,It's not what I'm expected.,0
2,"First of all, based on the picture I thought the bottom fit more like short boy shorts, which is why I bought it, because I wanted more coverage.Turns out it is just a regular one-piece, no boy short bottom or extra coverage. It also looks like the bra cups are way too big for me and for the size of the swimsuit in general (I ordered a small), but I'll never know because I couldn't get the swimsuit on past my thighs. The torso is too tight and not stretchy enough to fit over my thighs without breaking threads, and my thighs aren't that big. Maybe a medium would have fit better, but I was worried about the bra cups being too large if I didn't order a small, and I usually buy size small clothes anyway so I didn't think it would be too tight. It is a cute suit otherwise, but that does me no good if I can't wear it so I am going to return it.",0
5,Beautiful,1
5,Very nice looking .  My 14 yr old absolutely loved it.,1
5,Is nice I like,1
5,Love.  So soft.,1
5,"I just ordered these as a novelty item, but I have found they actually have a ton of practical uses!<br /><br />I keep the o-ring on one to use as a conventional grappling hook, and I have the o ring off of the second one to use as a gravity hook. I read the reviews of all of the people who said how amazing the functionality of the gravity hook is, and it absolutely is amazing. Anything you drop in a tight or hard to reach space, as long as it is small enough to fit in the width of the jaws snd it has something to grasp onto, you can tie the gravity hook onto a shoelace or piece of string and lower this and grab your lost item. If you drop your car keys behind a couch, refrigerator, down a shallow sewer grate, etc, as long as you can fit the gravity hook into the amount of available space snd you can see the object, the gravity hook can drop down, open up, and, as the name implies, gravity will cause the claws to close snd grab your item to lift out.<br /><br />The regular grappling hook is great for getting a frisbee, kite or radio control helicopter if it gets stuck in a tree. Just tie a light rope or fishing line to the hook, throw it up, and keep trying until the hook snags your item and can pull it down.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt hunt, but a friend of mine does. He was telling me about this harness system some hunters use to climb a tree which is an alternative to a conventional tree stand. It‚Äôs kind of like the rigging a telephone pole lineman uses to scale a telephone pole. He said one of the things you need to do is throw a light rope/ line over a tree branch that is high enough up the tree and then use the lighter line to pull your heavy duty rope that will support your full weight over the branch so you can scale the tree. This seems like it would be perfect for that application also.",1
2,had it for a week and the strap broke.,0
4,Chocker is a bit too big but overall it was as expected,1
5,Great looking dress but too small so I had to return it.,1
5,So cute!! Perfect size,1
4,The material is a bit see through but nothing a slip couldn‚Äôt fix. This is a very classy skirt and can be paired with many different colors which is what I loved most about it. Quick delivery and no complaints besides the material being a bit thin.,1
3,"I'm 5'3 and it fits as expected, but definitely not quite the look and feel I was going for. I was expecting fashionista super model deluxe and I feel like a hospital patient. However, it is a cute dress that fits as expected.",0

3,"I really like to organizer box. Came with plenty of batteries, some odd sizes that I hope will not go out on date anytime soon and too few of the two most common types that I have had to re supply.

3,It's not chiffon its silky definitely not what I expected but still very cute,0
3,"Don't get me wrong I like the product the pendant looks cool, nice structure and design but the reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it is way smaller than I thought it would be not to mention the pendant/rope is too short, for example you can increase the length of the rope but even when I did that there is still a slight struggle to get it around my neck.",0
2,Cheap material a few bends and it leaves crease's all over. You get what you pay I guess I recommend getting a size bigger because the shoe runs small,0
4,Good quality for the price however they run a bit small,1

2,"Definitely smaller than I really needed.  Nothing wrong with the bag's quality, just not sure its very practical for anything.",0
5,So comfortable! Planning on ordering more.,1
3,I‚Äôm giving this 3 stars on behalf of my husband. We purchased these for him to work out in under his gym shorts. The problem is that they are made for people with no butt. It barely covers him up so they slide down a lot.,0

5,Awesome!!!!!!! Wore at the jingle jungle 5k at Disney world,1
3,The dress is cute but a few heads up. First off this dress isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúanti-wrinkle‚Äù as it wants you to think. The bottom definitely wrinkles. Also if you read threw the profile you find TWO different descriptions of what material the dress is made from. However for the price the dress is still good quality and it‚Äôs lightweight for the summer which was exactly what I was looking for.,0

I would've gave it 4 stars. Consider not folding the bag when packing to ship.",0
4,"Great gi! They run big, even after washing and drying. I'm 205ibs at 6' 1&#34; and I'm swimming in the A3... Go a size smaller unless you're more comfortable in rolling without pants, because they will fall off!",1

I love still feeling stylish and dressed up, even in a sneaker. I think these are about the same or more comfortable than my Ecco sneakers.<br /><br />The only reason I docked a star is because they don‚Äôt hold up well with constant use. For example, I just took them on trip for a couple weeks and they were the main shoe I wore so, they look pretty sad now - the glitter starts to wear holes and the top pulls away a bit from the sides - but the sole is still solid. Also, since they are so sparkly, you don‚Äôt really notice unless you look closely... I would think that wouldn‚Äôt be much of an issue when they are in rotation with a lot of other shoes. For the price, I still love them!<br /><br />I wear a 9.5-10 and the 10 is perfect for me.",1
4,"The frogs are cute, but they look like they are for children. I like my silver frogs better.",1

1,"never should have ordered this, its cheap and the elastic is weak",0
5,"I got what I was expecting; it looks the way it does in the picture. The only small drawback is that the credit card/ID pockets are made such that you can't see the back card, as the front card covers it up. Usually on wallets the back card pokes up above the front card a little so you can easily see and access it, but in this wallet the front and back card are almost on the same level. You can fit 8 cards at a time, which is fine because behind the 4 card pockets on each side of the wallet, there is an additional back pocket for extra cards. Also there is no ID card pocket with plastic front so it can be seen without removing from the wallet.<br /><br />However, this is a very minor issue to me, and I don't mind not being able to see the back card; just that the wallet would be ideal if that were the case. The elephants are adorable, the zippers work well, the coin pocket is great. All in all I'm very happy with it, and I like it much more than anything I found in the mall or at Target. The price is excellent for what it is.",1

You don't notice these things till you snap the cuff twice. Mine is a snap model.<br />On second use, the left sleeve cuff on the right sleeve, snap pulled right out of the material. With both parts. I tried using a pliers to clasp the snap base to the cuff material, got part way there, and the second snap in bit went in. Unsnapping pulled out  the snap base along with the snap in piece. Right cuff is totally useless. Note all my technical terms in this paragraph :-)<br />It IS warm. Until the rest of the snaps pull out and it becomes a dog bed.<br />I think my complaint about this purchase is that nothing in the item description said it was made by some other company I'd never heard of. Woodland Supply, in this instance, is just selling Chinese junk clothes. The tag still in mine says &#34;$79.&#34; I paid $24. There's a lesson.",0
5,"It a bit baggy, I hate using the word baggy but you have to know thats what the dress looks like in the pic.  I got a small and I am 5'5 and about 134 lbs. and I got a small.  It fits perfect though not see through and the pink looks just like the picture. The pockets are AWESOME and I love that its not tight.  Its very comfy and you can dress it up or down.",1
5,"I love these 92% cotton & 8% Spandex--no fleece pants!  The title description says ""sweatpants"" which is misleading.  I almost didn't look at them because I wanted a nice heavy weight cotton jersey pant but did not want fleece. They are the perfect pants for gardening in the hot Tucson summer but nice looking and substantial enough to wear shopping, doctor's office, etc.  The pants wash & dry beautifully.  I now own 5 pairs of these great pants.",1
1,Just printed paper glued behind glass. I thought it was something I could fuse in my glass kiln.,0
5,Love this keychain and the metal it's made of is very strong. Nice heavy keychain that doesn't seem like it will get too worn down over time. Very happy with this purchase.,1
4,OK Stuff,1
3,"These slippers are really cute, but we were disappointed with their sizing.  My daughter uses a size 1, but thought I'd order a size up, since she likes to use thick socks during the winter months.  Unfortunately the size 2 was too small and even with thin socks her toes were rubbing at the tip of slippers.  I'm assuming these were not even standard size 1.  Unfortunately a size 2 is their biggest...so we had to return them and opt for another style.",0
3,"I would recommend buying at least one size up- I wear a 30 in jeans and these are very snug to say the least. These have no stretch whatsoever. The waistband stretches about a quarter of an inch. They are very restrictive. On the plus side, they do look really good and are very comfortable once you squeeze into them.",0
5,"I love how this dress fit on me, had me looking like a whole snack!",1
4,Easy to put on and take off. Fit like it was supposed to fit.,1
1,I was very disappointed when I recieved this bracelet broken didn't get to wear it for my birthday,0
5,Good hat and as described!,1
1,"Disappointed! 4th time ordering these shorts in a different color because they fit me really well. However, white shorts arrived with 20-30 brown dotted stains down one side. I‚Äôm not sure if the stain will come out after washing, so I‚Äôm returning. Recommend the black, camo & green, but cannot recommend the white due to poor presentation / quality.",0
3,"Watch is likely good quality, but finish makes it look cheap.<br />The sanded stainless looks like plastic, the glass is flat, ... design wise not great.<br />It worked out of the box, plain and simple.<br />I you are not looking for this as a a fashion item, go for it.",0

2,Print isn't as nice as picture.,0
1,Too small,0
5,Perfect! Exactly like the first one I bought with my last fit bit. I love the fact that the band is adjustable and the magnet stays in place. I bought it in silver and black.,1
5,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loved it. He put it on display on a shelf and all of his friends compliment him on this set. A few of them have also purchased this for themselves or as gifts for new members.,1
3,"They look nice, but they are to small. I seen they come in different sizes, but I wasn't given the option to check the size I wanted when I placed the order. Now I feel like I wasted the $8 plus shipping",0
5,These glasses are pretty call. I get compliments on them all the time because they are so unique looking.,1

3,"Cheap material and barely fit my wife after some modification, was not happy the way it fit",0
2,It looks really comfortable but in real after receiving it there is no free movement for your hands as the lace fabric is not enough to raise your hands. It also is too big the pants if your a smaller body frame looks like a pillowcase over your body. It unfortunate the design doesn't flatter.,0
3,Se puede usar solo en cabello corto,0
5,So great and so cute!!! Totally going to get other styles!,1
1,Soft pot metal and falls apart in a few days. Pretty to look at but not wearable. I had to give at least one star??? Don't waste your time.,0
4,"Product description says ""super soft and stretchy material.""  Instead I would describe it as a rougher Tshirt material - one that isn't that soft nor stretchy.  Says to line dry which I am not sure why - tag states it's a mix of polyester, spandex and bamboo fiber, which shouldn't shrink(?).  Other than that, I do like the green color and the cut is nice.

3,"I have worn this jacket only three times for a combined total of only 2-3 hours. I only wore it from my door to the car, from the car to my office and back home, but it looks worse than the 8 year old jacket I replaced with what I thought was the perfect jacket.  It is pilling all over and looks worn out.  I really loved it when I got it - -  the perfect length, front zip, hood, and a great color, been looking for these combined features in a jacket for a long time so I am so disappointed,  otherwise would have given it 5 stars.",0
4,"I gave it a 4 because I got a 3x, and when washed it did shrink a little 2x would have been to small if it shrunk as well.",1
5,Love them,1
2,"I would never have purchased these, if I realized these men shorts were handwash only. That is crazy for shorts they are going to work out in.",0
5,"Timely arrival. Packaged well and most important the print and fabric was better than expected, especially for the price.  I LOVE them. I am a solid Small, and thy only offer ""S/M"" which is marked as ""M"" on label.  They run a little small. If you prefer a loose feel, then get larger size of what you normally wear.",1
2,Way undersized compared to the sizing chart. You would need to buy about 2 sizes larger.,0
4,This is so cute and the charm is adorable.  The only complaint is that it irritates my neck at the end of the day due to the stitching on the break away.,1
3,"I really wanted to love this watch - its nice looking, and feels great on the wrist. Unfortunately, the blue color is lighter than shown in the picture - it's practically baby-blue. A darker blue would have been better. The watch functionality is awesome - if you've never had an analog Casio, you should try this. If it weren't for the color, this would be a 4- or 5-star review",0
1,I had these for approximately 4 months and then the lens started fogging up. Totally unwearable after this starts to happen. Save your money and look elsewhere.,0
1,FOLLOWED INST. TO THE LETTER.......SPRAYED 5 SEC. AND QUIT.....DO NOT BUY ...REAL TRASH......WOULD NOT BE A GOOD BUY IF THEY WERE GIVING IT AWAY.....,0
4,Shorter then expected,1
3,Looks super cute. Ordered for one-time wear which was perfect for the quality. Only problem was the dress kept riding up and had to be constantly pulled down,0
5,AWESOME..LOOKED GREAT AT MY FUNCTION!,1
1,This necklace looks terrible.  It‚Äôs supposed to be sterling silver.  I take it off every time I take a shower.  I can return it and I would like to get my money back please.,0
4,Not really like the picture but it is still great!,1
3,"The sizes are WAY WAY off!! A mens X large is closer to a women‚Äôs small, especially the sleeves as they don‚Äôt even reach the wrist area, otherwise nice thick construction and good warming.",0
1,These were WAY smaller than I thought they would be.  I can use them for lower arm support.  Legs?  Not so much.,0
5,"Perfect size and color. Simple and classy. Keep in mind that it is a clutch, so it's not going to hold alot, just the bare necessities, but it is lovely. I'm very pleased.",1
1,Chain was broken and beads fell out. Cheaply made,0
3,"I've only had this charm for 1 week and it looks like it's fading a very light blue color. The black and the 'foil' look is almost gone. I don't take my Pandora Snake bracelet off, so maybe this has something to do with it. It doesn't seem to be holding up with everyday wear (water, showering, etc.), but it's not worth the hassle returning so I will keep it.",0
5,love it.,1
5,"I have worn this dirndl twice for two performances with a Houston German singing club. I have received many compliments. The one that I received is made with quality fabric, and has excellent details. I bought two because I wasn't sure of the size. I ordered a 14 and a 16 in American sizes. The 14 was probably the correct size, but I felt it was too snug for my personal liking so I returned it with no issues. I kept the size 16, which  may be too big because the blouse kind of moves around. I have not sent it to be cleaned yet but the instructions say it doesn't have to be dry cleaned but It can. I've worn it in 80 weather and it didn't seem to be too hot.",1
5,Nice bracelet for the money!,1
2,Disappointed.  Very uncomfortable for a sandal that  is supposed to assist in supporting and comforting your foot issues.,0
1,I ordered and received these masks but the description is totally incorrect because they do not have a filter pocket which is why I bought them in the first place!,0
2,"I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn‚Äôt this. It‚Äôs a shiny, really smooth texture like plastic. Not like a regular sweatshirt!",0
3,"Se ve muy sencillo, lo compr√© para regalo y no me satisfizo, no lo recomiendo es sumamente peque√±o. No le doy menos estrellas por consideraci√≥n a la empresa que da muy buen servicio.",0
5,These are well made and cover the area nicely.  Like the slide-in pocket for filters and the colors are nice.,1
5,Love it! Had compliments &amp; saw someone else with different color. Very pretty,1
1,fell apart in a week,0
5,I'm wearing one now I like it,1
5,Great shirt! People like it as much as I do,1
3,Fabric is lightweight and mediocre quality compared to other terrycloth robes of a similar price.,0
2,Too short and didnt have pockets.,0
2,"Not a comfortable material and seems to run small.  Material is much thinner than expected.  I am 5'4 and it is much shorter on me than anticipated.  The ""waist"" falls just below my bust (the picture is very deceiving).",0
3,"I ordered a size 10 at first, totally my fault, I thought. Returned it, ordered a size 9.  Ring is still at least size 9.5. As a result, have to wear it on my middle finger.  I still love the design, but will have to get something else for my wedding ring.",0
5,Very comfortable and don't fade easily.,1
5,This dress is perfect. I wore it to my daughters wedding and had so many compliments. It‚Äôs high quality and fits true to size. I am 5‚Äô5 and weigh 148 pounds. I ordered a medium and it was just right. I was able to bend and move with no problems and this dress is lined. I highly recommend this seller. I will definitely be buying more from them.,1
5,I loved it!!!!,1
4,They are cute and fit well but they are slippery. Since the shoe is shinny they are a bit slippery on the sole on hard surfaces.,1
1,strap broke while wearing it the 2nd day.  Don't waste your money,0
3,way too small actually - gave them to a granddaughter (A little granddaughter).,0
3,This dress was much longer and a little larger  than I expected and haven't been able to bring myself to wear it yet.,0
5,Super cute and easy to pair with outfits,1
4,"Soft fabric,  Just as pictured.<br />UPDATE:  April 2018 - A THE LACE FABRIC IS SHREDDING BADLYt.  Too bad cuz its pretty and has a nice feel.",1
1,"Clip missing,hole at top, plastic exposed, Total piece of junk.",0
3,Thought it would be a different color. . It's okay.,0
2,"The description says it fits babies 0 months. This is false, it‚Äôs huge on my 1 month old. I would recommend these hats for babies 1 and up.",0
1,Poorly made,0
4,Great product. Will definitely purchase again,1
5,"Excelente, buena tela queda hermoso",1
1,Did not like the fabric. It was stiff. I do not recommend.,0
4,"I purchased this as a nursing top and for that purpose it worked and looked great. The fold across style also worked for snuggling up the baby close to me while sitting together (although of course it doesn't function as an actual baby wrap).  From a general style point, the bottom of the sweater was somewhat small and it rides up all the time, which I don't love.  Aside from that it looked nice and the price was right.",1
5,Got my wallet earlier than expected.  Love it!  Good quality.,1
2,"In terms of the purchasing experience, I was very happy - the items shipped and arrived very quickly.  I enjoyed the black bag and cloth that came with the glasses too.  However, the quality of the glasses themselves honestly feel very cheap.  The lens quality seems ok, but how they attach into the frame is very loose and they click back and forth very easily.  It honestly looks like the slot in the nose piece where the lens sits is about 2-3x as large as it should be, and I even noticed the glasses rattling when just sitting on my dashboard.<br /><br />I contacted the seller informing them of the issue and they were extremely understanding and offered to refund my money or send another pair.  I opted for the second pair, but upon delivery, they have the exact same issue.  It feels like they are cheap snap-together glasses as they creak and groan and don't have proper lens slots in the frames to feel like they are worth this price.",0
4,but such a good look,1
4,Oretty,1
4,This is very cute and comfy.,1
1,This dress STUNK!!!! Like literally!,0
5,Have this dress in  3 colors. Love the fit and fabric. I am 5'5 and it falls below the knee. It looks very classy. There is an invisible zipper in the back. The bow at the nexk is stiched so it won't move or hang over.,1
3,Order a size up. Otherwise great product,0
1,"It arrived broken. I know I didn't pay much for it, but I at least expected to wear it once......",0
3,I wasn't a fan of the material. I don't like when it stretch it has that shiny look to it.,0
4,Never got the sandals they didnt have my size was disappointed.they was so cute.and the price was very good.,1
2,"Where to Begin, so I got this in the mail today on time, no problems or anything so far. I opened it, nothing was broken or appeared to be out of place. Inside was a smaller package for the eye-pro itself. To my delight, everything was safely protected in a very professional looking case. The smell of cheaper plastic should have been a warning sign for me. I unzipped the pouch and pulled out the eye-pro itself, I left everything else (5 more lenses, back strap, instructions and cleaning micro towel) inside. The Eye-pro felt cheap and the lenses felt like it'd break if I tried to take it off to switch it. The frames looked flimsy like dollar store-grade plastic, which threw me off a little. I mean, for 20 dollars, I could've gone to walmart and bought a pair of durable regular sunglasses. I legit went to a knife shop and bought a 6 dollar pair of shades that would last longer than these. The aesthetic of these is great, they probably do work for their intended purpose but I don't expect these to last too long, especially if they fall off while you're using them. I've probably spent over 400 dollars buying new pairs of ESS Eye-Pro (200 dollars per) and I decided to spend my money on these as a substitute for expensive eye-pro. All in all, I gave 3 stars for functionability, if they were more durable then I'd feel better about them. So you get what you pay for and please, treat these like a newborn if you buy them.",0
2,"Not great quality, priced accordingly. Clingy...",0
2,I purchased another long dress (red/white/blue) from this company and it fit perfectly. I am 5'10. This one (in a different color) was much shorter for the same dress and not the same quality of material.,0

1,"I ordered one pair of slippers. What came in the box were mixed matched styles, which were also two left shoes! How disappointing for the person I gifted them to and embarrassing for me.  I wished I could add my photo here.",0
1,The quality of the top was actually nice but the top part resembled more of a square neck then what was advertised. Not like the picture at all‚Ä¶,0
4,Expect long shipment times. It took over a month to get here however I read that prior to ordering. I ordered my normal size. I ordered 2 colors and they fit great! Enough stretch but keeps you sucked in at the same time. They are a thick material that isn‚Äôt sheer at all.,1
5,Love these pants! Super soft & comfy & breathable. I do recommend washing them before wearing (which I normally do but spaced it) as they were a little stiff in the thighs for my run but great after washing. Can't beat the price too- ordering more pairs now. I ordered an XL & for great.,1
2,was not true to size. I ordered 1 size larger then I normally wear and it was still a little snug.,0
5,Fit my boyfriend great!,1
2,I feel the rings included too many large pieces,0
5,"Comfortable, good design. Very attractive.",1
2,"Brim not as big pictured, and not shaped as well but mold as you wear it. Crocheted, a bit small. Would not waste money on it, live and learn! 2 stars is generous",0
3,"These are really cute, but REALLY uncomfortable and gave me terrible blisters on my toes after a night out. okay for a night out here and there. I'd suggest ordering for an occasion since they're a good price.",0
2,thick and uncomfortable.  circles are embroidered into sock and leave circle marks on the leg.,0
3,The blouse is pretty cute but the size was S and it fits like it was M or L,0
2,While many stated this product was long enough and checking the lengths they would have fit but found them to be shorter than advertised when wearing.  I ordered up a size based on previous feedback as well.,0
3,Very pretty. I like dainty jewelry but I was surprised at how small the lotus actually was.,0
2,"pretty junky, the plastic wrap on the arms starts separating in a couple weeks.  I only use these as spare glasses for the car now.",0

5,"Gorgeous. I'm a US 13/15. 5'7 approx 180 lbs. Curvy.  After looking at all the pics people posted I decided to order a size I never buy... Small! Fit perfect, sits just off shoulder. Delicate wash line dry. If I had ordered a size bigger it would've been way too baggy",1
2,too small,0
1,"I guess these socks aren't as great quality as I thought.... I just received them 5 days ago.... wore them once, and I see the lace is already pulled apart from the top of the sock!

These are junk!",0
1,Does not stay closed when passport inserted in holder.  Adding credit cards and money will just add to not closing problem.  Description of item indicates there would be a snap closure.  Online photos are accurate though showing no snap.,0

2,"Material is comfy and a bit stretchy, which is nice. There is a raised seam around waistline that‚Äôs cuts the dress off, as if it now needs a belt to cover that. It‚Äôs semi flattering but too long.",0
4,"I am a size 9.5 women and the XL fit perfect in these. i haven't had the chance to wear them anywhere but in my apartment but they feel like they would be great for a little added support and grip around pools and waterparks. very minimal, flexible tread on bottom and a spandex like material that covers your foot. i think the size chart would imply i should buy a large, because i wear a men's 8, but that would be too small. i would go by the European sizes in the chart another reviewer posted.",1

1,Way too small. I'm 5'4 and 155lbs and I purchased an XL. It's so tight it fits and looks more like lingerie; especially since it comes with lace straps. Giving it to my niece who's a size 0.,0

5,I love these slippers.  They are so comfortable and keep my feet really warm.,1

2,"Too hot because it is double sided.  Zipper shows and stands out.  Too long.  Best part is that the material is great but would rather they not see it together.  I have one that isn't sewn such that it has two layers of material, just one, and it is way better if you just need light warmth.",0
5,I ordered two of these neckalaces for my 15 year old twin boys and they loved them. They actually look real.,1
5,PERFECT! LOVED IT! EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AND EXPECTING. ARRIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED.,1
3,"The shirt itself is cute, although a little bigger than I thought it would be. But it‚Äôs soft and comfortable. My biggest complaint is the color. It is not bright red, as pictured. It‚Äôs more of a pinkish red. I‚Äôm still planning to wear it, but I wish the color was red like the picture.",0
4,"Runs a little small, but good quality. Did not fit my body shape as hoped though so will probably return. Worth a shot to others as material and stretch are great. Shipping was pretty fast.",1
2,It was missing the 3 crystals in the front and the ribbon trim on the tutu was unattached. Unimpressed,0
1,"These are made incredibly cheaply, even after sanitizing them multiple time before wear they cause a reaction in my ear. The 'gold"" also rubbed off. Very disappointing.... Would give 0 starts if I could",0

5,Awesome shirts,1
3,"I ordered this in a medium, and although I am small chested, I found it to be extremely tight in the chest band. It will stretch slightly once you have it on, but I would recommend sizing up.",0

1,"Look at the picture of the clothes,  not the model.  The pants are not at all fitted and look ridiculous. The shirt was similar,  but the neck hole was huge and almost went down to her belly button.  Can't even tell if it's the size i ordered since the tag and the listing are completely different.",0
5,Handy and comfortable,1
3,"This is a nice shirt, however the problem is that the buttons and tabs are placed too low on the sleeve (below the elbow instead of nearer to the biceps. The tabs hang out of the sleeve when the sleeves are not rolled up. You cannot use the tabs to roll up the sleeves because you can only turn up the cuffs once or the tabs hang way below the upturned sleeve. I am going to try to remove the buttons and tabs from the shirt and hope it does not tear up the fabric. The fabric is a gauze like material and is very sheer, so one needs to wear it as an overshirt.  All that said, I still like the shirt itself but the manufacturer needs to remedy the design flaw.",0
2,I'm petite.  the width is fine.  Not all petites are skinny as all get out.  Many of us are under 5 feet and under 130 lbs.  I took your product to the cleaners to be altered. As usual.

1,"I gave it one star because it is leather . Too small for anything other than 1 credit card , my license and a few dollar bills . I guess you could put it in your coat  pocket if that‚Äôs all you needed to carry . Didn‚Äôt serve the needs of the person I gave it to and he gave it back to me requesting something that could accommodate more .",0
5,love it!,1
5,"I bought the orange in this sweater - really nice deep color. It has a very loose weave - much like a retro 1980's sweater look - exactly what it I wanted. It really is loose as advertised, so don't order bigger if you want it loose, it already has that look.",1
1,"When I first got it, it broke the second I took it out of the package. It's poorly made and is clearly super breakable. I would suggest not buying this item.",0
3,Good,0
5,"I was really stoked after these arrived in a very slick looking package composed of a shrink wrapper, encased in a clamshell box, that slipped into an open ended sheath cover with a heart shaped cut out. Boxed In a beautiful matte midnight blue color this is an ingenious gift presentation that intrigued me right away.  Different and modern.<br /><br />Looking at the photos you can see where these earrings fall on a small framed person. The tourmaline color is vibrant and exquisite,  the stones have a very natural crystal look with milky inclusions appearing in places throughout the 4 of them.  Those stones are divided with a clear, round and tiny stones of cubic zirconium.  The  geometric shaped cyan tourmalines are enclosed in .925 cage frames where the prongs secure the stones in place solidly.<br /><br />I think that the stems could be a bit more substantial in gauge/hardness of the metal‚Ä¶.I feel they are too soft and should be surgical stainless steel as opposed to sterling silver for hardness sake.<br /><br />The silver is beautiful cohesive in color with the setting as a design choice , but for me just a bit too soft.<br /><br /> I feel I need to handle them with extra care so as not to bend the stems or accidentally break them off.  Be gentle and store with care and everything should be fine.<br /><br />My earrings were noticed and complimented on right away.  I wore them with a darker monochrome outfit and with my darker hair their gorgeous turquoise colored stones seemed to glow even more.  I‚Äôm delighted with these earrings‚Ä¶.so elegant and chic.<br /><br />If this review was helpful to you please click yes in answer to the question below ‚Äúwas this helpful?‚Äù  Thanks!",1
1,"When I received this necklace and earring set I was very unhappy with it because on Amazons web site the red in it appears to really be red, but when I received it it appeared to be brown instead of red.",0
5,So thick and warm and soooooo soft in the inside!! Love it!!,1
5,The purse is so beautiful the perfect side not to big not to small I am so glad I order the color is amazing.,1
2,"Very cheap frames with the most basic plastic hinge (just a screw). The arms slick plastic on the arms allow them to slide around on your ears. If they get too close to your face, sweat and grease accumulate on the top of the lens. The mirrored lens looks cool but the purple to green color shift on mirrored lenses is also noticeable when looking through these glasses. Nice that it comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth as well as a bag as you're likely to need to both to keep them clean. Bulky (as I anticipated) but quality is lacking",0
5,"Originally I had gotten to 00g when I decided to take my gauges out and let them heal up a little bit since I had graduated with my Bachelors and I wanted a more professional look. After 6 months, I realized that my ears didn't quite close up completely, but that I could thankfully get away with a very small gauge at my desk job. The problem was that I didn't know what size I am now! Getting this gauge kit made figuring that out so ridiculously easy. Each size taper and tunnels are individually wrapped and labeled the correct size, technically fool proof. Turns out I've gotten all the way down to a 4g!",1
4,"I love these cute little earrings. They are comfortable, somewhat heavy and even better in person. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that when I received them a few of the posts were slightly bent but, I straightened them with no problem. Very happy with my purchase.",1
3,It is comfortable but quite oversized.,0
4,The gloves came with holes in 2 fingers.  I didn't realize until I arrived at my party and put them on.  Dress was great - fit perfectly and had a great swing to it when you shimmied!,1
1,This is not what They say it was not a good product,0
3,"I bought size 8 and my feet slip sideways in this.  The arch is really high.  It does help my foot pain, but I'd never wear these out of the house because with the slipping sideways due to the odd way it tilts my feet, I'd be afraid of tripping.  Mtn Dawg fits better.",0
2,Very small and not great quality. For the price should come with a chain. Returned.,0
5,"Great stretch!  Good buy!<br />Love these! The fabric is phenomenal. Super stretchy, but still with great support. I wasn‚Äôt sure of size & just took chance on the M. But little tight in the waist (gut), & they were super short (not a huge issue). I think I‚Äôd prefer a L. I don‚Äôt expect them to be much longer. But they are not so short that they look unbecoming. I am going to try the L.  I lost nothing on my sizing error (Yes, it was my error-not the manufacturer nor Amazon). I just gave to my granddaughter. Great fit. She loves them!",1
4,"Attractive watch. My husband loved it until he started to develope a rash around his wrist. Not saying others will have the same experience, he may just have a sensitivity to the materials this was made out of that we weren't aware of. It really is an attractive watch, though.",1
2,It is the real color but it's just 20 bucks instead of 6:50.,0
5,"This is a very nice sweatshirt! Heavyweight, nice seaming detail and attractive enough to wear ‚Äúout‚Äù. My 20 yr old son is happy with it.",1
1,only good thing is the robe is the right length for my 5 feet height.  useless without a belt.,0
2,"I don't know what world this is an extra small,  but I don't live there. I'm 5&#34; and 95lbs and this is a tent on me. After receiving this item and trying it on, I looked at reviews and saw that an extra small fit someone 130 lbs. By no means is that an outrageous number but it's just not an extra small.<br />The fabric is nice and the dress itself is so cute. I just wish I didn't have to get this fitted now.",0
2,Loved it until after washing it a few times. The material got really itchy.,0
5,Fits as expected and seems to be good quality,1
4,"Very comfy, my son loved them! Like the hard bottoms.",1
1,"Don‚Äôt buy, I had it a day and the band broke.  It‚Äôs a game as it looks great and was easy to use.  Good news is Amazon took it back and refunded my money.",0
5,"I can not say enough about the quality of this product, I was so impressed when I took it out of the package. This dress does run a little smaller in size. I also had to return one of the dresses, as I ordered 3, couldn't believe how easy that was. If I ever need another dress for a special occasion I will definitely be looking on AndyBridal first. The only draw back is the amount of time to receive the product, but the quality is worth the wait.",1
5,Love this dress. Bought it in every color which I never do. My mom even took one of them and won‚Äôt give it back haha. They are much more beautiful than pictures and fit really wonderfully.,1
1,"One size did not fit, these are for very small men's hands.",0
2,"Fits weird. Maybe it‚Äôs my body type. Top was too large and bottoms are short. I have very large boobs so, read measurements and hope for the best",0
3,"Very cute, but the sizing is off.",0
4,"I love the look and the fabric, but the fit is a bit weird, even if I wear them very low on my hips the pant legs are still above the ankle, wish they were a bit longer",1
2,gorgeous amber but tiny pendant. I mean almost child size too small.,0
5,These leggings are amazing! Soft as butter and they fit perfectly. For the price I feel like I stole them! Lol.,1
5,Love this dress! It's fits great! I am a Medium in shirts and a 4/6 bottom and I ordered a Small and it is excellent! In need of a little ironing and it will be ready to go!,1
3,"I make/sell tote bags, so I've worked with many different brands. I have to wash the bags before I can apply my HTV.  After washing, light brownish/yellow stains appeared along the top (fold) and on the panels on 8 of the bags. I washed a 2nd time they ate still visible.  I can hide the stains on the panels, with my designs, but not the discoloration along the top.  I will never buy this brand again.",0
5,"Item is as described by others; nice clingy fit, soft material, strings may be moved to the front or the dress may be worn in reverse to allow strings to tie at back.  Feels nice to wear.",1
1,"These broke after only a few days - the elephant broke free from the base. I emailed the company asking for advice on how to fix, and they didn't even acknowledge my problem, just pushed me off onto Amazon. I just want to know how best to fix them.",0
5,I bought 2 of these in different colors as gifts for Christmas.  When I got them I wished I had bought an extra one for myself  They are beautiful.,1
1,"1. item came a day late<br />2. the picture is not reflecting the item; you are getting an impression which is overstating the feel of the item<br />3. the color of the bracelet is not as dark blue as the picture suggests<br />4, the plastic of the bracelet feels raw, and unpleasant on the skin<br />4a. the ergonomic Perlon bracelet feels real cheap<br />5. the pin for the pin buckle closure is too short, so you will have a hard time to close<br />6. The clock stopped on the second day I am wearing it.",0
5,Really great! I got them and it comes with a thank you note from the seller for buying.,1
5,Love the sailor suite!  My grandson looks so cute in it!,1
5,They are very well made and easy to adjust.  Now if I could just get this busy toddler to wear them.,1
1,Don't like it at all.,0
1,I wore the earrings for not even an hour and one of them broke.,0
4,I was skeptical with getting these but they fit perfect! Even after being washed I did not have any issues with the quality. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 190lbs and got a extra large I usually would wear a large and went a size up.,1
1,"Hated this shirt, if that's what it can be called. The fabric is horrible., never seen anything like it. Threw it straight into the trash. Extremely disappointed.  Deserves zero stars.",0
1,"I've been happy with all my amazon purchases but this one sure wasn't one of them.  It looks nothing like the one pictured, looks very cheap.  Won't be wearing it.",0
3,OK,0
1,Broke after a 4 weeks and is just a crappy sticker on the back,0
5,"great product very soft and comfortable, just what I was looking for.  Delivery was timely.",1
4,Keep knees and legs pleasantly warm! Plan to order a second pair,1
5,"Being very picky, I was very pleased with the quality of this pretty bracelet. Easy on and off, just fun to wear.",1
1,I only gave this one star because it broke the first time that I wore it.  I ordered the orange one it was very cute. I had planned on purchasing this in two more colors. I‚Äôm glad that I didn‚Äôt order them before I wore this one.,0
5,The dress fits perfect love the fabric and colors,1
5,I love this outfit I just need to loose a lot of weight first!,1
5,Excelente,1
2,"The outfit in the main model photo is actually made by &#34;Body Zone&#34;, not accurate with the product that is listed.",0
4,I like the  product jus thought I would of got it sooner.,1
5,The kids loved the bracelets. Thanks you,1
1,Color faded really fast,0
5,Wonderful!!!!,1
5,These gloves are great. Flexible.,1
3,Cute swimsuit!  The top was too small but the bottoms were just right.,0
2,"These shoes are well made, comfortable, and durable. However, only one shoe lit up- even after fully charged. The company was very kind and apologetic and immediately sent a brand new pair. But that pair did not light up at all. So beware of that. If you don‚Äôt care about the lights then it‚Äôs a great pair of sneakers.",0
5,"I needed a convertible sports bra to wear under a maxi sun dress. The fit is great. I get the coverage and support I expected. I also ordered it in black from the same company. I hope to also see how hold up in a workout session (i.e. weight training, walking/running, and tennis) too",1
2,Half these collar stays were way too long to fit ANY shirt I own.  Not sure what is the point of including these huge stays.  Maybe the vendor expects a sudden return to 1970's-style giant collars?<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the stays themselves... except that I had to throw away half of them since they were a useless size.,0
5,very nice,1
5,Perfect replacement.<br />Leather is nice and thick like the original.<br />We‚Äôll have to wait and see about durability but so far it‚Äôs a winner.,1
5,"I was skeptical about giving this as a gift at first, but it is actually awesome! The sound quality is great and is perfect for morning runs or when we are out shoveling snow. The only thing is that I wish that they came in different sizes, as the one we received is somewhat small for my fiance's head. Would definitely purchase again.",1
5,Gotta love Disney!fast delivery,1
4,Very useful.  Little flimsy but so far 4 mons really working great.  They get reality dirty but work great,1
5,"I love it!  The background is antique looking but the colors are bright and very pretty.  It has writing on it in what I think is Latin that makes it look even more interesting. Nice fabric, well sewn.  I would be happy if I had paid 4x the price.",1
5,"Nice material, great loose fit. This is soon to be one of my favorites, and I will probably buy it in other colors.",1
5,"Love, love, love these.  Wasn't sure whether to get L or XL. Delighted to find that the L is a perfect fit. Nice, thick fabric with a good stretch. Not transparent. Mid calf length on me.",1
1,"Bad quality, no branded tag. Doesn‚Äôt look like picture",0
5,The smallest one was a pain to get unscrewed but they were all in good condition and don't bother my ears.  You may need some help putting them in.,1
5,My husband loves these! Not shiny like pictured but was perfect.,1
3,Came very wrinkled<br />Is very thin cotton. Just ok. Zipper is decent.,0
3,Beautiful colors but scarf is a square and can not be wrapped around neck like a traditional scarf.,0
1,Cheap material with no give. Sized way too small,0
5,Kool and comfortable,1
2,I like these because they‚Äôre stretchy and have pockets. But they‚Äôre too big on me and too short and they seem to get baggier as the day goes on.,0
5,Grandson loves them. Has them on all the time,1
5,"This case is so good, I just bought another.  My phone fell out of my pocket while riding my bike yesterday and only  the case cracked. I watched helplessly as the phone violently tumbled on the street.  When I looked at my phone, I expected my screen to be cracked. Instead, only the case cracked. A $10 case instead of a $300 phone.<br /><br /> I have also gone swimming with my phone in my pocket and again, no damage.<br /><br />Great case and great value.",1
5,These were all more classy then in the picture,1
1,"Do not buy! Within a day 2 bracelets popped and broke, and are unable to be fixed. Worst of all they are tarnished after 2 says! I haven't wore them in any water. I rely wanted to love these and for them to match my rose gold cuff bracelet.",0
4,They worked perfectly with the band.,1
1,The white tassels came apart after one wash and caused a disaster!!,0
2,"Runs very large for the size! I ordered a Large, I'm 155 lbs, 5'6, 36D breast & I looked like i was a balloon in it! Luckily the return process was very easy.",0
1,Didn‚Äôt work for the Ambit 3. Short on one end...,0
5,This fit just as expected based off of the other reviews given and the sizing chart. They were very helpful. I still use this robe after my wedding day and I love how light it is.,1
5,It's lovely. I've worn it several times and some always comments on how pretty it is. I love the burnt orange color with the blue. It has a nice weight to it.,1
5,"Already have the tropical print dress and this pink and stripe is great too! The dresses by this company definetly impress, they are light, not see through and flowey!",1
5,I got these for my daughter who loves smiley faces. They were true to size and she thinks they are comfortable. She loves them!!,1
5,It was a xmas gift she loved it has had lots of good  comments.,1
5,Great item - plus included two threaders,1
1,I wear a 2XL & their 2XL was too small,0
5,My Grand baby love it,1
5,The PJs are wonderful! So soft!,1
3,Cheaper looking than I expected.,0
5,These are great. I have really cool luggage that I want protected from baggage handlers. I traveled to Europe this summer and no damage sustained,1
3,The slipper feels comfortable but it feels like my foot cant go in deep enough.... it doesn't come up high enough by the back of my heel besides that it feels good,0
2,"Adorable print and good fit.<br />But after washing it's a crumpled, wrinkled mess!<br />I haven't ironed my uniforms since the 1980's and have no time to do it now.<br />I have older Tooniforms which are in excellent shape so I'm really disappointed.",0
5,"Good quality key chain, very nice and solid. I love having it hold my keys where I can see it every day. Super fast delivery too!",1
4,"Looks good, great for biking.",1
2,"Great suit but 1st time I wore it, back tie came unloose in a pool of 100 people.",0
3,Not for me. Fabric was very thin,0
5,very high quality. looks great.,1
3,"I ordered ""10.5-11 W/9.5-10/M"".  I wear size 10.5 women's shoe and 9.5 men's shoe.  NO WHERE NEAR THAT SIZE!! MAYBE a 10! Yes a size 11 foot is supposed to measure 11 inches.  Shoe from China and marked ""280mm"". And yes 11 inches does equal 280mm.  However size 11 DOES NOT mean 11 inch INSOLE!!  An 11 inch foot needs more than 11 inches INSIDE a shoe!! Really angry that I have to return these with no option to get an appropriate size. They were soft and warm. If you wear a smaller size go up - way up: if you wear 5.5-6 do yourself a favor and get the 7-8. Then you'll have room for fluffy socks.  SAD face.",0
3,There nice but a bit big.,0
5,my wife loved them and they look perfect with her watch bands,1
5,My teenager looks beautiful in it! and arrived earlier than expected. tks!,1
2,A little exspensive for what it was.,0
3,The upper part of the gown (sleeves and Neck area) are a good size. However the gown is a bit too long.,0
2,these rosary beads are beautiful everything about them are beautiful except the fact that they turn after a few wears. my rosary beads got a little wet and started to rust very very quick,0
2,TO BIG OF LENSES!!,0
2,"Decent quality and sizing is fine if you have short arms and short torso.<br />Not meant for anyone 5' 7"" or taller",0
5,Once again All the ladies like to ask where I get my kicks from I simply say amazon today's my birthday but I'm partying tomorrow so I'll definitely be rocking these,1
5,Me gusto la calidad del producto,1
1,"The headband comes untied so you have to tie the now yourself and it looks stupid. The shorts come up way too high and my 3 month old was swimming in the onesie. Overall, not impressed.",0
5,These socks are the best ever. They are just perfect for the low cut boots so that you see these cute socks instead of regular socks.,1
3,Kept feet dry<br />Way too small,0
5,Very soft fabric and fits great. I‚Äôm usually a small but needed a medium.,1
4,"Prior to buying these I had bought two masks from SockFancy which I loved but I was looking for a cheaper alternative. In that sense, these masks were great! They have a very similar design with adjustable ear straps. Yet, my biggest complaint for these masks is comfort; the material is very stiff and uncomfortable, especially when wearing for more than an hour. Also, these masks tend to muffle your voice more than others would; in normal mild volume settings they function well, but I work in a louder environment with children which makes it harder to communicate.",1
4,Warm abs nice looking,1
5,Nice for the price. Lots of possible style choices through the seasons.,1
3,After washing lost a lot of the length.  If you buy this- line dry.,0
1,"What a POS! This looks nothing like the picture advertised, I can't believe I paid $20 for this after shipping and handling. It's the ol switcheroo once again.",0
5,So Cute !!!!!  Must be patient on shipping time.,1
5,Good quality. My 4 year old has it on his backpack.,1
5,Bella,1
3,Runs small,0
5,Stays on ALL day with every type of shoes! Great buy,1
3,Pretty and different- but I even exchanged the sizes and the Top portion fits so awkward. Can‚Äôt wear it :(,0
1,"Too small, I couldn't even get them closed around my earlobe.",0
1,Hated this sports bra- clunky and ugly,0
5,These glasses look cute but I am returning them due to my baby not liking it lol she gets annoyed if I put them on her.,1
3,"The stone toe rings are great, but none of the flower toe rings would fit!  The flower toe rings have a clear plastic loop to go around your toe and all three loops were so big they would only fit on my big toe with no way to adjust!",0
2,Not happy. It wasn‚Äôt comfortable. And the lights did not display as I thought it would,0
5,Love it,1
1,Fake,0
3,Love them but I‚Äôm 5ft 2in and they were really long,0
5,Perfect gift.  Very high quality,1
3,"The reason why I gave these only three stars was because as far as using them for stretching they were absolutely terrible. 99.99% of the time I never have problem stretching to new size when using Stone. And these seem like they're real enough Stone. However that being said, there's a pretty nasty dip where the O-ring sits and if you're going up a size that could mean a blowout as ended up meaning a minor blowout for me. They're really cute my 1 year did all right with them but that dip on them was absolutely terrible and for that reason I ended up returning them.",0
5,....just what I wanted....beautiful color!.....WEPIIIIIIII,1
5,"Bought as a gift for my best friends fianc√©, exactly as advertised! Looks great even though I‚Äôm not a penguins fan! It sold out when I first found it, but I made sure to snag one for the restock!",1
4,I love the hiding pocket inside the cap.,1
5,These were the hit gifts by moms attending BD party as well as the girls. Love the packaging:). My granddaughters absolutely loved and loving every day!  Well doneüëèüèª,1
3,"Beautiful color, love the fit, flattering. Material is thin with loose knit easily pulled.",0
1,"It says it's machine washable, but . . .  I bought a large and washed it before I wore it and it shrunk to maybe a small!  I can't return it so I guess I can wear it to bed????",0
1,[[VIDEOID:6428476383e822b48f1ac81f78c328a3]] Highly disappointed! I ordered WHITE AND GOT BROWN. I really needed the white...<br /><br />Material is awesome but I got the wrong color... Am got to give it to someone..,0
1,"I usually wear a small or a 4,6 in clothing. I ordered the small and there was no way it was fitting. I then exchanged it for a medium and that too was too small. I ended up just giving up and returning it all together rather than ordering for a 3rd time.",0
5,Just what I was looking for awesome fit.,1
3,Returned easily for refund since they were too small,0
5,the size are a little bit smaller then the chart that i pick out of so i would have just pick that out if they had informed me that they run smaller then the size given,1
5,Great jean great fit,1
3,I have bought medium sized gloves for 50 years.  The gloves fit everywhere except the fingers are about 1/2 inch too long.  Your hands look like alien hands in them.  I didn't return them because I can wear them to the barn.  Horses don't care about what your hand look like.,0
1,Garbage - too tight to fit over the arm - the end of the arm could not fit though and snapped off inside,0
3,"These are comfortable shorts but they run large.  The zipper is very cheap and won't hold up too long, just received them and zipper already doesn't want to zip correctly.  I would not buy again.",0
2,I thought I was getting sweatpants style shorts. These are the shirt thin. I normally wear a medium/large in bottoms and got a large and the waist is SOOOOO tight it feels like it could be a small or xsmall on the waist. They are a good length and pretty cute but I'm not able to wear them. Shipping also took a long time.,0
3,Love this nose stud it‚Äôs dainty. And opal is my birthstone. I would rate a 5 star only if the L was longer since its fallen out a few times already. Was going to purchase other colors and styles from you But will wait and see if suggestions etc are taken into consideration from your buyers,0
4,Worked well for what I needed them for. However the gold ribbon bows are cheap and started to unravel when I tried washing them.,1
5,"At first they‚Äôre a little firm and I was a little worried but once I started wearing them my goodness they feel like clouds. I would definitely recommend ordering a size up. I will definitely be getting these in every color they‚Äôre perfect for wearing after a really good work out or walk. I love that you can fold them and they just pop back up, like they‚Äôre brand new. Another great thing about these slides is that when you wear them on the rocks, rocks don‚Äôt get stuck in the bottom of them and that‚Äôs a major bonus for me.",1
1,Not what I expected,0
5,very pretty necklace. seems to be good quality.,1
3,Braclet just fine. A major problem with removing links so can make smaller. The tool they sent to remove the links very cheap and stem broke trying to remove a pin.. This was a valentines present to my husband. I am taking it to the jewelry store today and get the 2 links out so will fit him. I even watched the video 3 times how to remove the pins. The braclet is very pretty. Just problem with removing the pins.,0
5,High quality. Came in good condition.,1
1,Turned after a couple of weeks of using it. So disappointing. I loved this ring,0
5,"My daughter's left ear lobe was having a hard time healing because her ear lobe was swollen. After replacing her old earrings with these long post and continued cleaning, they started looking so much better within 24 hours. Highly recommend.",1
5,"Very well made, stylish shoe for my husband that spends most of his time in sneakers or hiking boots.",1
2,Buckle to big will not go through levis belt loops  Nice bent though.,0
2,it is not like the picture.,0
1,small in the wrong places... large in the wrong places... large in waist... small around thighs....,0
5,"Wife loves them. She picked them out and wanted them.  She loves them so far, Im glad because they were $$$.",1
4,"Only giving 4 stars because it was missing 2 rhinestones, I still love it!",1
5,Cute and stylish. Would recommend buying.,1
5,Gorgeous earrings! Very pleased with purchase. The item arrived as promised.,1
5,"My neighbor had me order this night gown for his wife, cause she had looked everywhere for the brushed back soft flannel, like, lining.  He said they have looked for 2 years! And of course, I found it right here on Amazon for her.  He told me she was so surprised when she got it, & it was exactly what she had been wanting. The silky outside, & the soft, warm, & cozy inside, night gown. And it also fit! He said it was pretty too!  I bet he will have me order her another one come Christmas!",1
1,Lenses aren't as shown in the picture. The glasses I received have dark blue lenses not light blue.,0
1,These didn't fit at all and were not comfortable üòï,0
1,BOTH of mine have all the wording backwards!  Don‚Äôt understand why they would make them this way.,0
5,I love it. I'm definitely gonna want to buy a petticoat to wear underneath to make it fuller and look lifted. I bought a large for a just-in-case if it didn't fit. But it stretchy to the point I could've ordered a medium lol it's just a tad bit loose. But it's cute,1
2,This item did nt cost very much and I could see why when i received it. The bracelet band felt tinny and un-durable. The hands on the face had a lot of give in them when I attempted to set the watch. I really wanted to keep it because I didn't pay much for it but I felt that the 16.00 bucks could be better spent on something else.,0
4,This pajamas was a gift to my sister.  She said that they fix really great and they are very nice. She recommends them.,1
2,Very cheap looking.,0
5,Great value!,1
1,Canvas wears out quick on these,0
1,Maybe it is the cut but I disliked the item since I opened the box. It did not look good and my wife and son did not like it either. I returned it and got reimbursed.,0
5,I absolutely love these sunglasses! I chose them for the metal frame because I felt like it‚Äôs something different than your normal aviators. The frame is very strong and the fit securely to my face and I really like that. I can‚Äôt wait to wear them out to the beach this weekend!,1
5,Great quality cap. Well worth the money,1
1,These are huge! They look like you are wearing feather dusters as earrings. The quality of them is disappointing. They look cheap and tacky.,0
1,Dress is thin and not really appropriate for a cocktail dress,0
3,"I had to return my shorts after figuring out that a small was too small for me and the medium was way too low due to a small stride. However, I had a great experience with the return process so I am pleased with that, but not the product.",0
4,I loved the color and style especially at the bottom. Unfortunately it  not a fit for a petite woman.,1
5,Loved it,1
5,"These shoes are great.  Fit great, clean easy, and my daughter never complains about them.  this is our second pair and will get more in the future.",1
1,Too small and fits really poorly.,0
1,"I received the bracelet broken,",0
2,"They fit over my glasses fine, and are a complete game changer when it comes to reclining in the recliner, or laying down, and reading my Nook. HOWEVER. The black plastic has a black rubbery paint coating that keeps flaking off and getting in my eyes while I'm reading. STOP PUTTING THIS COATING ON THE PLASTIC AND THESE WOULD BE PERFECT.",0
3,Like the design but the product came with a few discolorations and loose threads. Runs small but for a regular medium you should only go one size up my xl was too baggy,0
5,"Works for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) No more snapping, breaking and causing injury to male body parts.<br />2) The smooth sides of the snaps do not snag on pants.<br />3) The shirt stays using the foot loops, are extremely easy to work with and remove.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The snaps required some minor adjustment or bending for proper tension.<br /><br />I tend to where shirt stays whenever I can, as I tend to dislike my dress shirts getting baggy.",1
2,"its Not purple. The photo looks Purple. There is a Paul Malone RedLine that is Purple.  this one is clearly labeled Pink. Which was my mistake.. its a mix of Pink and Fuchsia.<br />  I own 4 different colors of this tie.  I get the most compliments when I wear them.<br />For the most part all the colors have been slightly off from the photos. Mainly a bit lighter in tone..<br />its Pink that shimmers Fuchsia.  still a great tie, just Not Purple.",0
4,Love the earrings but they're a little delicate. The clasp bends easily.,1
3,Not what I imaged.  Lenses are way to big for my face,0
4,For the price it is a great replica.,1
1,"Not worth the money, thin material, very big and looks like a costume",0
5,"This looks stunning.  Very well made, nice craftsmanship.  Beautiful work.",1
3,It's small like the size of a nickel,0
3,"They are beautiful,  but they break within a month and beads go everywhere. I've bought 2 or 3 in the past.  If you could somehow make them stronger, they would definitely be 5 stars.",0
5,"Amazing absolutely loved it! Goes well with a pair of jeans and boots. I definitely recommend!!! Nice quality, good price, I could go on but you get the point...",1
5,The colors of the stones are great.,1
4,Great product and meets my needs.,1
3,"The top of dress runs small.  After wearing it for a day, I noticed the sides of the dress had ripped. So if you have A or B cups you will be fine.",0
5,"The shoes ran just a slight bit large but the spacers included to offset that did the trick pretty well.  They shoes themselves are like waking on clouds.  As a type 1 diabetic with a bit of neuropathy, I can say these are the most comfortable in the home slipper I‚Äôve ever put on.",1
3,Too small order up a size,0
3,"I love the magnets, it weighs down the chain so it hides in my shirt but they both tarnished rather quickly.",0
1,They don't look anything like the picture. I immediately returned them.,0
5,"Absolutely love them!!! So light, you forget you're wearing earrings! Will definitely purchase more from Humble Chic.",1
4,Unfortunately had to send back due to the size. Loved color and quality though.,1
4,"I love the shape and the pattern but the loose form on the bottom half is not reciprocated on the shoulders and bust, where a zipper could make the outfit easier to put it on. I was afraid it would tear or I would get stuck in the outfit, it took some work to ease in and out of it. But overall, I loved it. Just a little bit snug.",1
5,good fit and comfortable,1
3,These are very small which is deceiving by the picture.  I wanted to return them but they are not eligible for return.  Waste of money on my part since they are to small and you cannot get them on.  They do seem well made.,0
3,The stones are too small. Not happy.,0
1,Ordered a Size up and it's still too small.,0
5,"sturdy rosary, i am always having them come apart, but this wooden twine type is great",1
5,Great. Simple.,1
1,Like the item fine just sizing was wrong they would not send a return label so stuck with something I can't were,0
5,This is my absolute favorite dress ever! I wore it to my graduation and my sisters wedding rehearsal. Really is just a universal dress that always impresses!,1
5,I got these for my husbands fathers day gift and he loves them. I actually will probably be buying a few more packs.,1
5,It‚Äôs a great case for a child with an Apple Watch. Just put a screen protector and the bumpers are already there.,1
2,It fits great but the problem is it's see through I order the white shirt. Going to return it.  Sad to say I can't wear it,0
4,"It‚Äôs good. The neck thing is a little thing got but I like it that way so whatever. It not that  adjustable, basically not at all actually so be sure what size to buy. As a tip and a pretty big guy-6.2, so I bought a 5xl and it fits nicely",1
2,"I've no idea why this product is claiming everywhere that it runs too small and to order a size up. I didn't size up, ordered the ""Small (fits like XS)"" and it was still way too big on me. I am 5'4 and it was too long, inches dragging on the floor. While slender, I am also curvy (32D) but this had way too much extra fabric bunching and spilling over the cinched waist-line. I imagine it would be even worse for someone without curves.<br /><br />So this dress could maybe work if you ignore the seller's ludicrous advice to size up, are tall, and aren't slender/can fill it out.<br /><br />Outside of sizing, I can also report that the navy color is extremely dark/almost black and that there is no obvious front or back (no labels or tags except on a side seem) so you could probably wear this with the slit on either side. Reasonably thick fabric and felt breezy and comfortable.",0
5,"BEAUTIFULL, EXCELLENT QUALITY AND VERY GOOD PRICE",1
4,"Received this today and while it‚Äôs a cute purse, I was a little disappointed that the chain part is an off gold color. I was expecting a silver color since that‚Äôs how it appears in the picture. I like the space it has to offer and it‚Äôs a comfortable fit. We shall see how it holds up...",1
2,Would def work for no panty lines. As for the use to conceal &#34;camel toe&#34; it's too thin and doesn't work for this use.,0
3,The black wore off after maybe 6 months and the clasp progressively got weaker.,0
3,I like the design but material is cheap.,0
1,Credit and business cards don't fit into slots. Forced a few in and then couldn't get them out. Disappointed.,0
5,I did not like it,1
2,"I bought these for my 4 year old for her birthday party.  A review from another purchaser said it was fine for their 4 year old.<br />They ended up being too big to even fit me. I wear a size 8 in ladies.<br />I tried to return them, unopened. They were going to charge me over $3 to return them.",0
1,"I was exciting to receive sunglasses for 2 year old. What I received after a long wait is something a doll would wear. I don‚Äôt think these glasses would fit any child. Too much hassle to return, we‚Äôll keep it for a doll.",0
2,"It is not a full size sarong and the print is only on one side, plus it‚Äôs a cheap material. You can buy these in Bali for 1 to 2 USD.<br /> I bought another sarongs from this company and they were full sized with a nice soft, strong material. I was dissatisfied with the quantity of this sarong at the price. Patten is nice, but it should be full sized and the absolute cheapest cloth with only one side printed!",0
3,They are beautiful but too small :/,0
5,Nice,1
3,my feet are narrow and i find the elastics too tight considering my feet arent wide. looks pretty on your feet but because its too snug it tends to get uncomfortable in the next few hours.,0
5,Wonderful bracelet have had many comments on how pretty it is.Love the way it fits.,1
2,too small and too flimsy,0
1,I wasn't too happy about what I paid for. It should be less expensive for a cloth mask. I expected better quality.,0
5,"Great Product on Leather, specially designer shoes and Purses",1
5,"Nice material. Flows. Is not see though (I got the cream/tan). I can wear it with jeans or dress it up for work. I ordered a large. I am 2 months postpartum and normally between a med or lg, so I decided to go a little bigger.",1
2,I ordered these for my son an he loved them but after the first day of wearing them his feet were the dirtiest I ever seen. I even tried wiping them down but the same thing kept happening. The strap broke on them also. They are very cheap.,0
1,"Material is heavy and not good quality material<br />The top is little and the bottom is bulky and big, U have to take the whole top off to use the bathroom",0
5,Bought as a gift and she said it fit perfectly and was super soft.,1
3,Nice,0
3,Wasn't what I expected.  Kind of large and the criss cross in the front says. I thought it would look cute and kind of looked matronly on me.  Maybe if I bought 2 sizes smaller it would look better.,0
3,I have a very small foot. I am a size 5 in women and 3.5 in kids. I thought that these would be perfect but they are a bit small. A lot smaller than a size 6. They fit a bit tight. Other than that they do the job.,0
5,Pretty good mask for the price just need to cut it open in some areas,1
1,"Chain broke after 2 weeks.  Spend $30 for jeweler to repair.  Then after 6 weeks, bottom swivel cross broke off.  Cheap quality!",0
5,Beautiful,1
1,Did not receive product that I bought print I ordered is dolphins print received is dinosaurs it also runs large,0
2,The cleats kept me out of the concrete. The heal stop is not tall enough to hold my shoes. I kept walking out of the shoes because my shoe heals would slip over the heal stop.,0
5,Nicely made.  I love it.,1
1,I didn‚Äôt like the material on this dress,0
4,Great except this weird sash thing that came on it. We ended up cutting it off. Very nice.,1
4,I wanted a blue watchband and this watch band is gray.  The photo gives a false impression with the original ad.  Do not order this watchband. if you want blue!!!  Edit:  I just went to the site and they now state that the watchband is gray and the photo is more true to color.  It is actually a faded gray.  Otherwise it is very pretty and I can upgrade my rating.  I did want blue and hoped that this had been as originally advertised.  At least it is true to color and the gray is pretty.,1
5,I love it. Is beutiful blouse is just the way I like the design and colors. I am so happy that purchase this piece.I recommend.,1
5,Good quality product. Very strong magnet on the money clip.,1
4,"Waist is a lil small even with ordering a size up, but not enough that I cant wear it. Light enough so you don't sweat to death but just enough to keep you cozy",1
4,"It's totally cute, looks as pictured. The problem is that it was too large around the waist for me. I'm pretty narrow though that region. If it had run smaller, I would've kept it for sure.",1
3,"OKAY SO: I bought this for the gold ring, which came broken, but the other two fit just fine so &#34;it's okay.&#34; (3 stars, but more like 2).<br /><br />They are a bit hard to open and close so if your nose is sensitive OR you have just recently gotten your septum pierced I DO NOT advise you to purchase ANY clickers online. Instead I suggest going into a body jewelry shop where you can witness an actual person open and close the clicker, as these types of rings can be very difficult to put in and remove.<br />These were alright, at best. I got the 8mm because I like the closer fit to my nose (which does factor in how easy these are to put in and remove.) The silver is cute and the black stands out a bit more. I would have loved to have all 3, since the gold compliments my other jewelry better, but hey, beggars cant be choosers (especially online.)",0
1,Received a turtleneck not a v-neck like in the picture,0
3,Purchased for teenager.  Looks too much like a maternity dress.,0
5,So cute.  Great fabric,1
3,Loved the color and style. It just didn't fit me.  The material seems thin but maybe if had not been a snug fit it might not  have mattered.,0
1,Not at all as described or as the sellers photo shows. Smaller. This is not for a Pandora bracelet. Only a cheap jump ring. Don‚Äôt bother purchasing. $5 item.,0
5,"This shirt is really comfortable, seems very well made, and fits great!  I typically wear a Large and it fits perfect!",1
3,"Weird gaps by the armpits, even with a 34 DD chest.",0
5,"This is my go to summer dress now. Comfy, light, and not tight in the chest.",1
5,Love this shirt! It's one of my favorites. It's very flattering and hides what it needs to in the tummy area.,1
5,"A little on the small side, but a great warm hoodie........well worth the cost!",1
3,"It wasn‚Äôt the best. The nasa logo feels like a sticker and feels cheap and tacky. Also don‚Äôt trust the duration of when your order is going to get here. Mine said June 29th but it surprisingly arrived 1 month earlier and I ordered the white sleeved one. I have to agree, the sizing was horrible. I like big sweaters and ordered a size up. XL. It still felt uncomfortable and was outlining my body a bit. Overall it‚Äôs ok I liked the look of it but it wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting .",0
4,Finally found these! Theyre my favorite!,1
2,"Sending this back made me sad. I really wanted to love it. First, it's cut kind of odd. I have a pretty average length torso and the waist was set way too high which made the top tight and way too low. The material is thin, but not see through. Be careful what undergarments you wear or they might shine through. It was soft and silky, which felt good on the skin and I had no problem returning it when it didn't fit right.",0
1,It broke the first time I tried to put it on,0
3,My daughter loved this for her workouts with me. We bought it a bit bigger so she wouldn't grow out of it quickly.. However the material isn't very stretchy like spandex workout clothes but more like a satiny material with a subtle stretch. The waist band which fit her loosely also ripped during its first wash on a delicate cycle.,0
5,I'm 5'5&#34; and usually wear an 8/10. I ordered the medium and it fits perfectly!! Nice thick stretchy fabric that's very forgiving if you have &#34;problem&#34; areas.  Hits just above the knee. I preferred to wear at a wedding rehearsal.  Will definitely be ordering more!,1
5,Nice quality shirt with great color.,1
3,The dress was beautiful. But too small in the chest. Would buy again if I could,0
5,Beautiful earrings! Great price! Well made earrings.,1
5,So far so good,1
5,Super lightweight woven cotton. I love it. I want to order more. It is great for traveling because it rolls up to almost nothing compared to the Jersey Knits I'm ordering more,1
5,"it‚Äôs adorable, exactly as pictured, perfect for costumes.",1
5,Great style and super comfortable. Most would probably think this runs small but not drastically,1
3,Too small to use,0
2,Button broke the first day I put them on. If u put keys in any one of the pockets your gonna need hedge clippers to cut them out. So many strings in pocket. Seems cheaply made. Would not recommend unless the price dropped to around 12$ bucks or so,0
5,Nice pins. As pictured. Happy purchase.,1
3,Product was cute but pilled and faded after a couple washes.,0
5,this was a gift to my mom and she loves it,1
3,"The compression is spot on, as well as the sizing. However,  the design is raised on the inside of the sock and becomes painful as the day carries on. I really wish there was a way to make a smooth compression sock both inside and out. The clinical stocking are so drab :(",0
5,"great strap, lots of padding, works great for my heavy les paul",1
2,Not sized properly. Returned with no problem,0
3,Put them in wash with no soap at all after one wash color faded completely you can still make out the pattern but definitely faded,0
5,"My 12 year old son received this for Christmas. He LOVES it! It's not to long, but just right for his size (21&#34;).",1
5,Very nice jacket,1
4,Fabric was great I would have bought a size up it is cut small,1
5,Love it fits perfit have a couple colors great for summer,1
4,very comfortable flip flop!,1
1,Cheap looking. Do not order. The quality is not good at all. The bow is flimsy. I was very disappointed.  Order from the Vfemage vendor.,0
4,It‚Äôs not a real pearl but still a beautiful piece. I wear it a lot cause it goes with everything.,1
4,just fine,1
5,Amazing i love it my girlfriend love it thank you so much guys great product!,1
2,"Frames are OK, magnifying power is OK, but they really don't block much computer glare.  I have an old pair of yellow clip-ons that do a better job.  Since I bought them to cut the glare from my laptop, that's a downer.",0
1,"cute, but the stars fell off pretty easily.",0

5,I love this British regal hat.  I can not wait to wear it with some of my outfits.  It is worth the price.,1
5,"These may be a little small for high school kids, I would get these for grade school. I did not open every one, I hope no problems. Corners may be a little thin. Seem worth the price. Next year I will probably spend a little more, and get the bigger size, and order a little sooner, not worry about shipping time.",1
5,Sexy shirt dress.,1
5,"The shirt was a bit oversized, so I would suggest going to a smaller size when in between sizes. Overall though, the shirt is really great quality and the material is super sturdy and great quality. Was pleasantly surprised by this one~ but I absolutely love it!",1
5,I previously had a similar watch that I really liked.  The new watch is more delicate (whick is OK if it holds up well) and the face is smaller (which makes it a bit difficult for an older person to read}.  Overall I'm satisfied with the watch and appreciate the quick delivery.,1
3,Shipment was fast and the necklace was good but the necklace was really short almost like a choker.,0
1,Returning. Fabric is thin and flimsy.,0
3,"Beautiful ring. Review update.  Initially I gave it 5 stars.  Less then a month of minimal wear, the  left side stone is now missing.",0
3,"If you're built like Audrey Hepburn, I suppose this jacket could be considered a large. If you happen to have an ample bosom, don't plan on ever zipping this jacket unless the intent is to wear a compression jacket. It seems like it could have been a worthy item for wear on for cooler fall or spring mornings but around my house it's simply too snugly fitting to be wearable.",0
5,"I paid less than $10 so I assumed I was getting a very basic slipper; nothing insanely excellent; that‚Äôs just what I got. I got the gray size 5/6 for my daughter even though she wears a size 7 in shoes; I just know from experience that all cushy slippers sink or flatten on the inside as you wear them so they get loose with time. These fit her size 7 feet perfectly and my size 7.5 feet; after a month of use, as expected, the insides feel a little big now. So order a solid size or two down. The nonslip bottoms is basic; it‚Äôs not solid rubber, it‚Äôs like slipper slicks with little dots of rubber so not great for stairs. Overall, I recommend these if you need slippers, don‚Äôt want to spend much/gifting them, and expect to get a good winter's season of use.",1
5,Order a size larger.,1
5,I love it!!!! Very pretty....,1
2,too small,0
5,I really love this bracelet I like it so much I think that I will order me another real soon,1
4, ,1
5,I'm able to see so well with these sunglasses! I purchase a second pair in the event that I might lose them. Thats how great they work.. These are multifocal at its best! They work so well that sometimes I forget to take them off in the house. I can not believe the low price? I never even had prescription eyewear that worked this well.,1
3,"Giving this three stars because a couple fixes could be a great shirt. I love love the sleeves! The design is super cute and the length is perfect. The overall feel of the material is kind of stiff and uncomfortable, could be worse though. Maybe a wash will help. I also think this runs a little big in size, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 165 lbs with a 38DD chest so I usually wear a large but I think I could‚Äôve gotten away with a medium here and it would‚Äôve fit perfectly fine. I do like it tucked in the front, if not it‚Äôs way to flowey and unflattering. I‚Äôll probably order another color in Medium to see if I like it better.",0
5,cute,1
3,I love the softness of vegan leather; Rofozzi‚Äôs styles and the quality is great for the most part. The only issue I have are the tiny pieces of leather in the outside and the metal parts are as durable as I‚Äôd like them to be. At first it didn‚Äôt seem like a big issue but I now I feel it is because those little pieces and parts can ruin the entire usage and look of the bag. I truly hope Rofozzi fixes or improves this issue because I do love the handbags.,0
3,"Love the design and cut. The cups are a little large, so I have extra room There and it gaps a little whe dry but resolves when wet. Runs a little large, so consider ordering down a size. Color is true, hasn't faded. For the price, it's a good suit. I do wish the top and bottom were sold separately so you could customize the size.",0
5,love it and so does my daughter as it was a gift!,1
5,Good,1
3,Some come without a pair (like the split heart ones). I got a lot of emoji ones... which I will probably never use. Some have other language on them. But most of the rest were good. Make decent charms.,0
3,They were broken at the bottom on both sides,0
5,Using the straps for my 10-year-old cheerleading daughter- ensure work great!,1
5,Fit as expected. Material is very soft.,1
2,"These pajamas are really adorable, however that's where my joy in them stopped. First they run small, so size up, secondly they are mostly polyester so have very little movement, and are hot... really overall disappointing in the end",0
1,"You get what you pay for.  It's very difficult to change the date and time.  When I decide to wear the watch, I have to use a needle nose pliers to make the adjustment.",0
4,"Really good looking shirt, nice material. It runs small so order at least one size up.",1
3,It work fine but look funny with huge watch and tiny band.,0
5,Love the design,1
5,The band was perfect for my Iwatch at a very good price in comparison with what they charge at the Apple store.,1
1,NO SUPPORT!,0
1,These are ruined after the first wash,0
2,"I originally ordered this dress to wear with boots a to a winter baby shower. It looks very cute in the picture, but I think you need to be stick thin in order to pull this off. Very cute, but runs very small. Unfortunately, I ended up returning it.",0
5,Love these.,1
3,runs small in the waist,0
1,Had it for less then ten min. Put it on once. Fell apart. Wtf. Not worth it. Paid for overnight to. Pass.,0
3,Nice belt but has to few holes.  I had to put a few holes in the belt myself.,0
5,"Exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. More colors, please.",1
5,Arrived on time. Items are as photographed.,1
5,"I do Pilates and these are just perfect, comfortable, warm and non skid.",1
3,Faded after a few days. Tends to peel if wearing everyday wouldn't recommend. Does look classy and matches with jeans,0
5,Best wrist band I have had for this watch. Really like it.,1
1,Tried it.  Doesn‚Äôt do a thing.  Don‚Äôt bother.,0
1,I was excited with this product until I received it. the material on the side is awful!!!,0
1,"Broke and fell apart after first use. Had high hopes, guess you get what you pay for",0
3,Nice quality however it isn't what I expected.  I couldn't tell the robe had an open front and the sizes ran small.  Order one size up.,0
2,"Nice sunglasses and fit for the $...I've been a &#34;sunglasses snob&#34; in the past and have wasted money on/ owned Raybans, Oakleys, Sun Clouds etc.  These fit & finish nicely for the money paid and I would definitely buy them again (I might, just for a spare pair!)<br /><br />***UPDATE: &#34;BUYER BEWARE!!***<br />I've had numerous Issues already within the first 7 months of owning these Sungait polarized sunglasses...The nose pads began softened up and began &#34;leaking&#34;, leaving black marks at the point where they contact my nose.  Secondly now the nose pads have began to peel off their metal bridge-mounts and the bare metal is against my nose..,Lastly, if the earpieces come into contact with the lenses (while they're folded up), it scratches the inside of the polarized lenses!?",0
2,"Never by based on the photos. I baught this dress thinking it would be knee length, but the model in the photo must be 7 feet tall or something. This dress reached almost to my ankles and in a regular 5 foot 2. After getting the hem up a little, its still not exactly the photo, but is atleast something I can wear now. Remember to always check item descriptions before buying, alright.",0
2,"Hat fit well and looked good. Problem being; it is advertised as saying ""SODAK"" on the patch. It does not. Instead of something unique, it falls flat and feels like a truck stop souvenir. Please advertise as expected.",0
1,It had a hole in the red seam and the fabric feels weird it collects all hair and fuzz may be wearable only once,0
1,Jacket is stiff and material is very low quality. Returning item.,0
5,"Fits great I like it, Soft & warm! Pockets zip up, just wish they had more colors!",1
5,I like my shirts loose fitting and this is just right.,1
3,expensive for what it is... a sun hat that won't stay on your head in the slightest bit of wind.,0
1,"Small,cheap,flimsy very disappointed don't deserve a star",0
5,So far it has kept my headaches at bay! They are super cute too. I will buy again!,1
5,"This dirndl is everything I hoped for and more. It's substantial, well constructed, and has the most beautiful details on the apron which the picture doesn't do justice. I used the sizing guide, which required a size larger than I typically wear by US sizes, but the fit was perfect. I suggest measuring yourself and referring to the guide, and you won't have trouble.<br /><br />I chose this one for it's cheerful red color, which was exactly as shown. Also, it's conservative enough for family use, as opposed to many of the dirndls available for purposes obviously less authentic than what I wanted it for. I couldn't be more pleased.",1
5,bought for my son and he loved it.  simple and clean.,1
3,"it literally looks like a ""free pattern sewing "" the sewing sucks  it look s like a cut out put together",0
2,Not the material I thought it was!,0
5,Super cute! Just as pictured!!,1

5,I love this band it fits my apple 5 watch so good and it looks so good on my wrist I highly recommend if you like nightmare before Christmas,1
5,"Band is very well made, print on tag is clear, concise and easy to read. Took a few weeks to get because it is made on demand off shore but very satisfied with the quality and price.",1
5,Fit great and look good too,1
1,"Once I got them and tried them on, they were just to large for my style. They're nice looking, fit well, and even very stylish, but just not for me.",0
5,These are so handy to have at work as a nurse.  All of our team have them.  I previously bought another brand and couldn't find replacement batteries.  These come with an extra set for each fob.  Definitely a good purchase!,1
1,Good looking watch but quit running it will be good for toy watch for kids!!,0
1,***DO NOT BUY***<br />The information on the site is inaccurate. The bottom piece fits fine but the top doesn't fit a size S/M. It is like if it was cut and assembled wrong.,0
3,"Although they look super cute and just like the picture, they're very thin and flimsy and the color of the tint is a little too dark for my taste.",0
1,"Garbage! False advertising! This is not glitter, it‚Äôs a picture of spots! There is not a single speck of glitter!! Very disappointed. Was needing it for my daughters Prom.",0
5,This dress was so flattering and comfortable. Fit true to size. Was perfect for the Great Gatsby style party.,1
1,The reason for my low rating on the braclet is beacuse the crystals/rhinestones are only in the front center and its so expensive for the braclet not to have fully circulating crystals. Inwas really disappointed. Its for my wedding and it wasnt what I expected. Shipping was slow took over 3 weeks for it to arrive. I honestly would have gave this a max rating if it would have the rhinestones all the way around not just in the middle front place. On the picture you can see the front part thats the only one with rhinestones and the sides DO NOT have rhinestones its pure meta! Thanks,0
5,"The shirt is extraordinarily comfortable in hot weather; well-ventilated and feather-light. This is the best of the many high SPF shirts I own, and also the least expensive.",1
4,Darling but to small. Need to return two of them.,1
5,"The dress is made beautifully, fits well!",1
1,Only last one day.  We went to the river and in two hours broke.<br />Not strong at all.,0
5,On time delivery and fit great except the sleeves were a little longer than what I like. My wife had no problems shortening them. Had lots of compliments on jacket.,1
3,"This is very small. It barely fits over my head. I love the overall idea and I think it is functional, but I really wish it was bigger.",0
5,Loved these earrings!  Bought them in rose gold.  They look just like real watermelon tourmaline.,1
4,I particularly like these shoes. They're not like normal mesh shoes and they have a good sole on the them.,1
5,perfect size. Thank you,1
3,"It's cute the the torso is so incredible short. And I'm 5'2, so I can't imagine how short the torso would feel on a woman of average height. But it's cute and is pretty good quality.",0
1,No matter the size you get the length doesn‚Äôt chance. Only gets wider and more awkward.,0
4,"I was very excited to find and order this product. My so is testing for black this October! I'm shine my dismay when it arrived, in a completely shredded box! I was terribly concerned the slats would be broken or damaged. Luckily they were not! I examined the product before UPS left, and I'm glad I was able to do so. The cardboard was extremely thin and poor quality. Thankful the boards were intact.",1
2,"Too small. I thought this was a bigger watch and it looked like a women's watch or a kids watch. I'm a big boy, and I needed a big boy watch. I gave this watch to my 8 year old nephew.",0
1,"THE YELLOW DRESS IS TERRIBLY MADE, IT FITS BADLY IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE IT IS ADVERTISED.<br />IAM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED. WOULD SEND IT BACK IF IT DIDN'T COME FROM CHINA, INSTEAD I AM GOING TO HAVE IT REMADE INTO ANOTHER GARMENT. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE ASHAMED.",0
1,Piece of junk!!!!!! Black came right off while my husband was cleaning the bathroom floor...... NOT cool!,0
5,"comfortable, cup is a little larger than the first ones I ordered",1
5,Like,1
2,Poor quality,0
5,Very comfortable and fit perfectly,1
5,It's a really pretty dress with swing to it the only down size to is is that I can stand to lose a few lbs.  Other than that it's great,1
3,Beautiful dress but runs very small. Very tight in chest and arms.,0
5,"great concept, takes practice but does the job when no one is around to help. I love this product and use it often.  Highly recommend.  Just don't misplace it, that part is easy and you'll be sad if you can't find it.",1
3,made for men and I knew that but tried anyway.  not for females,0
3,Visor was smaller than I expected.,0
5,These definitely help support me and keep my legs/feet healthy while on my feet for 13+ hours.,1
3,UPDATE - The Backpack might be awful but the Customer Service is Great! They tried to solve the issue and I was impressed by the response time.  We did end up going with a different backpack.  Perhaps we ended up with a lemon but we were not going to get the same one again.<br />Original:<br />It just came today and I'm Not Impressed.  Came with holes on sides.  Son leaving tomorrow and I don't have time to buy something else or I would return it. Don't buy!!,0
5,"Well made, quality leotard. Fits as expected",1
1,"When I received my package the bag was ripped open and I am missing 4 of the clips, these were supposed to be gifts for my groomsmen for my wedding but now I‚Äôm going to have to order something else",0
4,"The gloves compliment the costume perfectly. My grandson wears them everywhere.  He's 4 and although the gloves are a little large, he doesn't mind.",1
5,i love it great item,1
3,Sweater was pretty but I was looking for a thicker material. The head opening was small so when I tried it on the neck seam came apart. I normally get a large but ordered an XL because of the reviews. I could have gone a size bigger because it was to snug. I did return the sweater but that‚Äôs because it didn‚Äôt work for me. It was over a decent looking sweater.,0
5,Beautiful material! Not cheap at all! Love the colors! Fits beautifully! Definitely worth the money! ‚ò∫Ô∏è First time buying from Amazon also!,1
2,Great looking...but NO front fly...there going back,0
3,The 4yr old and 7 yr old loved them. But after a few times opening and closing the lens I noticed one lens was loose and fell off. We could snap it back in place but it kept coming off. Big disappointment.,0
4,looks like nice quality,1
5,Purchased for my Office Manager's 10 year work anniversary.  She loves it.,1
5,"I actually got these for my four-year-old daughter. Some of the review stated that the headbands fit small so I thought they would work for her. I did not find this to be the case. They are big for her, but fit me perfectly. That doesn't stop her from wearing them though.",1
4,"Packaging was a bit dinged up, but product was perfect!",1
4,"It's SUPER small. You shouldn't plan on using it to carry a cell phone or medium-large wallet because there is definitely no space for it. I was able to carry a small wallet, some lip gloss, lip stain, very small bottle of lotion,  and that's about it without being super stuffed. My cell phone, which is an S9, couldn't even fit by itself. However, it is super cute and unique. It's also very well made and good quality. When I wore it, I received lots of compliments.",1
5,Pretty and nice,1
5,Very nice but smaller than expected,1
3,"I loved this dress so much in the stock photo. Unfortunately the detail of the dress is more gold than black. I knew this from reading reviews, but it just isn't quite right. I don't like the way the detail sits between the under skirt and the tulle layer. It got all folded up during shipping and didn't lay correctly. Probably an easy fix, but irritated me. The color is lovely, and the dress is pretty, just not as amazing as I wanted it to be.",0
3,The quality of the lens leaves something to be desired.,0
5,High quality tank with accurate description online. Was a bit too snug for my liking and I contacted the seller and the exchange for a larger size was prompt and easy.,1
5,"These little bags are great for storing charging cables and cell phone batteries to keep them together and not scratched up in your bag. I wouldn't use them for glasses, as they offer no protection, but then why would I need more than one?",1
5,"Absolutely love this bag. I carry it everyday. It's sturdy, it looks great. Very good quality",1
5,This little purse has an elegant look to it. Wore one time and gave it away because my friend loved it so much.,1
1,Fitting not true to size and too then for you to charge 50.00 for it. 20.00 Hoodie at best. Poor quality.,0
2,"They are quite big and they look to have something gold in the center but even getting closer, you can't tell it's a lion.  If you want them for that purpose, there are others",0
4,Nice fit and fast delivery! üëå,1
5,"These rhinestone cross earrings are so cute!  Very light and sparkly, also a great buy.",1
3,"The color I received is a different shade than the one shown, not as vibrant as the picture. I love the design of this but it is styled a bit strange having the shoulder seems at mid-bicep, which makes it fit weird because of its A shape.",0
5,"I started potty training my 23 month old son today. So far no pee in the potty and 5 pairs of training pants in the laundry. I think I'll need to order a few more pairs before this is all said and done! I ordered two different brands. I really like how these fit. I ordered the 2T because that's the size he's wearing in clothes. They are a little snug around the legs, but he's got chunky thighs and snug is probably good as it gives a tiny bit of protection. They look like underwear, but have added protection that keeps dribbles from getting too far (as long as I'm paying close attention!) My son is still trying to get the hang of lowering and raising his undies, but I'm sure the loops in the waist band will be helpful if for no other reason than that they help him position his hands correctly (not pulling up from the crotch or anywhere else.)",1
4,"The necklace & pendant I received are different from the one shown in the pictures. Instead of a clean silver finish, it is the antique finish pendant. Nonetheless, a stunning piece. The chain is short, so I switched it with a 20' sterling silver chain. I love this item, very happy with the purchase.",1
4,Encantada,1
3,"I really liked the look of this wallet as it was very flat in the picture, but in person it had a number of design flaws.<br />The coin purse inside has no accordion sides so it really only holds a few coins. The flatness of the design is not helped by the large snaps that add extra thickness. The leather is fine quality and might be very durable, but its not particularly soft or supple. Last but not least, having to unsnap two snaps every time you want to get into the wallet is a bit of a nuisance.<br />Taking those comments into consideration, I still think it could be a good choice for somebody who doesn‚Äôt carry around many coins, a fairly typical thing these days, and someone for whom the thinness is not a huge factor.<br />The minimalist design is quite attractive.",0
5,Todo bueno,1
4,"The dress is very cute.  Nice pattern.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, wear a size 10 pants and have a large D size bust.  I bought the large. The dress came past my knees, so I had it hemmed up.  I‚Äôm in my 30s and feel it‚Äôs a too low cut for the office, but my bust is large so it‚Äôs very noticeable.  A pin or stitch to keep it in place will work.  The reason for 4 stars is because the material is a bit thin. It may show through in bright sunlight, which is something I‚Äôll need to consider when wearing.  Overall, Im happy with this dress though!",1
4,"Strong, great material, you may need to stuff it to keep the shape. Colour is OK",1
2,"Not what I expected. Material is like a rough rayon feel, but thin and cheap. I normally wear a size L or 12 pants, but these were still loose. Didn't seem stretch. Pant cuff wasn't not skinny tapered and also it's folded with a sewn on brand tag to it.",0
5,Clips is perfect fit on my suppender.,1

5,The socks are nice and soft and fit well.  The gripper soles work great and the socks are nice and fluffy.,1
5,Lots of fun on Bourbpn Street!,1
5,Works great!  My son used it as part of his gothicorn Halloween costume this year.,1
3,Nice stretchy material but it definitely runs small I ordered a 2x I normally wear a xl and its snug but to small that I can't wear it. Definatly order at least a size or two bigger than what you normally wear,0
3,"I love Swarovski.  The earrings and the necklace was very nice, and I am sure I will enjoy wearing them.  On the other hand the bracelet was quite disappointing.  Oh it matched the other jewelry perfectly, It was just way to small for an adults wrist...  Guess I will be giving it to my 5 year old niece.  It will fit her perfectly!",0
3,"Both the key chains are broken after little use. Not made to withstand being in a pocket for very long. They are really cute though, and still like to have them as keepsakes.",0
2,The rings ‚Äúlook‚Äù nice. But I ordered size 20G and received 18G.<br />18G is bigger than 20G.,0
1,Don't bother! I bought these for a party and these started going out before we even got there. They were dead by the end of the night. What a waste of money.,0
5,All good,1
5,Perfect size for littles that like to wear necklaces.,1
3,Ran very small...unable to wear them.,0
5,Received in time and fit great!,1
5,Requested for a project and they worked well.,1
3,Very short shirt not as long as in picture it cuts off at the waist like a crop top,0
5,Haven't worn it yet since my hiking season hasn't started yet but love the fabric.,1
5,"Grand daughter Harry Potter fan really liked it.  3/4 sleeves, normal neckline and relaxed fit (not form fitting) made it perfect.",1
2,"This coat runs really large. I purchased a medium and it‚Äôs so big and long, even for me and I‚Äôm pregnant (6 months 5‚Äô3 152 lbs) . I‚Äôve missed the return window and now I‚Äôm stuck with it. Anyone interested in trading?",0
5,I love it,1
1,Dela sintiera muy peque√±o,0
1,"Bought for eye protection working as RN. Arrived so scratched up they aren‚Äôt usable at work for extended wearing, poor visibility. Would not recommend",0
3,"Too bulky. Didn't expect that, probably my own fault for not paying attention, high quality though.",0
2,Ordered my normal size and it is not as fitted as the picture depicts. Comfy despite being a bit big.,0
5,"Hat is great.  It is lightweight, even though the brim is shorter than a normal hat it still shades your eyes from the sun.  Perfect summer hat.",1
5,"Expensive, but worth every penny.  Have tried less expensive copies, no comparison.  Have purchased three times, twice for me, and the latest  . . . Pairs, white gold and gold, for a friend, two daughters, and a granddaughter.  Give these a try.  You will not be sorry!",1
5,"Beautiful., Bought this for my sis or X Mas, Thank you!",1
2,The Snap on top is torn already...not durable I assume...I love under armour but my son shoe is already torn up,0
5,Really cute and fun!,1
5,"These panties are soft and comfy. I tuck and they hold everything in place, and i am blessed there..  The bright colors are great under darker leggings,  they show thru perfectly.",1
1,Advertised as waterproof but feel like felt. Very thin and I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre waterproof,0
1,These are really small. I purchased these for a 9 year old. They would be suitable for a 4-5 year old. The picture is deceiving. They were also flimsy and cheap feeling...not worth $35.,0
1,Bad quality!,0
1,this jacket is NOT the jacket you receive!!!! The jacket shown on picture is not what you get it. The jacket takes months to arrive and to receive it and it looked like S***. Do Not purchase. I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE THIS JACKET. If you do don't say I didn't warn y'all.,0
2,Looks like a nightgown Or bathing suit cover. Wouldn't wear it out. Material wrinkles.,0
5,"I love this necklace, very nice to wear dressed up or dressed casually!!! ‚ò∫",1
3,Was sent the wrong style dress. Thankfully it for and worked out in the end. It's a bit difficult to zip over the ribbon/belt.,0
5,the shirt does run a little big but very soft and nice quality fabric.,1
4,Bought this for a semi-formal evening wedding.  Comfortable and fits well.  Not too long with 2 1/2 inch heels or higher.  Drawback:  NO POCKETS.,1
5,I bought it as a gift they loved it,1
5,looks great,1
3,run very small,0
1,Easy to come off. I lost it only after 3 days,0
2,Very good size and seems good quality received with a terrible smell I haven't been able to remove,0
3,The product came in broken but it was fixed and is a cute small purse.,0
4,"Im typically a size 6-8 and the size ""regular"" fit but a wee bit odd. There was way too much room in the front and not nearly as much in the rearend. Not to the point of being unwearable but I felt like these were made with someone that had a longer torso and not much of a butt.<br /><br />The fabric while soft is not what I would call ""buttery soft"" as most of us know that is a nod to a pricey name brand in leggings. These are less cotton feel and more brushed ""nylon"" if thats possible, but they are still soft. They are thin although mine weren't particularly see through. However they are thin and not compressive so don't expect these to act like shape wear or to smooth out anything.<br /><br />For the price though they are fun and the print was a soft mosaic that I really like.",1
4,"I really, really like the Cyanstyle hoodie.  It is listed as a hoodie sweater but it is a pullover hoodie.  I like the black/grey combination, which matches with most jeans or with black leggings.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  It did not shrink or pill in the wash.  P hung it to dry as I do with most shirts so I do not know how it would hold up in the dryer.  I took one star away because I cannot wear it!  I am usually a size medium in tops so ordered this in a medium.  I cannot even pull it over my head.  I wish I had gotten a large or even an XL as I like hoodies to be on the looser side.  I only took away one star because besides the size, the hoodie is so nice!",1
1,Does not look anything like the pic.  I am returning these. What a rip-off,0
3,Loose clamp fell off but was very nice,0
1,Item was received looking like it was used and worn with lots of fuzz.  Disappointing.,0
5,Love this hoodie ! FYI THIS IS VERY GLITTERY . Absolutely gorgeous the pictures you can not see the exact color. It's comfy and fit true to size,1

1,It faded very fast and comes apart,0
2,"Very cheap looking ,not good quality!",0
1,"The saying, &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; absolutely applies here. I got the largest size available and what came in the mail looked like a g-string. Not worth wasting your time.",0
5,"This product is exactly what i was looking for. I attached to my iphone Otter Wallet and it works perfect. I use to store items that won't fit in the Otter Wallet (bills, receipts, etc). The rubber is quite grippy as well, it stays in place on dashboard while driving.",1
4,My daughter like it,1
1,"does not fully shield eyes, need filler",0
5,Fit is great. The material is comfy and stretchy. The color Navy show in picture is a bit lighter than what I got. The quality is great! So happy!,1
5,"These board shorts are well made.  They fit well, true to size.  The colors are fun and beachy!<br /><br />They have a nice, comfy cotton feel to them, elastic waist and mesh lining.  They are breathable and dry quickly.  All in all great board shorts!",1
4,I love it it‚Äôs beautiful,1
5,Good quality,1
5,I LIKE THE FACT THE SOCKS ARE ACTUALLY LONG AND SOFT AND DOES WELL IN WASHER MACHINE,1
1,They took a week longer to get to me then I what I was told.  The brown ones the lens was out and the clip that holds them on glasses was broken. The green part lens did not fill the frame.<br />they seemed very cheap not at all like the one I was replacing.,0
5,Just YES. Great for the price not over the type amazing but I wear it a every week And it hasn‚Äôt ripped,1
4,it was very good .,1
5,These are great! I make jewelry and keychains with them. Very intricate and sturdy! Will purchase again!,1
2,I love the material to the shorts but the waist is small and got a larger size and it‚Äôs still tight and I‚Äôm typically the first size I ordered‚Ä¶ but if I go larger the length will be too long. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not for me but the material is great.,0
5,my daughter loves these boots they fit well,1
3,I normally wear a size Large and I ordered a 2XL. Still a little tight but it‚Äôs do-able,0
1,Se despega los cristales,0
5,Sick! Look great!,1
5,I have tried many goggles and these are the best for ocean swims! They do not leak or fog up and very comfortable. I would like some polarized rose-colored goggles!,1
5,"Perfect for the pool or the beach! These are also super cute! I got the size that was 6-12 months for my 10 month old and they got pretty great ! They are a little hard to put on, especially if they are wet. But they work great, look great, and so far they have held up very well with multiple uses !",1
3,"Not bad, but not great. If you have a small head, it won't fit. It's too big on my wife, but fits me just fine. Will figure out a way to adjust it. I've bought worse things from Wish.",0
1,Received item damaged,0
3,Love the look and lightweight design. These white shoes were perfect for my daughters dance competitions. Unfortunately only after three wears the tie completely broke. Amazon would not return or replace damaged merchandise.,0
5,Love this top looks great and the fabric is so soft.,1
3,"Not good quality, clasp doesn't work",0
3,My granddaughter will love these...she loves to dress up & needs the bling!,0
2,Too big for me,0
1,Description not accurate. It is not one size fits most. Tag clearly states &#34;small&#34;. Very disappointed with the purchase.  A big hassle to return item. Took the loss and will not purchase from this seller again.,0
2,"Cheap quality, it ripped right away in the back.",0
4,"The socks are tight, compressed but does not have targeted compression. Other socks and calf sleeves have a more targeted design I prefer. I will use these socks for less strenuous runs and work outs.",1

4,Nice. Knot could be a bit more substantial but good buy for a bad hair day.,1
5,So comfortable. I wish you had more colors.,1
1,Horrible piece of fabric- barely covers my shoulders!,0
3,"One is ok to wear all day, the other one is too tight. I cannot wear it for more than one minute.",0

2,"The first thing my 4 year old great grandson noticed was that the eyebrows were not red.Small mistake, true, but not to a Angry Bird loving 4 year old.",0
3,This product is a good quality. I was however mislead as i thought I was purchasing a two pack of bracelets (one blue and one pink). It does only come with one.,0
1,Not good for keeping you warm. Just expensive socks,0
1,"Didn't fit well, material was like cardboard.",0
5,Bought these for my husband and I to wear on Christmas with my family. Christmas Vacation is one of our favorite Christmas movie and we all watch it each year. For the price the quality was good. Honestly they are more of a one time wear item so I am very happy with what I paid for them.,1
1,"I initially really liked this umbrella...seemed good quality, and the lights were pretty at night. There were no instructions included, but attached the solar panel to the top of the umbrella was very easy....just make sure you don't leave it in the box and almost throw it away (I almost did). The solar panel is at the very bottom of the box, wedged between two pieces of styrofoam, so it easily looks like it's just packaging trash. Anyway, the umbrella LED lights worked for a total of 3 days, and then stopped working. I tried taking the umbrella down and reattaching the solar panel, but nothing worked to make the lights come back on. I tried flipping the off & on switch several times too. Super bummed that this item was defective. Even more bummed that they make you pay for the shipping to send it back. Definitely won't buy from this company again.",0
5,So fun!  Great value. Can't wait to wear them!,1
5,"Beautiful.  Posts are a little ling, but I can live with that.",1
5,Nice watch! The look and weight of the watch feels great with moving gears inside. I'm am very pleased with this purchase!,1
3,"loved this set for my 3 year old daughter. however the color of the shorts was a bit different than the picture. the pink of the shorts is different than the pink in the top so it doesn't really match,. I still kept it and put her on her with different tops/bottoms.",0
1,Scratch super easily. Just spend the 60 bucks and get the actual Oakley replacement,0
2,Eh... It's too small. when I lift my arms up the shirt goes up and it stays up. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew but it's ok maybe I can adjust it and make a shirt for my daughter.,0
5,I get compliments all the time.,1
3,I like it but its more like a choker...I mean come on its for The Mrs. Not a 10 year old...You'll need to also purchase a necklace extender because its so small...I like it but could've been better..,0
2,"I like the material and pockets.  My only complaint is that the sizing is way off.  I would usually wear a large, and I wanted them looser, so I ordered an extra large, but it fits like a medium.",0
5,"these are nicer than picture. quality made, matte surface, not shiny. about the size of a dime. very happy with them.",1
5,fit me perfectly with my eyeglasses and good protect  the sun hit my eyes,1
3,They fit great the stretches great they do enhance your look.  I love him to death but....  be careful when you wash them I'm not for sure if I should wash them inside out or not if that would've made a difference but washing them cause the effect of what sweatershirts and sweatpants do after you washed and dry them they cause little fabric balls all over you can take a shaving razor and remove as many little fabric balls as possible but there is quite a bit I wasn't expecting that to happen with these jeans but they did I'm upset because now they kind of don't look the greatest with all the fix balls but I love them the way they fit.did cause me to avoid purchasing more pairs,0
1,"So this was closer to orange than Pink, my 13 year old loves it but just keep in mind it‚Äôs definitely orange.",0
1,Very disappointed was super excited because there was so many great things about this product.... I ordered 0-6... it is just far to big for 0-6..... The advertising was very misleading it said it would come with a headband and it did not come with a headband.....it came with a clip not I rented for children under 3..? the quality isn‚Äôt as expected..... it‚Äôs very droopy,0
4,for my elderly mom and she loves it.,1
3,Runs small which makes it tight,0
3,It is too hard to adjust and close.,0
3,"I purchased this belt for my seven and six-year old daughters who have small frames.  I was hoping this belt would fit them, but it almost wrapped around them twice.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the belt had additional belt holes for children with smaller waists so that we could actually adjust the belt. Unless they gain 10 pounds they will not be able to use this belt, which by appearance looks to be made very well.",0

1,"Plus size design doesn't mean plus size fit with this dress. The other reviews said the arms ran small, so ordered large and the upper arms fit very tight and the chest very big, (normal size regular US small to medium). According to the listed size chart, Small should have been the correct size. Arm width is a major problem width larger chested women. Most larger chested women don't usually have thin biceps. Larger arm width needs to be addressed especially when advertising a plus size design.<br /><br />It does look like the picture. The model has thin arms and is taller than average. Nice rich green color and like the material being a little heavier.<br /><br />Decided to keep it only because it was worth it to alter it.",0
1,Sorry for the bad review but it broke my boyfriends ears out and that has never happened till now. May just throw them away.,0
5,"I ordered this for my companies party, and it fit perfect. I am 5'4 138 pounds and I ordered a small. I received so many compliments, it looks, classy, elegant, but it's also sexy.",1
1,"As other reviewers have said, these are very tiny; however, I would have been fine with them anyway if they hadn't been completely tarnished.  The ones I received don't look silver at all but instead look like they have a cheap exterior that has worn down to a look of tarnished faux yellow gold...except I haven't ever worn them because they looked that way when they arrived.  Very disappointed.",0
2,Cute but the gold only lasted a week,0
3,These aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúcompression‚Äù shirts. I‚Äôd recommend getting a larger size b/c the shirts ride up your waist when working out. They are nice & comfortable.,0
5,Made a great Christmas gift. Recipient loved it.!,1
1,The waist band has frayed on almost every pair and the printed tag is an iron on that peels off after 1st washing,0
3,"Pulled the first one out, laced it up, put it on and it fit. It looked great but the string is almost too short to tie. Pull the second one out, lace it, put it on and it fits about the same. I turn my wrist and realize either the point or the lacing is way off center. I have to wear one or the other on the side of my wrist and it doesn't look great. Other than that they're ok.",0
3,I am size 8 and ordered the size by looking at the chart but it fit too small,0
3,"Nice quality, really pretty, just size way down and wear it with the right bottoms!",0
5,These boots were even better in person! I love them!!,1
2,The bottle was not good and had been scratched,0
4,Colors were much brighter than pictured.,1
4,Seems tough and easy to install. Lightweight and compact.,1
5,I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and usually between 135-145 lbs. I wear a 38C size bra. I bought the medium and it fits perfectly. This is one of the best dresses I‚Äôve ever bought!!,1
5,Muy linda gracias,1
4,"Received my earrings in a timely manner. Item I received was as described. Post appear sturdy, color has more blue thxn purple. I would order again",1
5,"I'm 5'3, 112 pounds and the size small fit perfectly!",1
5,Super cute. Didn‚Äôt arrive broken,1
5,I needed to replace my hard case that died after 5 years. This case is a lower profile. I can find it easily. I enjoy the pattern.,1
1,That it has Bell crow to put a patch,0
3,"This was a nice hat, i liked the drawstring feature. It was just too little for my 3 year olds head.",0
1,Horrible. The medal snapped where the eyelet is after only a week on my doG. Don‚Äôt waste your money,0
5,Works on various types/sizes of boots. This purchase was for our mud room area.<br />We were so impressed we just ordered a second ‚ÄúDuty Boot Puller Boot Jack‚Äù for the closet to help with our casual wear boots.,1
5,Got this as a last minute dress for my mom for her holiday party. It fit her perfectly! The train was elegant and perfect for her event! Shipping was fast!,1
3,"This was very poorly made, as far as size goes.  The shorts are for a 6 year old and the top was for a 3 year old. It would've been very. Ute if it were proportionate.  The top fits perfect, but the shorts look like a clown.  I wouldn't buy again.",0
1,Everything fell off without me dropping keys just putting them in my purse lost all charms in two weeks max,0
5,Perfect!,1
3,"I had high hopes for these leggings, but they just didn't cut it for me. I ended up returning them. They are not as stretchy as my other leggings (Fabletics for example). They seemed really stiff. The opening at the ankle was too big, so I thought it looked funny. I am 5'8"", 180 lbs. and I ordered a large. It was fine size wise, but the way the waist band fits was not flattering to my tummy. They also do not stay up during HIIT or running. They are thick, but I didn't check to see if they were squat-proof.",0
1,I gave them to my daughter who wears a medium. Returned the second pair I purhased.,0
5,Beautiful sweater. Highly recommend. Washed great on gentle cycle with gentle detergent.,1
5,I love this as a keychain.  Well made.,1
5,So cute!!!,1
5,Very small but I am happy,1
1,Bought it for Glinda‚Äôs wand in a Wizard of Oz production.  It broke the first performance.,0
3,It does not keep your hands warm as they say.  Very comfortable and the touchscreen you have to get use to how to place your fingers.,0
5,"My 7 year old grandson has only had them for a week. He loves them, I will let you know how the hold up since the reviews were all over the place.",1
5,"I have a large wrist and was worried that this bracelet wouldn't be big enough.  I was pleasantly surprised that after adjusting it to fit, there was plenty of room.  The bracelet is also heavier than I expected, which is nice, and the detailing is very pretty.  Great purchase!",1
3,Glare is reduced very minor. Not like advertised.<br />Ok for twilight. Brightens up a gloomy day.<br />Good quality frame though.,0
3,Too small,0
5,Awesome,1
1,"This dress is not flattering and is poorly constructed. The material is less than paper thin and could only be worn with an under skirt or leggings. It was posted for $14.00, but though I‚Äôm a prime member, I was charged $15.00 to ship because it‚Äôs a third party distributor which I thought was deceptive.",0
3,little see through,0
5,Washes well. Fits well. Looks good.,1
1,I JUST removed the tie from the package getting ready to go out and THIS is what I see! The pin is BROKEN!!!,0
2,Used this product as undershirts and they were to small.,0
3,Runs small.<br />It is good quality,0
4,"[[VIDEOID:6a1e1659e9551b953e51fb7596ac789d]] The shorts fit well. However, the description indicated they have pockets and the ones I received DID NOT HAVE POCKETS!",1
5,Such great quality material from Becca!  I am a 36DD and had to go with the D size.  It runs big!,1
3,It's a pretty nice hat but it did not came in the color I want it too. I thought the hat color was going to be dark nany blue with a dark red like it looks in the picture but instead it came in light blue and light red not what I wanted,0
3,üëç,0
5,"Exceeded expectations , very detailed art work !!!! Would not hesitate to purchase again from this company knowing that I'm buying a quality product !!",1
5,Buena inversion,1
1,"waste of money, falls off in less that 10 seconds",0
5,"So far haven't had much opportunity to use it but like it.  Ordered the XL and was worried it would be too big, I generally wear a 7-1/2 to 7-3/4, but fits just right.  Like the short brim, seems most of the boonie hats out there come with 3 in or larger brims.  Like it so much I may just order some of the other color's it comes available in.",1
1,Broke in 5 days,0
4,"Great looking, comfortable shoe. Unfortunately, had to return it because it runs large. I have a wide foot and this  shoe was too wide. I suggest order a size down.",1
1,It broke as i was putting it on üò¢,0
3,"I loved this necklace but after wearing twice, the chain started turning color. Now it's a almost black chain w/ pretty white teardrops...not cute at all! I'm thinking of switching out the chain myself. I know you get what you pay for but I've gotten other necklaces before and they didn't turned as quickly as this one did. It's a shame because it's really cute.",0
4,This is so soft and so cute! Good quality!,1
3,"This is huge Macy cube size xl<br />When I ordered a medium<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 125-128 I am curvy<br />It needs to be tapered down by several inches width wise<br />I‚Äôm an express 3/4.  I have kind of a gut from having kids that I call saggy balls..,,, even then the dress is four inches too wide without a stretch. I wear a medium even in target brands for tops  And run between banana republics 3/4-5/6.  And even wear a medium in Nike leggings and nearly can‚Äôt fit a small in Nike leggings (I suffocate) still this was gigantic to the point even zipped will fall/drop straight off",0
5,I love it because it's good looking and very light-weight,1
1,Nope back out,0
2,One side continuously falls off.,0
5,"Super Duper cute and modest. Ok it is hard to get a bra that doesn't show underneath it and you CANNOT go without one, it's a little see through. But with a skin-tone strapless bra it is stunningly gorgeous! I wish it was lined, then it would be perfect.",1
5,Awesome fit. the fabric is stretchable and comfy to wear.,1
1,"The material is see through for the pink. It is super tight at the top, and the straps are more at the collar bone than hanging on your shoulders. It balloons out and is way too short. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it barely covered my belly button.<br />It says you can return, which is technically true but extremely misleading. They have to approve your return, you pay for postage, and they deduct 30%.<br />I will not be using this company ever again. Not a quality shirt, not as described, horrible return process.",0
5,It‚Äôs perfect. Thick and fine quality.,1
3,At least they were cheap.  They're not really rings to be worn. Seem more like a craft item. Uncomfortable.,0
2,Quality is subpar and fit is not good,0
5,"My niece is 2 years old and she loves it. I bought it big, 3t, and it is comfortable for her with room to grow.",1
3,"These were sooo cut.  However, it was made flimsy.",0
1,"Don‚Äôt buy this. It‚Äôs sooo cheap, the fabric is nearly translucent and it took over a month to get to me. In summary: The quality is worse than the cheapest piece of clothing at forever21.",0
5,Love this wallet .  Holds all my cards . Love the RFID protection . This wallet is slim so it's able to fit in any handbag. A winner,1
5,"It is definitely heavier, thicker, and bulkier than I thought it was going to be. Then again I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect, I thought I was going to get something over priced and that was made with cheap materials. That was not the case, this seems to be made of durable high quality materials. I haven‚Äôt had an issue with it randomly coming open at all and it actually holds a beer also.  Hopefully this review helps someone deciding if they want this or not.",1
4,"Dress is very cute but I am disappointed with the packaging, the bottom came out frayed",1
5,giftable,1
1,Asian sizes are not American sizes,0
5,"I've been wearing extra pounds over the past year and have felt more comfortable in XL.  I did order the XL and I'm glad I did.  Already being a ""slouchy-relaxed"" sweater, I appreciate having my ""extra"" covered without any bulges or anything feeling snug.<br /><br />VERY soft against my skin.<br />The front is slightly shorter than the bottom hem with a short-split on the sides.<br />The sweater has a drop-shoulder styling (also comfortable)<br />The sleeves are ample creating a somewhat ""poofy"" look on the forearm-section.<br />The cuffs keep the sleeves in place.<br />As there is not a tag on the back-neck section...the front has the ""center"" vertical stitching line.<br />(But, if you want the front longer than the back...turn it around!)<br /><br />Easy to wear a slim-fitted ""undershirt"" with any sleeve (or not) if you prefer not having the soft yarn directly against your skin or want an extra layer.",1
3,These took a little longer to ship than I anticipated but the bracelet is very cute however the links that hook it on you wrist breaks easily.,0
3,"It's made for girls without hips!  It is very straight line from top to bottom, so if you have curves on the hips, it will fit tight there.  Otherwise, it is ok. Not top quality, but not the worst I've seen.  I will wear it with a compression slip and see how it goes.",0
5,Beautiful. I love it.,1
1,It broke the second time I wore it!  Beautiful watch band but one elastic band broke and the beads flew everywhere üòû so disappointing,0
3,These are big for what i wanted. I needed them for my helix. The smallest ones work but I think they must be for eyebrows or lips.,0
2,"Pretty color, pretty dress, but the picture is deceiving. Looks like it flows loosely from bust, but it was tight through the middle.  The large might fit, bot not sure.",0
1,It‚Äôs not anything close to what description and photos showed. It is not adjustable and it‚Äôs really thin and cheaply made. It‚Äôs also not very foldable.,0
5,Does the trick!,1
3,"Rough edges. Lettering doesn‚Äôt stand out, have to close to see it.",0
5,I love the color,1
1,I ordered a x large and got medium.......my husband surely can wear these but I'm hoping my son can....,0
5,Beautifiul lava beads,1
5,"These are the most comfortable things I've had on.  They are warm but that's the reason I got them.  I wear a size 10.5 in every shoe that I buy and wear a 9 1/2 in these. So yes, they run big and figuring out the correct size might take a return or 2 but that time is well worth it.  Love wearing these around the house. Lastly, wearing a thin sock with these actually helps prevent them from becoming too warm for me. Will look to get other shoes from Orthofeet now.",1
2,"This is not a solid color like the beautiful color they show here..and it doesn't feel like a sweater. But I paid for it so I will make the best of it. Oh there is no tag no brand ,no instructions on how to care for it. Reminds me of something you get from the dollar store. Length is nice though and the style is the same as shown. Disappointed with two things I have ordered now..:/",0
5,They came just as beautiful as in the picture! They fit well and color didn‚Äôt fade when washed. Worth it!,1
5,Fantastic Socks for the Price! Very helpful with recovery after training.,1
5,Works great. Fully adjustable and stays put. Great access for that next brew.,1
4,Colour not as vivid as I expected for a cobalt blue.,1
5,"cute.  There are seams on inside leg, which is fine but I prefer seamless, this seems like a minor thing.  Seems constructed well.  Really hugs the hips.",1
5,"I got this bag for my husband. He uses it to workout, work and everyday use. Durable and holds a lot of personal stuff. He was always losing his personal items and this bag solved the problem. It‚Äôs not to big BUT not to small ! Perfect",1
5,It fits  nicely and it's warmer Than others,1
5,Amazing quality!  I absolutely love this set!,1
3,Its exactly what is says it is,0
2,"A little small on the feet, but the tightening above the knee sucks. It is constantly falling and there is no support in the shoe. Your feet will be sore after five minutes in these bad boys.",0
5,Amazing price and great quality!,1
2,"This hat is cute, and you can flip the bottom (striped) part down to fit baby as she grows, but the gray radiation-blocking fabric doesn't seem to offer much coverage of the head. This is disappointing, because I bought this hat for coverage, not looks!",0
3,"Cheap, in consistently sized .Well you get what you pay. Cheap is Cheap Donated this one.",0
5,Bought this as a gift to replace my partner's worn out key case.  Quality is very good.  My partner commented that the hooks on this are better than those on his old case.,1
5,Lovely set!!,1
1,Way way way too small. I ordered a XXL cuz its lounge wear ( im a large) for an upcoming trip. I could barely get it over my head....thank goodness I bought a back up in a store...,0
5,This jacket fit perfect for the occasion,1
1,Dont waste your money. Go and buy some yellow  lens glasses and it will serve the same purpose,0
5,"Absolutely love these.  I love their appearance.  Funky in style, Lens have great sun block",1
2,Were ok while they lasted. Broke soon after receiving them.,0
3,Was expecting it to be nicer - band is very loose,0
5,Thanks Love the Socks,1
5,"I have a dark cabnit in the foyer of my condo in Florida, that needed brightening up, I saw this great scarf with palm trees on it ordered it and it works perfectly<br />Juanita",1
3,I give it an A for style and swag but hat is big and it looks like very odd on my head. It doesn't appear to be designed for women which is ironic with the mom life logo.,0
3,Scratchy amd too tight even though the other two bras I purchased that were similar were  smalls and the sizing chart for this one said I should get a small. I will unfortunately have to donate this since t is so uncomfortable and I am outside the return window. This inside of this particular brand has a mesh and seams that rub. I checked my other one and it has 1 panel of a much softer mesh.,0
5,"It is perfect, my grandson loves it",1
3,True to size. Heel too skinny and unstable for wearing around horses  before and after riding.,0
5,It was exactly as pictured. My son loved it,1
3,"I am a size 4, 5'3"" tall. The small was SUPER loose all over and was super short (think maybe as long as mid-thigh). The material is a little weird too. The pattern is cute as is the style. I just wish it didn't run so large. I will be returning.",0
5,This is my go to favorite apple watch band.,1
1,"I just received my set of 3 tank shirts  , and come to open them and the black tank had white deodorant marks all over it , how disgusting !!! Will be sending back ASAP",0
1,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loved it, however, it's ripping away from the zipper at the top, and the bottom is tearing as well. It's quite disappointing.",0
1,The wire on the sides sticks into you and the beige one rolls I absolutely dislike these bras don't buy!!!,0
1,Product is copy. Not like photo. As it‚Äôs not genuine luminox strap,0
1,"don‚Äôt buy, cheap quality!",0
4,Great for summer evenings.  Just enough for a breeze.,1
2,"The picture makes it look cooler than it is, but it's a good accessory I suppose.",0
5,The best hair color ever! Long lasting and absolutely no mess.,1
2,It fits but I don't like the roll that it leaves above the top line of the slimmer. You can clearly see I am wearing something form fitting and it leaves this roll even though I don't have a lot of fat.... It's not attractive to me so I don't wear it.<br /><br />Other than that though it fits and is comfortable and made well. I just simply do not like the roll it leaves on the top.,0
5,"Loved this shirt!  It's so simple and comfortable!<br /><br />It's a bit shorter than expected but it's fine.  The sizing was weird which I expected after reading the reviews, I'm normally an XL and the large was just fine.",1
1,Im 5'2 and they didnt even reach my knees. The toes area was wider than any other part of the sock and were just cheaply made and not thick like i was hoping.,0
5,"LOVE THE PRODUCT, BUT IT BROKE THE SECOND. :(",1
5,"This is a present for my Grandson.  The quality is very nice.  He had one just like it before and lost it.  He really loved it, and asked for another one for Christmas.",1
4,Bigger than I expected but I like it that way.,1
4,"While these earrings are beautiful, they are so big! I can't wear this around on a regular day without people wondering what the occasion is. It's definitely beautiful though and well worth the price! Just make sure you understand how big it is. See the measurements they have given? Just take out a ruler and see how big that actually is. Will help you make better decision about any earring.... In the case, you think the size is good for you, go for these earrings. You can't really go wrong for this price!",1
5,These were perfect for a baby shower where we asked guests to draw on a onesie,1
5,"Had to have it altered in the sides, but otherwise a very nice dress for the price.  I will be very comfortable for my daughter's wedding.  The shipping was extremely fast as well.",1
1,"I usually wear a size 8-10, so I felt pretty safe ordering a large. When I opened the package, my 8 year old niece happened to be close by thought these shorts were for her. That pretty much tells you everything you need to know.",0
5,Went on the new fit-bit just great worn the same kind of band on other watches for over ten years and I am hard on them and they last for a long time so a good thing about this is if the band goes you can replace it easy with just a band without the fit-bit clips on each end .,1
2,"Love the colors, fast shipping but the balls are so small it keeps pushing all the way threw my lip. Its like theres no ball on the end but there is, its the same size as the barbell itself so nothing to keep it from falling out in your mouth.",0
5,Good product stylish,1
2,"Los lentes giran, y las patas vinieron despegadas y tambi√©n giran.",0
1,"They don't really compress and they unravel. The first time I wore one the thread on the hem kept unraveling until there was no hem. And when I washed them, they unrevealed even more.",0
5,Beautiful fit,1
5,Love it! Comfy and stylish,1
5,Very nice quality! :),1
5,"Great dress. I'm 5'5&#34;, about 190 lbs. I ordered a 16. The length is just about too short so I'm going to have to find a low heel that doesn't look geriatric. As some other reviewers mentioned, there is a static factor but it's manageable. I will be taking it to see if my tailor can let the bust out a tiny bit. I feel a little smashed (36DD) in the chest. Otherwise I really love this dress.",1
4,very cute,1
2,My son like it but it would have been way better if it came with pockets.,0
2,I ordered the largest size and still didn‚Äôt fit. It‚Äôs def not true to size. My mother who is a 10/12 still got them and it was still a close but ok.,0
1,This shawl was paper thin and had loose strings where there shouldn't be,0
4,Muy bueno el reloj,1
2,There are additional items needed to apply this nose.  I threw it away.,0
3,These are a weird fit. Read reviews bought larger size and the hips are HUGE- while the  and legs are small. I have an average height and body shape (5.5 and 140 lbs.). DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,0
2,just poor everything. Poor material. Poor stitching. Poor sizing. Wouldn't recommend,0
5,I don't have to carry a card o f 6-8 batteries in my pocket.<br />It is small enough for a man to tolerate on his car key ring.,1
2,I had to send this back. It is a fairly nice but way too small.  The Large is actually about a size small.,0
5,Christmas gift for son. Exactly what he wanted!,1
1,"Ordered this dress for an event this weekend, opened the package this week and the strap was broken! Now I have to scramble and find a new dress for my event last minute. Not happy at all.",0
1,Super small. Great for maybe a kid but not for adult.,0
5,Good quality and detail. Would have liked it better in 44 mm.,1
1,Giving it a bad review only because I received just one earring,0
5,This sweater shirt fits like a glove and is so soft!! i‚Äôm always wearing it!,1
1,"It was a pretty bracelet, but not what I wanted. Hard to get on and off. When you squeeze it together to fit your wrist it doesn‚Äôt keep its nice shape",0
5,"This dress is really nice. While it's labelled casual, it could even be considered business casual in some settings, especially when it's not ""dress down"" but a little more relaxed. The patterning looks great and the material seems durable.<br /><br />My wife is 5' 3"" and petite. It fits her nicely and she absolutely loves the comfort level.",1
3,It‚Äôs true to size,0
5,My daughter loves her dress,1
4,Great for wearing at work,1
5,it is very beautiful and well made. i have worn it several times and people are always asking where i got it.,1
3,A little to small .,0
5,Perfect size for my charm bracelet.,1
3,It fit smaller then i was expecting and the material was rougher then i thought it would be,0
2,Horrible Fit,0
5,Fits perfectly! I've always wanted this shirt (like any Tumblr girl at heart) it's tight fitting which I prefer and not uncomfortable whatsoever. Makes me really want to buy more from this seller.,1
2,Much smaller than it appears and quality is less than I'd prefer. Definitely returning it.,0
5,"I love this bathing suit! I read the reviews about it running small, so I ordered the 3X (I usually wear a large). But being a Mom of 3 and having a ‚Äúmom-bod,‚Äù I love that the tank portion is longer and doesn‚Äôt show my belly. I also love the coverage of the bottoms. Two thumbs up on both pieces! Both pieces fit me great (I‚Äôm currently 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 198lbs) and it‚Äôs not cheaply made. Great value!!",1
5,Love the color in these fun earrings,1
5,Good,1
4,Very comfortable and warm,1
1,Love the material. Sweater doesn't fit. Very very big on top and too small at waist.  Weird fit.,0
5,"Great  shape,",1
4,Like: trapped beaver<br />Dislike: beaver couldn‚Äôt breath and got stinky<br /><br />Poor poor beaver. Took numerous showers to clean.,1
5,"Fast delivery, good quality....love it!!!!!",1
3,"I quite liked it. It just felt a little cheap in material, but for the price i quite liked it.",0
5,Just perfect!  It is small but not so small that my wallet along with a few other things and cell phone won't fit.  I use the short strap which is just right for placing it over my shoulder and it stays in place.  It is light weight and a nice neutral color.  Very pleased.,1
2,Not worth it,0
5,This hat is perfect.  Brim is wide enough to keep the sun off of my face but not to big that it appears dramatic.,1
2,"Even when I order way up, I'm still disappointed. Somehow it's loose everywhere but at the bottom? And very see through. The detail around the sleeves looks poorly made and more for a tween than a grown woman trying to search for more work tops. Then again, I paid $5.",0
1,"If I could give this 0 stars I would! First off this dress said it would ship in 1-2 days, then I was informed it would ship in 4 weeks. I finally received this item and OMG what a disaster. I ordered the large, the top wasn‚Äôt probably an XS and squeezed my chest so tight my boyfriend had to help pull it over my head, I COULD not get it off! Literally never tried on something that made so horribly. Don‚Äôt bother, save your money",0
2,"Quality was fine, but these are definitely not 20g",0
3,"came within a week which is a plus! however, ordered a L - tall, im 5‚Äô9 and 180lbs. too short, length hit above ankle. i do find the top to be flattering, VERY flowey around whole bodice. comes with two belts, a black leather flower thing and a chiffon belt that matches shell. debating between altering it myself or returning.",0
4,I wore this bartending for NYE 2020. It was more comfortable then I expected. There was enough stretch in the fabric to make it move easily but be tight enough to show off my curves. All night I got compliments about how nice it looked while also being classy. Only downside was that some of the fringe at the bottom came off-- not enough for anyone else to notice but it was annoying.,1
2,This dress is drab in colour.  I purchased the purple.  It is dowdy.,0
1,This thing is not wide enough to wrap a Burrito! This is just a cheap cheap version of snatch me up.<br />DO NOT BUY!!!!,0
1,Don‚Äôt buy they look like kid glasses and fit like kid glasses,0
3,This is light weight but looks nice. I have serval shawls but this one will not stay on my shoulders when I move around. The material is not heavy enough.,0
5,"I LOVE this bracelet. It was exactly as described. It fits perfectly (I have big wrists and I can wrap it 5 times). It looks great, very stylish.",1
5,Cute and comfy! Well received!,1
5,Comfy,1
4,Nice.,1
5,"Fits true to size, very comfortable. I like my shirts a little longer in the front so I wore a tank top under it. It is truly a wrap shirt, it has a whole where the two pieces meet and it almost feels like a kangaroo pocket but you would lose anything you put in there. Overall, I wish their were more patterns so I could get more!",1
3,when you buy these - do not expect them to all work at all - I needed 48 of them for kids - and ordered 80 of them and good thing I did b/c out of the 80 of them - 60 worked...just needed tthem - but just hope the others at least last an hour b/c I only have 12 left that work to replace! they are easy prize - but you pay for what you get!,0
1,This product has an elastic waistband that cuts off the circulation to the lower half of my body. It‚Äôs not cute at all. If you‚Äôre normally a size medium order large or xl,0
3,"This dress was cute, however it hit me in kind of a weird spot for my liking. The hem was a little far below my knee, so it wasn‚Äôt as cute as it could have been. Didn't end up keeping. Very stretchy and comfortable still",0
5,Arrived exactly the same as shown in picture.,1
1,"Terrible fabric, screen print blurry. Returned right away.",0
5,Fits great and my daughter loves it!,1
3,Looks nice but way too tight; bought 2 XL,0
5,"Perfect couldn't ask for more, exactly as advertised.",1
5,I bought one from Marshall's and worked out with it and loved it . Looked at their website but they didn't have it was so excited that Amazon have it .,1
5,good pants for the price,1
5,love it,1
3,"A strange critique but the material is too thick. You want to be able to fold and twist a scarf this long and with the material being thicker it does not make it comfortable to wear, too much material around your neck.  The color was exactly as pictured, very pretty.",0
2,Very poor made.,0
5,Comfey. A little longer than I expected but that's fine.,1
5,"Girlfriend loved it!!! Really soft lace not rough at all. She is 5'3 and got her the medium, fits just right.",1
5,nice,1
3,Good quality but much smaller than the stones represented in the picture. Not quite the size the description said they would be.,0
3,Gaudy,0
5,"Super cute, comfortable, lightweight and well made. I purchased to wear to the pool on vacation over my swimsuit but ended up using it over a tank top with jeans to our for dinner. It looked very elegant and was easy to dress up! I loved the fact that, even on a humid summer night, I feel comfortable with this on and in a cool AC restaurant I didn't feel cold or uncomfortable. I'll continue to use it as a dress up piece!",1
1,"I purchased this item after a major foot surgery so I would be easy to wear. It is a horrible material, it is stuck together and pilled up. No matter how I wash it or how much fabric softener is used, it is the same. I paid a lot for it and expected better. I would have sent this earlier but was not able. Will not recommend anyone to purchase this item. I do not usually send bad reviews but I could not let it go without.",0
3,"While for the most part the colors are bright and vibrant, disappointed Goku's pants are VERY faded, almost invisible! But I like the material overall a good hoodie.",0
4,I bought these for my 3 year old daughter. I bought two sizes up because I know that‚Äôs standard for ballet shoes. The last pair I bought were Capezio and I would say these are comparable. The leather is nice quality and the color is a classic ballet pink. The only thing I wish they had added is a name tag inside like some of the bigger brands have.,1
2,Nothing special.,0
3,It‚Äôs very cute. If you wore high waisted jeans might work.,0
3,"I absolutely love the necklace, it's perfect and exactly what I wanted. However, after only wearing it three times it's beginning to turn. I'm so very disappointed in the quality that I can't even get a whole summer's worth of wear out of it. I expected more.",0
5,"Love the colors on this dress and it glides down your body and is very forgiving for those of us getting a little ""fluffy"" as I call it.  The material has a nice weight to it and is not see thru.  I had to wait for this dress and could not be happier.  Now if I can just get on that cruise ship and show it off!  You will love it too!",1
5,"Great feel to fabric quality. My husband is a bodybuilder and the 3x fits comfortably in arms, across chest, and waist with a good length that doesn't shrink. Definitely recommend.",1
5,I am extremely pleased by its overall quality,1
1,"Really small<br /> I ordered 4 sizes up and they fit me- but not like a jogger style should, they were tight like skinny jeans. Not good",0
2,Was disappointed with this,0
1,Pictures make it look like stainless steel- it is cheap black plastic and the majority of the compasses (I bought a dozen) are off by 30 degrees. Unfortunately I bought these for a presentation and do not have time to reorder! Buyers beware!,0
3,"Lo que no me agrado es que la talla no se adapta a la realidad porque Large se entiende Large y parece Small, corregir esto.",0
3,Runs really small.  Had to give them away,0
1,"Please don't buy this shirt. In fact, the only reason it's getting one star is because i couldn't select half a star. Got it in large and xxl and there was no difference in size at all. Literally held the two shirts together and they were the SAME SIZE. Not sure what sizes they are basing the size chart on but it's definitely not US sizes. I've never had an issue with anything fitting that I buy from Amazon but this product definitely note has me leary about ordering online",0
5,Great dress thicker material than I thought! It‚Äôs not quite my style with the large flowers but I‚Äôll be honest I like it a lot! Great for a summer picnic or outdoor event!,1
1,Not adjustable to fit!,0
1,The worst smell imaginable. I have tried everything to remove the odor and it still smells.,0
3,Muy grande,0
2,"La zuela es demasiado blanda, y la talla de la orma queda m√°s grande que la talla normal,<br />.",0
1,Too big,0
2,will a single drop from three feet (on a backpack while riding my bike) it fell apart and all parts went in five directions.  will not buy again.,0
3,Fits well. Not very thick. The decal is cheaper quality than I expected. More like an iron on.,0
4,"A pretty good strapless bra. Sizes was about tricky, but the company was great about returns/exchanges.",1
5,really nice light weight earrings,1
3,"Pretty shirt, but the material is much thinner than it appears online.",0
4,"Just a bit too large, but wearable. I like it",1
1,I didn't like the stretch over the bust. It didn't fit right and became white-ish like from the spandex. It was also short for a the largest size they have. I will be returning.,0
2,It's a very cheaply made shirt. NOTHING special at all. Very basic and NOT flattering at all. Returning for full refund.,0
1,"These have grippers to hold the floor and are fuzzy and warm. But they don't stay on in bed, and the black ones shed all over the carpet. I sure would not buy again or recommend.",0
3,"The fabric is very flimsy.  If it had more body to it, I would rate it higher.  I like the size, as so many bags are very small.",0
1,This is PU ‚Äúleather‚Äù.  I immediately sent it back.,0
5,This dress is so comfortable. The material is just right. Not to thin and not too thick.  I ordered another one after receiving my first order.,1
1,Poor unbreathable material. Don‚Äôt get this junk for your kid.,0
5,"I've never been a hat person.  I don't think that hats look good on me as my head is (to me) oddly shaped and not made for hats.  I was pleasantly surprised with this hat though and am glad that I got it.  I mainly bought it to wear to SCA events but have worn it other places since I got it.  It makes a great hat for hiking in the desert!<br /><br />The brim isn't overly huge, but it's big enough to protect your head and shoulders from the sun.  The hat has a chin strap which is a good thing, otherwise I would have lost my hat off the top of the Mesa on my hiking trip in New Mexico recently!  The wind on top of the Mesa was pretty gusty, enough to push you if you weren't bracing yourself! The hat itself is flexible and soft but not too much.  You can easily roll it up and pack it in your suitcase and unroll it when you get to your destination and it not loose its shape.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really impressed with this hat and am glad that I purchased it!",1
4,Smaller than expected but great for traveling and seems sturdy.,1
1,Pretty disappointing. Lens pop out very easily. Pretty much a junk buy on my park. Could've got these at a table on the strip for half the price.,0
5,I am 65 and i have lots of admirers when i wear these,1
3,Just ok nike dri fit tops super thin and run big size down forsure.,0
4,Cute!,1
1,"The medium and small are huge!!! Why!?!?! I'm 5'3"" and a curvy 126lbs, this skirt made me look frumpy and heavy. Cute print, scratchy and stiff fabric.",0
5,"My husband uses these as work shoes, and they do the job for him. But if you work and get dirty, you‚Äôll have to order another pair again in 6 month‚Äôs.",1
5,"perfect,  fast delivery",1
3,Ordered a medium and it ran like an xl. Very boxy and wasn‚Äôt flattering at all.,0
2,"I know this is not a high quality piece, but I am very disappointed that when I received the necklace the majority of the dangle pieces at the end at already fallen off. I have only worn it twice (second time for only 3 hours now) and there are only 2 dangle pieces left on the necklace. This was a waste of money. Very disappointed because it is a pretty piece for the price.",0
2,Returned these. They were huge and looked cheap on.,0
1,Quality is terrible. Buttons do not match with buttonholes. Appears to have been made with no care.,0
5,"Nice quality. Love it.  Its a smaller hat.  If you have a big head or ever got teased for having a big head growing up, stay away!",1
5,Oh absolutely adorable. My little one wore these everyday on a trip to the mountains,1
3,"Fits as expected, but fabric is lighter weight than I expected.  I wanted a heavier, warmer sweatshirt.  I won't be ordering any more of this brand. :(",0
5,Going to my company's Christmas party,1
1,I usually wear a large. I got the extra large-very tight. Not loose for exercise.,0
3,"This shirt does not even button up and it is supposed to be a 'classic fit' XXL. My friend wears a L/XL depending on brands, and this one fits him almost perfectly. He said it fits just like the other XL slim fit shirts that he has. There is no way they are sizing these accurately for an XXL classic fit.",0
4,Very useful and functional,1
1,"This product was not what I thought it was going to be. It doesn‚Äôt fit, not even close and the material is cheap.",0
2,"the bag is smaller than it looked. when you say faux leather, it really is faux leather and it looks  like it",0
5,These Sandals are great!!!<br />I love this style shoe for my son he is 3 &<br />We ordered the size 9 they fit perfect. They are easy to put on & take off & comfy!<br />Those are important features for us!<br />Also super cute & great style!<br />Thank you London Fog<br />Will definitely buy again:),1
1,"The zipper was broken. It wouldn't unzip. The lace was tattered. I wouldn't recommend this item at all. In fact, the picture is so not like the dress.",0
5,"Quality, funny.",1
5,Really cute on my new favorite top!,1
5,Love the material.  So comfortable<br />Perfect for summer and im covered where i want to be!,1
3,Kinda heavy but cute,0
3,"Great quality pj bottoms, but run large and very long.",0
5,This top is so cute!  I have ordered the blue and the white!,1
3,"Cheaply made, I‚Äôll fitting beanie with a patch. Not worth the price at all.",0
5,So far so good. Not too big and not too small. I would say medium. Could fit a large notebook. Not clunky diaper bag size. More like old school coach size.,1
1,"Got a baby size and adult size, both were about the same in size. The ojo is bigger than it looks in the pic. The bracelets from the remate(swapmeet) are better.",0
5,These shoes don't fit at ALL!!! BUT I did get a totally cute purse out of the deal so I'm happy.  It's a little than I thought but not by a lot- just enough for me to fit everything I need in it.  Great buy.  10/10 would recommend.,1
4,Looks nice not bad you kinda know you got what you pay for,1
3,"These are long and heavy. The string knot is rather visible between each pearl. They looked OK, but really not what I thought they would be like. Returned them to look for something else.",0
4,"I have many Uggs boots, but these disappoint -- the quilting plus the crystal buckles were just a bit too much for me... It's just not 'me'.",1
3,They starting tarnish just got them Tuesday. But still cute I guess,0
5,Great swimsuit for the price,1
1,The color peels off after one wear.,0
5,Thicker fabric than I expected but overall great look on me!,1
5,"This product was perfect for me. I actually use it as a case for my USB chargers, and it can perfectly fit both cords and the adapter.",1
2,"Feel nice, but too small. I ordered 40D and they fit my daughter who is 38C. After only a couple of months the cups are indented and not holding their shape. There is also at least 1 that has an underwrite poking through already. I'd return them, but it's too late. :(",0
5,Beautiful colors,1
2,"In my opinion, it is to small. I thought it would fit like the one I had during my time in the Marines. I also dislike he feel. It is to thin. This mask doesn't work well aro7nd heavy dust and doesn't protect from the sun like I would like it to do so",0
2,"Very large for its card capacity. Cheap build quality. The rubber border that seals the edges started peeling away after a couple months of carrying it every day. Bought it with the mindset of &#34;Why do I need an expensive wallet&#34;, answer, you don't but this one falls below the bar. Spend an extra $5-10 and get something better.<br /><br />The seller is now trying to bribe me to remove this review.",0
1,Good gosh this thing is tiny!!! Not even close to an XL. It fits like a small.,0
4,Very loose because it has little dainty strings that hold it closed. So I recommend something to hold up the girls like a bralette or something. Really cute and sexy though!,1
2,The hat and shirt are wonderful but the shorts are sewn incorrectly. The one-sided inside lining is sewn to the front on one leg and the back on the other. This means you can only put one leg in.,0
1,Does not fit to size.,0
4,Very cute but somewhat large,1
2,Too small in all the wrong places and poor quality fabric. I may have compromised if it fit as expected. Disappointed.,0
2,"I do like this coat, it is warm and soft...but I am disappointed my coat wasn't lined when I received it. My friend recently ordered the same coat and it was lined. I see all the images for this coat have lining and I am annoyed about mine.",0
5,Love this bag it is a good size.,1
1,Not a true size. Run small,0
4,"This suit is well made and has a flattering design. The  material is high quality and all the seams are serged and well secured. As far as quality goes, there is nothing to complain about. However, the description states that this suit has an underwire, and it does NOT have an underwire. It has soft cups.<br />The fit is not going to work for everyone. When I purchased this suit, there was a size guide that is now gone. I bought the size based on the measurements provided, but it was much too large. The size guide also specified a bra cup size to go with each size that is also now gone from the listing. The cup sizes seem to be pretty generous for the size of the suit. I think this suit would be best for ladies who are busty for their size, and when in doubt, go with a smaller size over a larger.<br />I received a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1
2,"I thought this sweater would be of decent quality but was wrong. The material is thin. I bought a large, I am 5'11 180 lbs and it barely fit. I'm more disappointed with the quality than the fit but fear the sweater is going to shrink after washing and won't fit at all. Don't waste your money.",0
5,Very cute dress!!! Love the colors. Wish it had pockets.,1
5,The neckties are everything and more the seller mentioned. Good purchase,1
3,"This is a very beautiful top, however it is cheaply made and runs very big. A small would have been better. I will have to sew some of it myself. (Glad I can sew) however the Colors are bright and vibrant. Overall I'm pretty satisfied.",0
1,"This waist trainer doesn‚Äôt stay in place, once you put it on and start to do normal movements it starts to slip, and if you sit it just rolls and bunches up. It‚Äôs actual comical üòÇ.  I am not a fat person just have a big tummy, and this can‚Äôt even hold my belly in, I laugh, that‚Äôs all I got for this purchase. Don‚Äôt waste you money. See my pictures üòÇ",0
5,Perfect! Exactly what I wanted for my costume,1
1,These were not worth the money I ended up not using them the little balls on top did not stay just to much to put together we did staple them but not worth it,0
4,"Love this watch. It looks great and keeps time perfectly. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the second hand on the chronograph doesn't always line up perfectly with the numbers. Not that big of a deal for me, but it is worth noting. The strap is good quality soft leather. When I ordered it, I had planned on replacing the strap, but it looks better in person imo. I may wind up sticking with it now. Overall, a very solid watch for an affordable price.",1
3,Ran small. Nice summer fabric as the fabric is thin but not see through. Looks as pictured.,0
5,I love this duster.,1
5,Great item for price,1
2,"I loved these pants when I first put them on. So comfortable, wonderful fit and the material felt smooth and soft. Unfortunately after three washing they look like the picture, the piling is really ugly.  I can‚Äôt afford pants that don‚Äôt last any better than this.8",0
1,Awful and way bigger than picture.,0
3,The quality isn't what I was hoping to receive but then again for the price I wasn't expecting much. Its cute especially for the price.,0
4,"Item was OK. I didn‚Äôt particularly like the material, so I sent it back.",1
5,This shirt is really cute. It fits and looks just like the picture. I wore it with a pair of blue jeans and some ankle cowboy booties. Really cute.  Because I'm tall the length didn't quite hit me below the hips....maybe at the top of my hips. Still nice. It's a keeper.,1
3,Super cute but they feel a little cheaply made. Definitely have to be delicate and careful w them.,0
5,Well I purchased you for my brother and he seems very happy and satisfied will probably purchase again,1
1,to big for use on my wife's head,0
5,I purchased several bands because their comfortable to wear on your wrist or ankle.,1
5,"Loved the sunglasses for my 2 year old, very durable",1
5,Very delicate and beautiful! Love it,1
2,should have gone at least a size larger.,0
3,great looking but legs are too short. i can only wear these with tall boots or as capris. im not even that tall. im 5'5'',0
5,I gave this to my elderly mother and she absolutely loves it!  It's lightweight and has the perfect number of zipped pockets.,1
5,"I love these, amazing price and they fit well. they run small, order a size up.",1
1,These glasses were very small and very crooked. I do not recommend these if you are an adult.,0
5,"Very comfortable. We'll made, looks good. I had bought one before so I knew it was a good deal..",1
2,"I'm 5'8&#34;, 170 and L got a size L because the waist measurement on the chart seemed perfect. UGH! Do not get this dress if you are tall. As in, like taller than 5'6&#34;. I am short-waisted as it is and things are usually too long on me, but the slit up the back ended way to high up if you know what I mean. If I bent over, there would have been quite a show. Will not be buying clothes from this company again. If a dress is going to be this stretchy, a slit up the back seems unnecessary. Will be returning.",0
5,"I was afraid to order these, because I am small, took a change, and they fit me like I want. I also like the material.T",1
5,Beautiful quality and design!  Highly recommend!!,1
4,"Love the cap, very comfortable..but slides off my head in the middle of the night every night!",1
5,Feels amazing!  Super soft inside.  Very warm and comfy!,1
5,Very cute. Very sexy.,1
1,I liked them. but. the quality is very low. after a week of wearing the leg warmers they began to tear. see the photo - a hole on one and loose seams on both. too expensive for a week of use‚Ä¶,0
5,This is perfect decoration for my wallet. Love it!!!!!,1
3,"Runs big, kinda cheap. But its cute for around the house.",0
1,It‚Äôs was ugly,0
4,Smaller than shown in the pictures but still gorgeous.,1
5,Very nice slippers for my granddaughter,1
2,"I bought a large hoping they would be baggy and I could wear them until I transition to maternity clothes.  They were very small!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9-5‚Äô10, 142lbs and they were very short.  Light weight fabric. The black with butterflies was very cute but unfortunately I‚Äôll be returning them due to how small they are.  Also thought they were junior pants based on the size.",0
2,The shoes are cute and well made but they aren‚Äôt true to size. I went up a size and ordered a 10 since my feet are on the wider size and they did not fit. My mom has slim feet and wears a size 8 and they fit her perfectly.,0
5,"OK, this shirt is simply adorable. I love the vibrant colors and the sun/moon design.  I've taken to wearing it as a sleep shirt and love it because it doesn't get all twisted up. The fabric is light, soft, and super comfortable.",1
5,I buying this dress for church and I loved it. I receive a lot of complements. Is comfortable and look nice. I recommended it.,1
5,I like to use these dresses as night shirts.,1
2,I gave it to a friend who loves the suit. The sizes are not correct.,0
5,Excellent quality bands all around.,1
3,It's a bit too long and the sleeves are tight because I have big harms,0
5,I absolutely LOVED this outfit! I got it for my daughters 2nd birthday and it came out just as I expected! The fabric is incredible for the price and I love how vibrant the colors were! Thank you so much! üòä,1
3,I normally wear a medium. I ordered a large this last time. It's still kind of tight. But I really love it.,0
1,These bands are NOT for 38mm 40mm bands! The description is incorrect as shown in my pictures. I have a 40mm series 5 Apple Watch and these bands did not lock in properly because they are not the correct size as stated in the description.,0
5,This is so warm! No need to use a bulky scarf. Happy with product.,1
3,Super cute swim suit and my daughter loves it. My only issue with this is that the leg holes are cut a bit high for a child‚Äôs suit and it shows more of her bum than I would like and it also leads to a lot of wedgies. Aside from that it would be perfect.,0
3,A chain made of spider's web would be sturdier.,0
4,Very durable and classy looking!,1
3,I wasted my money on this very cute but overpriced item.  Maybe I would have loved it more if it bling!,0
3,"Kind of weird looking, but it's a warm hat- outdoor only. My wife says it's an Elmer Fudd hat lol.",0
5,Very pleased,1
4,I found this product off tiktok and it really does the job! Makes my neck feel better while I watch TV from just lying down normally in bed. The lens and mirror did pop out on one of the eyes though after a couple weeks of using them. They do click back in however so it's an easy fix.,1
2,"I liked the shape and length of the necklace, but the item was received completely tangled and the largest stone had fallen out. It did not even seem to fit into the setting for it, so I couldn't even try to glue it back in place. Therefore, I had to return it. The &#34;stones&#34; were definitely cheap (as expected), but probably ok for younger girls...if they're in their proper settings upon arrival.",0
5,"I really like this hat.  It took a LONG time to receive it, but the hat itself is excellent quality and fits well.",1
5,nice cap,1
5,Awesome bag,1
4,Nice fish print. It is a good length but could be longer,1
1,"The band for the Garmin Vivosmart HR is the wrong color blue and one of the straps will not work.  Requested a refund, not getting full purchase price back.",0
1,This product left me very upset. That is because I was not able to see while I was playing basketball,0
5,Very soft & comfortable. Fit true to size. I got a large.,1
3,I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on the dress already. It didn‚Äôt get five stars because there were a couple of places where the seams were ripped or just not sewn together in the first place. Not a big deal for me as I can sew them back up but wanted to be sure others knew especially for the price that there may be some defects.,0
5,"I Helped my son pick out this ring for a man's singer bling. Looks good with his watches and when he dresses up to go out to church to the prom and to school dances. The ring is durable, looks very masculine and goes well with the color of his skin. The price of the Ring was also reasonable and well worth it.",1
5,Great shirts ... thin and comfortable with a perfect fit!!,1
2,Is ok,0
4,"Was looking for a sheer, cheap sock... This fits the bill...  They are not fitted for left or right, but have a generic shape that should fit either foot.  The socks sizing is pretty spot on...",1
5,I Like this pajama. Nice quality.,1
1,Way too small the cut is unflattering and looks nothing like is pictured. As well as the return process is rather drug out and pretty ridiculous,0
4,Comfort,1
5,"Very comfortable, fit well right away.",1
5,I wasn't sure it would fit but I ordered up a size .  I am glad I did .if you have a larger bust I suggest go up a size. Like the sleeves to the elbow. Nice material not to heavy. I would order from this company again.,1
5,"I am a U OF M Graduate!  I was so surprised to find the baseball hat I wanted!  My prior hat was worn out. . .  Now I have a new one-I like it better than my prior hat, because AMAZON has the best of the best!",1
4,I like this but the beads are big,1
3,"The hats are very thick and appear durable. The inner is lined with a faux fur. It is really high-end looking but unfortunately the hats are very ""long""...definitely way to big and tall for a toddler's head...I don't even know if an older child would be able to use it without it covering their eyes. Returning this one unfortunately.",0
5,Great hat!,1
1,Was not a shoe,0
5,Was a little small for my son. Hoping larger sizes or another variation in a larger size becomes available soon.,1
5,Most awesome and handy bag! Finally I found my match! One bag that I can use to carry all my stuff! I love it and it withstands glamorously a lot of weight and expansion! Thank you!,1
3,"The sleeve length and overall fit was as expected BUT the length is very short, not at all the way it looks in the picture.  This length of this cardigan is more like a shrug and hits above the waist. For reference, I am 5'4&#34;, 120 lbs. and I ordered a small.",0
1,Does not fit according to size.,0
2,I do not have much to base this review off other than the fact that they sent me my replacement lens with no nose piece. I tried using my Oakley nose piece and it doesn‚Äôt fit with this lens. So now I am still without eye protection.,0
2,"First of all it took about 3 weeks to be delivered.  Second, I ordered 3 bras, 1 of each color, and I got all white.  I like these very comfortable which is why I bought all 3 colors.  I am not planning to return but very disappointed to get all 3 white.  No reorders from me ever.",0
1,"When I got these one of the ends were chipped and the other crystal fell off before I could wear them. I tried gluing the pieces together and they ended up looking crooked. I was super excited to get these as they were half the price from another retailer, unfortunately I feel like I got about half the quality too.",0
5,Love it,1
2,"Not as expected contains spandex, thought it would be 100% soft organic cotton, disappointed.",0
3,It does shrink easy though and the strings were unusable after washing I did cut them off and product is still wearable,0
5,"Got this for my son and he loved it!  It has a supreme tag inside, so he believes it is authentic.  I can't tell one way or another, but I would recommend.  Great quality and price.",1
1,Una estafa ese reloj,0
1,"It is too small to fit around my girlfriends ankles, she wears a size 9 shoe. Also my girl is five foot eight but only weighs 115 pounds, her ankles are not big.",0
3,Honestly a lot smaller than I thought. I bought other 2in keychains and they were a lot larger. Not sure if I will purchase again.,0
5,"Got these for my son, an architect, who needs a good shoe for some of his work.  They fit well from the start.  Very happy.",1
3,"I ordered this on December 13 and was guaranteed delivery by December 22.  It did not arrive until after Christmas.  This was supposed to be a gift for my 14 year old daughter, because her Grandpa passed in June.  When it finally arrived, after Christmas, she was very happy with it.  She‚Äôs had it for less than a week though and the chain already broke.",0

1,"the gemstone look amazing, the problem is the where the dolphins ends, where the tails connect, is very sharp, really sharp like a knife, we are very disappointed.<br />my wife like it but she cant use it becouse can cut the children or herself.<br />we are thinking what to do.",0
1,I returned it.,0
5,"Muy c√≥modos y bonitos, adem√°s de buen precio",1
1,the top hook broke immediately. so cant wear them at all,0
5,Loved it. Super cute fit and quality is nice.,1

1,Took 3 months to get only to turn my finger green within 4 hours. Don‚Äôt buy.,0
1,Cheap don't buy,0
5,Very nice rain coat. Thick and warm. It was a gift and my granddaughter loved it,1
3,This product was cute and came as described. The reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the packaging. It came in a small box which caused the hat to come bent up and not be able to shape it the way it is supposed to be.,0
1,"Well, where do we put the, uh, boobs?  This dress wraps, but not prettily.  It is tight around the top and flares.  I think it's a hot mess.",0
5,"This looks exactly like the photo and it fits great. I am about 5'5&#34; 120 lbs (with a small chest - 32B/34B) and I ordered a size small. I couldn't really tell what the material would look and feel like from the photo, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It's not thick and not too thin, so I'm sure I'll be wearing it throughout every season if it lasts that long, which I expect it will. If they offered other colors I would probably order them all. Definitely recommend!",1
1,This pin arrived with the actual pin arm already broken off.  I returned it immediately.  I purchased this pin for my daughter's faux fur shawl.  I certainly would not trust this flimsy pin to do the job.  I did not ask for a replacement.<br />The pin does look just like the pictures.<br />The flower is a wine / burgundy color.<br />Pin looks cheap.  Definitely not durable.,0
1,Fits 2 sizes to small. Stretchy cheap material,0
3,"These are perfect when first put on, but stretch out quickly in the day and look funny.",0
5,Very light and comfortable dress.,1
5,Comfy,1

4,My daughter wore this anklet during her wedding. It was the perfect touch. She was happy with the quality for the price.,1
3,It is beautiful. Accents just about anything perfectly and the chain is adjustable,0
5,Bought for my great niece and once she put it on she wouldn‚Äôt take it off.  She‚Äôs a pretty princess just like her twin sister but in a different color.,1
2,"I have a 46"" hip, so ordered 0X as chart indicated.  they turned out to be way too big. the yoke and waist measure 26"" across (52"" around), creating way too much bulk of excess fabric around the tummy when tied up to fit my 40"" waist.  geez, who wants to have a ballooned tummy?  I would suggest ordering the size that correlates to your waist size, even tho it says hip size (no waist size listed) because the waist is every bit as big as the hip.<br />the fabric is crunchy-stiff, thinner-than-a-bedsheet lightweight cotton, somewhat see-thru in white.",0
5,Great!,1
5,I love this item. All of my cards fit into it and I have no need for anything else for my cards.,1
1,Came broken,0
5,nice,1
5,Great for the price! It's very comfortable and looks very cute!,1
5,More seafoam than blue...but well made,1
2,Bib was larger than pictured,0
1,"I never even got to wear this thing. Two of the MOLLE straps ripped off as I was attaching pouches to them. Also just a really awkward design, felt super uncomfortable to try on. Sending this back.",0
5,"Love love love love love it. The colors are spit on, the fabric feels silky and amazing, it doesn't cling to you, very light and flowy, great price and very quick shipping. Very pleased",1
1,"Very hardy, terrible homenaje like workmanship",0
5,The charm Bird of Freedom is absolutely beautiful and more than I expected!,1
5,Excelente calidad,1
5,Love love love it,1
5,Perfect for little kids. They fit just at the knee like perfect soccer socks. They are a nice lightweight cotton but stay up well. My kiddo wears a 6T and a size 2 shoe these are perfect,1
3,But the headband is really uncomfortable.,0
5,Love it! It was Large enough to fit whatever i needed  during my overseas travels.,1
3,"I got this watch and out of the box it was pretty good.  I like my mechanical watches to be accurate, and this watch would gain 2 seconds one day and then lose 2 seconds the next, so overall it was keeping good time.  Then after a few weeks something happened as the movement settled in and it just started losing 8 seconds or more per day.  I looked at regulating the movement (adjusting the accuracy), but it's impossible for a regular watch maker to do.  It needs to go back to Mido for laser regulation.  It is NOT adjustable like a usual ETA movement.  Disappointing!  Pretty watch for sure, but the movement is the heart and soul of a mechanical watch and I was NOT happy with this watch's movement.",0
1,"What a bummer. These shoes didn't even last one month! Chunks of the heel came out, and the sole has a large tear so water can get in. Material on shoe is coming off. They were only worn to school, I know they were cheaper, but I still expected them to last a little longer!",0
5,"It was adorable, was a little big on her, but then again I bought 3 - 6 months for a newborn baby.",1
5,This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry.,1
4,Good construction ran small and my head is small 19 inches in circumference  thought it would fit better,1
5,Saw this on Amazon by chance and got it for my son for Xmas. He never even knew they existed - and it‚Äôs his favorite and most used Xmas present this year. He likes to make TikTok videos with it.,1
5,I loved it use it around the house during summer much lighter to wear and the color cheers me up.,1
2,To hard to adjust. Screw design impossible to adjust on the garment.,0
5,"super light weight and when you get wet they dry so quickly, I bought a few pair of these and will be buying more.  been all I wear this summer",1
2,"Bad fit, mask size runs bigger and covers part of your eyes!!!",0
5,"Beautifully made. Fits like a glove for sure. A little difficult to get on and off because of the perfect body fit. Not sure how to improve on that since people are different in different parts. Otherwise, it is just gorgeous!",1
1,Waste of money,0
5,I like it.  It looks nice and it has done wonders for relieving the pain in my elbows.,1
3,This show is for very narrow feet if the upper portion of the foot is thicker these will not fit. My child wears normal sizes no medium or wide fit.,0
1,"I washed this shirt after i got it , never even wore it ,it went from a xl to not even a small I have never seen such poor quality",0
1,"Too small, fabric is very see-through",0
2,"I like to feel cotton on my skin, but this tank tops are way too small. I am classic XL and I ordered XL, but this is a medium size. I didn't sent it back, just because my daughter, who wears medium, wants them.",0
5,I used this product for my live snake photoshoot! The photographer and I both fell in love with the piece as soon as I put it on !!!! It‚Äôs sturdy and comfortable for sure! Definitely worth getting! I‚Äôll most likely wear it again on a regular day it‚Äôs too cute not too!,1
3,"The color was ok. but the fit was awful, maybe i got it too big, but i'm not sure. I'm 117 lbs. 5'1 the fabric weighted down.",0
5,Comfortable,1
2,lots of bling and dangly disappointed thought the pearl didn't work for me  and it never showed the pearls in the picture.Hmmm might return,0
1,"The button to latch it closed broke within an hour.  Very cheaply made, but I guess you get what you pay for!",0
1,Good value,0
1,"This is a very cheap looking dress. It looks like a house dress, not something you can wear outside of the house.",0
3,"After I tried these shirts on I wondered if I had accidentally ordered the wrong length because the inseam actually measures 11 in instead of 8in. They are extremely comfortable so I‚Äôll keep them for around the house, but they are long enough to look pretty silly.",0
1,Zipper broke not even 4 weeks into school.,0
2,This dress looked terrible on me!  Sent it back,0
3,OK for fun - need to get the real thing,0
5,I love this earring!,1
5,I absolutely love these pants I have nothing bad to say about it five stars!!!üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,1
5,Very pleased with quality and fit.<br />Thanks so very much!!,1
3,I dislike that I ordered for my granddaughter age six too large for her and too small for me. Was confuse,0
1,"This was way to short and sexy for me! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, curvy thighs and butt with a b cup chest. I was going for more of a sweet princess look and this was very sexy. If you‚Äôre wanting sexy this is your dress!",0
3,Looks like the picture but material is made for summer,0
5,Great deal,1
5,Great fit.,1
5,"A not-expensive, great way to dress-up my Apple Watch when I need to. Love the camel color. Soft, good material. Will definitely buy other colors. Hope you come up with other styles.",1
5,Really like it.,1
5,Love it,1
1,"The stones fell out almost immediately.  One earring is missing 3, one is missing 2.",0
5,Excellent watch for that price.,1
5,My granddaughter was thrilled with this gift. 5 stars.,1
5,I just finished my first workout wearing these capris and am completely satisfied.They are super soft and the fit is perfect.I've just ordered a pair of their lounge shorts and I can't wait to get them!,1
1,These do not block blue light. Don‚Äôt waste your money.,0
1,Material is not what I expected. It was to much like polyester.,0
5,"It's a perfectly fine inexpensive shirt that I wear regularly on walks where I want to cover my arms, but I don't want to wear anything that's too hot. It isn't fancy or stylish, but it does the job in mild weather.",1
5,"This is beautiful. The color is the most gorgeous satiny gold. And it is sooo soft. I feel like royalty. Fits well. I'm 5'0"", 130, and the large is perfect! Would definitely recommend!",1
1,The material was really cheap and the size was too big. I would give no stars if it were possible.,0
3,"This is not made the same nor is it the same color. The shoulders on the picture tie up on each shoulder, my version ties around the neck like a halter. The bottom is made totally different as well and they are two totally different materials. My version feels more like a stretchy slinky material if that makes any sense.  Picture on Amazon looks like it would be more of a cotton/light African print material. I did get plenty of compliments and people asking me where I got it from and I didn‚Äôt think I was cute. I did not send it back because I had an event to be to  did not feel like the hassle of returning it so I just kept it.  ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was highly upset at first but now I am over it enough to give it three stars.",0
2,I used it and had no push up in it but dang the design was so so pretty,0
2,This was my second time offering these and I just received the second pack of them and they are cheaply made and not at all what I purchased the first time. These are pure crap this time. I will be sending them back for a full refund. Highly Disappointed!!!!!!,0
1,Horrible! Do not purchase!! Too short and they don't even come laced  :/,0
5,"This pendant looks much nicer in person - very shiny with a clear stone. It is not what I would call delicate, but nor is it overpowering. More of a longer chain kind of look than a choker. The price was ridiculous for the quality. Highly recommend.",1
5,"Super light weight, fits well with a nice silhouette and does an amazing job as a wind breaker.  I live in the south so we don't need heavy jackets but we do still need to be warm and this is a great, low cost option that you can roll up and store in your glove box as your extra ""car coat"".  I would purchase this again.",1
2,I love the vest but the one size fit all is a joke. They need to redesign the size or make bigger. I am a 225 guy and this fits snug,0
1,They fall off your face.  Don't buy them I wasted my money.,0
1,The buckle broke on our first trip using the straps!,0
5,Exactly as pictured and good quality,1
5,"Great short set for even better price! I bought three sets for my 8 year old son to play outside in and they fit great, are durable and keep him comfortable.",1
5,"Love, love, love my new sunglasses!! I get soo many compliments on them.",1
2,"These shorts have a dropped crotch which make them very awkward to run in. They don't look good, and the compression part is way longer than it needs to be.",0
1,Ordered up it fit in chest fine but the waist is cut very small,0
3,"These jeans were super cute, but way smaller than the size I ordered. I usually wear a 14 and the 14-16 would not even pull all the way up.",0
5,wood watch. Pretty cool,1
3,Heavy fabric though it is synthetic. Shirt hangs on the arms oddly.,0
5,:),1
3,On the smaller size. My daughter is a 7/8 and is very thin and the medium belt barely fits her.,0
2,"These worked really well until suddenly for no apparent reason the R arm broke off of the pair I was wearing. Under a month and I am having to start the complaint process. At this point, I have no idea what they will say or do. I don't want to have to go to the hassle of returning them, but I really need them because of the amount of time I spend on the computer at work. I am so disappointed!",0
5,I liked it. Good fit,1
5,"lightweight, breathable, and moisture wicking. Doesn't get in the way of my eyes or mouth. does the job comfortably.",1
2,"I can use it without zipping it up but it is too small, it said US 2xl but fits like a US L",0
5,beautifully made and flattering fit.,1
1,"I wasn't happy when I received these. When I ordered the 2012 Red Book on State coins Amazon said people who bought the book also bought this jeweler's loupe. They are much smaller than I expected, to small as far as I'm concerned for looking at coins!<br />I was going to send them back but my husband took one for his shop and my Father took the other.",0
1,Always been a fan of the crye pants and thought I would give this a try as a backup pair. The number of pockets is nice but the stitching is  very poor. The knee insert covers ripped after less than a week of bounding movements.,0
3,"I got this for my neighbor as a gift. The pug charm itself was bigger than I expected and I'm not sure who would want that hanging from their neck, but that's where the alternate options came in handy. We made it into a keychain and she put it on her keys. Unfortunately, within a few days, the clasp somehow opened and the dog charm got lost.",0
1,It serves the purpose but everyone comments that it‚Äôs Too bulky and the color is horrible.<br />Get it in black and not green.<br />Make sure you get screen protection.,0
4,"I have had this product for two days now. The watch itself is very nice and heavy. You can see the quality of the work for the mechanics of the watch on the backside. However, the band feels a bit cheap, which can be easily replaced. I have tried on other watches for this price and not many can compare to the quality that this watch has to offer. Would have given this product 5 stars, but the band drops it down to 4.",1
4,Bought this for my daughter love it,1
4,"Very pretty, nice length but runs a little bit small. I'm a true medium but should of gotten a large.",1
2,These earrings are hideous. I guess you get what you pay for. They are so huge! And GOLD! I guess if I am ever a gypsy for Halloween I can use these!,0
1,Did not come with key. Unable to use. Very disappointing.,0
1,"Horrible fabric. It's a shiny, very cheap feeling fabric. Just hate it.",0
2,First time I put them on one of the posts bent and broke when I tried to straighten it.  Threw the pair in the trash.  Hope the same thing does not happen to the second pair.  -disappointed-,0
2,"I thought this was an actual blazer, with ruched sleeves.  It's really more of a slinky sweater-jacket,  It's actually a nice thing, but not at all what I needed, and not what I thought I was ordering.  I am going to return it.",0
4,"Bought for my husband, nice shirt, good fit",1
5,"I ordered a total of 6 necklaces from this seller. Nothing was more than $6, so don't expected top dollar quality from the items, but I still think they are nice enough for daily wear in the office or as costume jewelry. With that said, all the necklaces looked as pictured and the colors are pretty exact. Shipping was much faster than expected and was originally quoted to be 24-35 days from order, but arrived only 8 days from order!",1
1,"Pretty pattern, but ran small.",0
3,I ordered these for my daughter that is in a size 2 and they were too small.,0
5,I love this product it works really well!! üíñüíñüíñüíñ,1
5,Beautiful just beautiful worth the money indeed. Looks just like picture.,1
3,Liner ripped after a couple months and the shoulder strap never stays where you adjust it to stay. But besides those fairly big issues I really like the bag.,0
1,Not as pretty as it looks in photos. Totally over paid for it. Could have gotten a prettier cover up at a big box retailer,0
5,I Recommend them,1
4,Got my boyfriend and I one each for Saint Pete Florida's Pride festival and a lot of people kept complimenting us on them.  Sizing was a bit larger than we both normally wear but we shrank them a bit when washing them and it turned out fine.  Very comfy and a good attention grabber.  Really cute to wear as a couple's outfit for sure.,1
1,Really unhappy. Ordered an xl for DD size top. It doesn‚Äôt fit an A cup.,0
2,"Very difficult to put in and close. Caused my ear to become infected despite being cleaned well, which is not a problem I've had before.",0
2,XL fit more like a M/L. The color was as expected,0
5,Husband like how he can see the clarity in things.,1
5,"Had to return for bigger size, but like the top.",1
5,"The product worked wonders on my Timberland Boots, not as great on my Clarks Wallabees but still cleaned them up a little bit.",1
3,This is actually a really cute skirt but a large is about a size 6/7 In juniors. US sizes.,0
5,Works great,1
5,Love these.,1
5,Nice shirt,1
3,"I don't like the open shoulder, it feels like your bra strap has fallen down.",0
2,I found these stocking uncomfortable to wear and difficult to take off at night.,0
2,"Didn't protect my phone at all... pretty, but clearly not a case - more of a decoration.",0
1,The band broke just after a week of wearing it. Not good quality,0
4,It looks exactly like the picture. The material used was great but it the neck piece holder broke within a month. I just keep it as a little charm now.,1
3,The color is more of a marigold yellow than the bright yellow I thought it would be.,0
1,This product is very cheaply made size is very off n I payed way to much for what I received,0
5,Great look and great quality! Love the fit too!,1
5,"This headgear rivals the expensive brands that were very prevalent along the trail. I never used the front sunblocking ""bandit"" attachment, but had it in case the sun got too much. Good venting, double wall airspace bill, nice long panels, good graytone color, not too bright. Buy it.",1
4,I ordered 2 pairs of shoes from this brand and my comments are the same for both shoes. I wear US 8.5 (39 Eur) and the fit is exact - perhaps a bit too exact! My toes and heel are literally hanging over the ends of the shoe. Cute but these are slightly sticky points for me.<br /><br />UPDATED: I've updated my review from 3 stars to 4 stars because these shoes are extremely comfortable. Feels like walking on a cloud.,1
5,This was a much better looking peice after receiving. It worked out better than expected.,1
4,"[[VIDEOID:604b087db7b0c769dcd1e0f5a711bbb]] I like that they are small, the price is right,<br />And made well. I loose earrings all the time and with this price I won‚Äôt be upset when I do.",1
5,Love it although had to say that the claps in the bag were not so easy to figure out.<br />Once I got the hang of it I can put it on and off easily,1
2,This hat is too small. Hurts my ears and head and it has an adjustable thing on it but it's as loose as it gets and I can BARELY get it on my head. I would return but it's been too long now.<br />Also the way it's sewn is weird.. it doesn't lay flat anywhere...,0
5,LOVE IT!!!!! I have no complaints yet.,1
1,I wish i would off went one size small,0
3,"If you‚Äôre looking for something stylish, this looks like a bandaid. I‚Äôm fine with just the build quality",0
3,"Good purple color, bleeds on 1st wash but VERY strong stinky chemical smell.  Washed 3 times now and the smell is mostly gone but makes me wonder what it's really made of.  Probably would not buy from this company again.  Amazon has other companies selling this type of product and those have arrived with no smell.  Cannot recommend this vendor.",0
1,Garbage,0
3, ,0
1,The pattern at the waist does not line up at all making the lines crooked. There is absolutely no way to make it look straight because the pattern is so far off at the waist. I am so disappointed because this dress would have been pretty if it actually looked like the photo online.,0
1,"They say EASY ON and OFF, but they come with a page of directions showing how to get them on.  Even so, it is all but impossible.  Getting them off at night when you are tired and your legs have swollen a bit is even harder.  I thought I was going to have to cut them off.  They also left sores just below my knees where the top bands rubbed, and after the first wearing (8 hrs) there was a split in the fabric.<br /><br />They are awful, Awful, AWFUL, A W F U L.",0
4,"Received the coat and love it so far. Runs small, so ordered up as suggested by the seller. This coat is true to the seller's pictures. Haven't worn ot yet but am initially happy with my purchase..",1
3,"These pants are so cute, but unfortunately they‚Äôre see through. So I have to wear a duster or long cardigan so my butt doesn‚Äôt show at work",0
4,The softest burp cloths I have found. They are cozy to the touch and are still absorbent which is a must. A little on the pricey side for 3 but the quality is worth it for sure.,1
5,My new favorite tshirt. Comfortable. Not clingy Great fabric,1
5,These are my favorite earrings (for when I wear blue)!  They appear well-made & I re rive many compliments on them.,1
3,top too large and bottom way too too small,0
1,Was really looking for a pair that didn't but right away these rode right up and bunched up at the top. Super uncomfortable. Pretty bummed to be frank,0
5,"I love this dress! It is so comfortable and lightweight! As soon as I wore it one day, I bought the same dress in pink and plan to get the other colors. Wearing it is effortless - just perfect for the summer months!! This dress is, in my opinion, an excellent value - I wear it at least once during the week and once on the weekend. :)",1
5,Glasses are great and durable. Fit nicely,1
4,Precio econ√≥mico no se puede esperar m√°s,1
5,"Love these --they are the Goldilocks of (bifocal) sunglasses: not too dark (and they are big enough to shade the eyes at the same time), not too tight, and not too heat. They are wonderful!!!",1
1,It was too short(I‚Äôm 5‚Äù7 and it came to just below my ankles). The crotch area was so baggy! This outfit wasn‚Äôt form fitting at all. It fit was nothing like the picture.,0
1,"Yup, they're light weight; Other than that they have no advantage whatsoever over an ordinary steel ring. The square stock makes it difficult to slip keys on. Keys or accessories w/ small round holes won't turn freely instantly making your key ring bulky and unwieldy....And, if you slip a thick, plastic coated key off 2-3 times the material becomes fatigued, stretches and leaves a gap. Junk. Save your money.",0
1,it came broken i couldn‚Äôt slide the band into my watch face because the metal part was broken and sticking up.,0
3,Way way to small,0
5,Attractive STYLE and easy to set time and day.,1
3,Breaking too quickly,0
5,my husband loves them better quality them polarized ones that are weak on sides,1
3,Kind of uncomfortable for me and didn't hug me well. Did keep things contained during my workouts.,0
1,UGH! I love this color (black with red trim) but it came in broken. Very disappointed. The band was separated from the clasp.,0
2,Does not flow like this on the picture. Ordered an med and it was way too short but both med and large were way to big around the shoulders.,0
2,"Maybe this is my bad for not reading the description close enough, but when it said the wrist length was adjustable I assumed this band would work for me.  Unfortionatly what I realized is that this band can only be adjusted to smaller sizes.  It doesn't come with any extra links, and the defaut size it comes as may be too small for some people.",0
5,"Beautiful in color, great fit",1
3,Not worth the money,0
2,I bought an XL and it honestly looked like a small. It was so tiny,0
3,too small,0
4,It is an ok gym shorts,1
3,Very very tiny,0
2,Cheap ties that only last one or two uses before wrinkling and looking terrible. Buy silk ties.,0
3,You get what you pay for,0
1,The fit was fine but there is a seam that runs along one side in the front that is very uncomfortable & left a red intention in my skin that hurt. They aren't inexpensive. Overall disappointed.,0
2,I ordered 5 of this item and all of them looked different. Some ears didn't have the white triangles and the tails were all very short.,0
1,These are not good at all and I can not return them? What BS. They are not the strength they say they are.,0
5,Love it and it first perfect!,1
2,They look nice but the first day I used it they changed color.,0
5,Order up a size because it runs small.,1
1,Broke with in an hour.,0
3,Cheap and small,0
4,looked great but seemed close although ordered a size up.  Didnt last him 6 months,1
5,"Super soft lining and very warm.  The wool on this one is a tad scratchy around the edges. However, I have another one in a different color that is SO SOFT and no scratchy wool.  Highly recommend.",1
5,Really durable and cute,1
3,Zip broke before i even got a chance to wear it (So disappointed). Otherwise a very nice skirt!,0
3,Seems to be very light plastic but should last a while.,0
1,"So, full disclosure... I ordered this same dress but in a smaller size (XL) and different color (navy) in May. I returned it, as I went with a different dress. I said I'd come back around to this one, but get a larger size next time for more room in the booty.<br /><br />So I came back around for the XXL in burgundy, which appears more of a deep red in the ad pics and customer review pics. This dress I got today is purple, y'all. Not an ugly color, I'm just looking for more of a red. And the XXL is waaayyyyyy too big on top,  with barely any difference on bottom from the XL. I'm a pear shape, but not *that* extreme of a pear. This must have been cut for top heavy or broad shouldered ladies. I'm neither. I also don't like the hem.... looks unfinished (if you sew, you know what I mean when I say it's just &#34;serged&#34; and not turned). Even though it's a great price, I still wouldn't keep it.",0
3,for larger heads,0
5,I just love these pants! Wish I could wear them everyday ive has tons of compliments too!,1
3,Idk what I did wrong he asked for it.,0
5,"Beautiful, feminine and soft. I love it.",1
5,Excellent product,1
5,I love this keychain! I bought two and I gave the other one to my daughter and she absolutely loves it!,1
5,The chain wasn‚Äôt long enough for my boyfriend,1
5,"Beautiful, soft fabric, not see through, good quality, true to color & size!",1
3,Very nicely made jacket and sharp looking. Ordered XL but jacket definitely much smaller compared to other XL jackets in my wardrobe.,0
5,"Great, Durable, it fits my HP Notebook which is huge and heavy. Lots of pockets. Straps don't hurt my shoulders that much and are easy to adjust.",1
5,Perfect way to keep chapstick with me. We live where it's pretty warm year round and I would often forget my chapstick because you can't leave it in the car here. Now I always have it with me! This item is quality and I will probably gift some this Christmas as well for the convenience it has provided me. Highly recommend!,1
2,to small,0
1,This blouse is cut extremely small. You will need 3 sizes bigger. But the material is good,0
5,These are stunning.  I can't wait to wear these!,1
4,It was too big,1
5,Outstanding quality ! Definitely worth the money,1
5,"When you buy Carters, you know you're getting a great product. And we did. Washes up nice and keeps soft.",1
4,Runs a little bigger than expected but seems like a good quality suit for the price. We will see how it holds up on the boat this summer!,1
5,"Cute little handbag, especially comfortable for long walks and evening dinners.",1
5,"The pajama is beautiful, well made, soft, breathable and comfortable. Beautiful design on it too. The doll piece is a beautiful as thr kids one. My niece wore it in her birthday as her doll did and she was very comfortable and happy with it.",1
2,They are very hard to get of the paper but they serve their purpose . I ruined two of them trying to get them off .,0
3,"Cheap sunglasses that scratch and damage very easily, but good if you want sunglasses to leave in your car.",0
1,"All though they look high quality, they are a waste of money.  I have tried to put them on a brand new pair of glasses 6 time and they DON""T STICK.  Read and followed the included instructions to the letter but they are still in the box.<br />Sorry I bought these.",0
4,Color,1

5,I work in Healthcare<br />We use white nets to cover our hair I find unattractive so I ordered the caps from Amazon<br />My coworker Love the caps very professional looking .  Now it‚Äôs a trend,1
5,"Nice looking watch, comfortable to wear, clear glass and excellent price for it",1
2,"All pieces arrived, packaged great.  After wearing the blue swirls for one week, I took them out to gauge up only to notice that the black dots had vanished. Same with the white tunnels, the dots can literally be rubbed off.  Also, on one of the tunnels, it chipped when unscrewing it.  Maybe acrylic isn't the way to go.",0
2,"I bought the masks to use for an upcoming cruise.  When I received it, it had 3 pieces to each mask.  I found it difficult to put it together so gave to my daughter to try (shes 57) and she could not either figure out how to get the plastic thing on the mask to hold it together.  Would rather pay a few cents extra and have the masks all together",0
4,"My son is still not a pro at walking, but he loves the outdoor so we make sure he gets his 'outdoor' playtime. This is great to protect his knees because it is very soft and it seems like he's comfortable wearing it. The material is great and it's very easy to wash. I am giving it a four star, because I would literally have to keep adjusting it whenever he's doing a lot of movements; it may have to do with the fact that his legs are a bit chunky.<br />Note: I was able to purchase this during the company's promotion for truthful reviewing purposes.",1
3,"Better done costume. This must be put in over-the-head as there are no closures. I had to safety pin my own darts into the waistline to create a waist. This is likely due to the fact the Child cannot otherwise get the dress on. She had to have her arms outstretched, then I had to carefully pull the dress over her and down while helping her fish her arms into the sleeves and face through the neck hole, etc.<br /><br />The length is perfect and the skirt is full. When you add the darts with careful placement in the tush area, you won‚Äôt need a petticoat. However, a slip is necessary or some shorts. This is a simple cotton woven fabric and quite sheer. Proper undergarments are necessary.",0
3,"I thought an Angel mask would be cool to have, but it's not a great mask outside of aesthetics...and even then I have some issues with it.<br /><br />It's nice that it has a bendable nose piece, but the way the fabric is cut it's not form fitting to the face, so the fabric bunches and crinkles which messes up how the mask looks. I tend to lose the spots above the fangs due to bunching. I do not have a small head/face and this mask is still large on me.<br /><br />The thin ""filter"" inserts are a joke. Leaving them in, you end up with a weird looking, stiff, flat panel over your mouth. Leave them out and you still have that unnecessary extra panel of fabric bunching up under the mask.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what this fabric is, but even though it is much thinner than my cotton masks, this silky mask is harder to breathe through and fogs my glasses more.<br /><br />The ear pieces are adjustable, but the elastic is so thin I worry about breaking it if I mess with it too much. Over all, not a mask I end up wearing too often if I want to take my health seriously.",0
1,One of the earings came broke.,0
4,"These are warm, soft & work with the computers at work. They were a good buy!",1
5,"I didn't think I'd use the handy wrist strap for this shaving kit bag, but when I finished packing my suitcase and saw I forgot to pack the shaving kit, and there was no room left in the suitcase, I just slipped the wrist strap over the suitcase handle and problem solved (road trip, not air travel....).  There is a zippered pocket on the outside to store thin items without having to open the main bag and rummage through it.  There is another zippered pocket on the inside, as well as some open pockets.",1
2,I find it difficult to believe this is 100% cotton. It looks & feels like 100% polyester. I bought it to ice dye. Had to send it back.,0
1,Came ripped. Horrible quality. Sending it back. Demanding a refund.,0
3,"I like the fabric, but the fit is strange. It runs large. I ordered a small based on the size chart, but wish there was an XS option.",0
1,The glasses look good but the earpieces have already broken off. I had to glue them back together.,0
3,BETTER FOR MY DAUGHTER. IT WAS TOO SHORT FOR ME,0
4,Good item,1

5,I like everything about this product,1
5,"I bought this dress to wear at my son's outdoor Spring wedding in May. It's dressy and classy for a wedding, yet the style is still appropriate for an outdoor event. I am 5'3"", 110 lbs and the size small fit perfectly. The color is rich, and the fabric is comfortable. I'm happy with my purchase!",1
4,"Noticing more skin irritation with this band than the original one.  But it is manageable, so I will continue to wear - just not everyday.",1
1,They are not true to size.,0
2,Tacky,0
2,"Ordered these socks as they say will fit mens size 10.  They run very small, and washed them once and they shrunk to a very small size.  Too bad.  Will give them to a lady we know.",0
1,Pass on by this hat! It came smashed in a tiny bag. Way to small!! I am extremely disappointed with this hat. Color was a lot more faded then the picture it looks like it was worn for several years definitely not new! No response from seller either.,0
1,"It was missing a set before I even opened it. Very poor quality. I have ordered some of this Statement jewelry before and was pleased, but not this time. May think twice before ordering again.",0
3,"They aight, a little thinner than I may have liked. Kinda tough to open and close",0
4,Very comfortable! Fit as expected and arrived on time. The price was right too!,1
5,Beautiful classy fragile. Was a gift. Compliments all around,1
3,"I love the style of this shirt and the fit, but it is sheer and pilled badly after one wear. Washing didn't help and it is now my around the house top. If you are looking for this style top, look for one made of 100% Polyester. That is what my other split neck blouses are and they are best.",0
5,The way it fits  And the way it feels,1
3,"I normally wear women's size L to XL, 16-18. I do not have skinny legs by any means. I ordered the same leggings in sizes S/M and L/XL because I was not sure how they would fit. They both were too big. The S/M size fit better (amazing since I never fit in that size), but was loose from mid thigh down and would gather around the knee area. I didn't check if they seemed see through because once it didn't fit right I took them off. The Halloween pattern is very cute. I would have kept the size S/M size and dealt with the gathering for the Halloween fun wearing, but not for the price of $17.99 +tax. MAYBE for like 9 bucks it would be okay for the limited use they would get. They felt smooth and silky. They were thin, but felt nice on. Still not sure if see through though.",0
3,Hard to get the back open to put your fitbit in.,0
5,Absolutely beautiful!,1
4,Works as expected so far.,1
5,Love this dress. Easy to take care of. Quick iron job. Like 10 minutes and you‚Äôre done. Love the pockets. Nice/perfect for summer or just comfort. Hides my fat perfectly. Wear with a bra or not. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 about 145lbs. Had 2 kids so I have a belly to hide. The length is just perfect for flat sandals or wedge heels.,1
1,Ordered an extra large 2X it barely fit .  Should list this as a non US size !,0
2,Item that came is not what is pictured,0
5,It's beautiful! I love it .,1
5,This is the second pair of these glasses I purchased so I can keep them in each of my vehicles.  They are great. I use them every evening and when it rains.,1
5,I love it!,1
5,My mother loves it.,1
2,"I bought this as it was the ONLY option for me at 30 weeks to wear to a Cleveland browns game. It is thin, the writing looks like it was ironed on and the shirt is a bad fit. It fit my stomach but it was very baggy and short on the length. NOT worth spending all the money on this product.",0
3,"It is very hard to install, bad fit into watch.",0
1,"This necklace was broken when it arrived. The chain was tied together in a knot to make it look like it was ok. There was no clasp to hook the necklace together. So I took one off an old necklace to fix it. I ordered two, the first one the stones we're all offset, so I had to pop them out and reglue the. Nice necklace if it was a complete product.",0
5,Sock fits well and feels great while running. Your feet don't feel wet after running like they do in regular socks. A must have for any runner.,1
5,Loved it!,1
3,the shoes are smaller or there feet are bigger,0
3,Cute product but seems to run a bit small and be snug.,0
3,"The earring itself is very nice and fits right ,but the tip came broken :/ That was very disappointing. I'm going to try and fix it with hot glue, but considering the price, it's ok. That's why I gave it a three. Very nice earring,but very disappointing for the company to send it broken.",0
5,The color and style of this watch band is amazing,1
5,awesome !,1
5,"I love this!!! I did receive it broken but after a few quick emails the problem was solved. I received the blue one. It is not baby blue like the picture but more of a dark blue, Personally i like it better. It looks amazing on and everyone compliments it!",1
1,"Outfit, made of thin fabric, arrived with marker marks on the fabric, despite that it was in a zippered bag inside a box. Contacted seller who offered a $5 refund if the marks did not come out after a washing. Marks did not come out after washing.",0

5,Love it! This ring is very classy and very thin on the sides. So happy to find one in real gold that I hope will last for years to come!!,1
1,This is NOT Tourmaline! It is plastic! I will be fileing a complaint for false advertising!,0
3,Cozy n made my outfit pop,0
5,Met all expectations,1
5,These are so cute! Stayed on all day.,1
5,"Being female this Lg. was a bit roomy, im 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 170.....so it was perfect round the house, errands running shirt, love it, comfy, goid colors....good length.  Now cotton will shrink so have to see from there....",1
1,Shirt is short and shrunk on first wash,0
4,"Good quality, but I was a little surprised to find out it is see through.",1
3,Less than ideal fit. Barely stays on face even with adjusting,0
2,Bow came off on the first wear,0
5,Beautiful ‚ô•Ô∏è  piece of jewelry.,1
2,"Beautiful, but the back fell off shortly after I started wearing it and I haven't been able to find it since.  It also hurts to sleep on because it is pretty large.",0
5,I liked everything about this product.....delivered as expected and was kept abreast of arrival time. All communication was current  and the whole operation went smoothly especially at a very busy time of year. Very happy grandson who loved this sweatshirt...well worth the wait. Thank you,1
4,"Lovely but too long and large, I made a mistake and ordered a medium and I think the small would have been much better. It's really a beautiful pair of pants/skirt (skort?) and nice fabric but I think I need to be taller to wear it. I'm wearing 4 inch heels with it and have it tied tightly in the back. I think it's truly lovely and would recommend it to anyone who thinks they can pull it off. I am 5'5 and 110 lbs with a slight pear shape for reference.",1
5,"Follow the customer reviews! I am a size 27/28 in jeans, 135 lbs and I ordered the XL and it fits perfect! Print is cute, material is good.. i will probably order again in another color.",1
3,"This is a very pretty dress, however I am going to try and return it (I say try because note this ships from China, and it may be way to expensive to return).  I feel the dress should be titled ‚Äújunior dress‚Äù. It seems more like a dress for a young woman or older teenager, more than a ‚ÄúMother Dress‚Äù.  It looks great on the really thin model in the picture.  I just didn‚Äôt feel that comfortable in it.  Also, please note the picture of the back of the dress.  I was most surprised that it is not a zipper or buttons, but laces.  This is a good concept for fitting, as it makes it adjustable...  but you must have someone to help lace it up as you cannot do it and then put it on, and then help needed to lace it down to get out of it too.  Overall it was an inexpensive dress and it does appear like an inexpensive dress.",0
2,"Cute shoe but the buckle is very weird. Instead of being a real buckle, or a faux buckle with Velcro fastener, this shoes closes by looping a hook across the strap and over the top of the buckle. If the strap pushes forward though it could easily release since the hook is not all the way closed. It is weird. My daughter couldn't figure it out. It took me a while to figure out how to close it. If my daughter needs help at school it would take another adult a while to figure it out, too. I sent them back.",0
4,"The necklace part itself breaks easily and had to be replaced with a different string and chain a few times. The One Piece logo charm itself is really nice in color when you first get it but keep out of sun and water, it will change colors over time but a lot quicker if you do not take care of it. Logo itself is durable and lasts a while. Would be a great gift or just to keep as a necklace.",1
1,"It was sewn incorrectly so it fit perfectly, but only on one side.  Returned.",0
1,"Honestly I was really excited to get these masks. But I was really disappointed with it. First of all they are not as elastic as one would believe. So getting them over my head on and off is hard. Plus they leave little white beads of cotton or some kind of material all over me when I take it off. They are in my hair, my beard, my shirt, everywhere. Needless to say I was not too impressed this product.",0
5,"I was on the fence about this cute little cami top. I was afraid the material would be like a nightgown from the 60s but it's surprisingly soft and stretchy. I ordered this in white and it isn't see through. It has adjustable straps and accommodates a large bust very well. It is very flattering and the little flowers around the neckline add a nice, feminine touch. I definitely want to order more colors!",1
4,"It‚Äôs a pretty serviceable belt. I don‚Äôt know if I got an off batch because one of my grommets popped out where I buckle it. I never buckle my belts tight, so I don‚Äôt know what happened. If I need a new replacement, I‚Äôd give it a chance.",1
4,"If you are, say a large, then you better order 2 to 3 sizes bigger...just saying it is a small fit.",1
3,Came defective can‚Äôt really give a review,0
5,Purchased to wear under low necks without adding another layer.  Works perfectly,1
1,Wasted money they broke while trying to put them on.,0
1,It broke the second I unlatched it to try on.,0
3,"The dress is beautiful.  However, I ordered an xl as I usually wear a 16-18 and it was HUGE! I am about 5'8&#34; and about 200 lbs.  I am going to return and order a large. I will post a new review for that order. Also, for any that may be wondering - the liner stops at the knee, but is full so no worries about it being too tight.  I would say the safe bet on ordering this would be to order based on your top half as the bottom is plenty full enough.",0
2,Sent the shirt back because the colors weren‚Äôt has shown. The white is more like off white and the black is more like dark brown,0
1,"Edges after one, delicate wash, cold water, frayed and tired apart",0
4,Love the quality when worn. I only wash them in cold water on a gentle cycle but after a couple of washes the seams open up - otherwise great feel to the skin when wearing them.,1
1,"If you are a plus size, don't even bother. This shirt runs about 3 sizes smaller in real life than what the specs say.",0
3,"Perfect size for a teenage girl for school.<br />Doesn't want big or heavy<br />So perfect to carry school ID, money for lunch and of course her cell",0
1,Waaayyy too small.,0
3,I had this necklace less than a week and the chain has popped broken.,0
1,Doesn‚Äôt fit on an adults head!,0
3,Good quality but tooo big!!,0
1,Not the same like a picture.,0
1,"Was excited to get this lock and extension to use with my bike. However today it arrived and the extension bar was missing from the package, meaning I received just the combo lock. It is basically useless without both parts. I don‚Äôt need just a combo lock. The first thing I did was check the box to see if it fell out. It wasn‚Äôt there. The other issue is, I don‚Äôt want to be penalized for returning it so, basically it is a loss. And I would not recommend this item. I cannot recommend something I did not receive.",0
5,"I've been carrying a back pack 5 days a week for 6 years for work to carry everything from lunch to some basic tools. I replaced it recently with this crazy ants bag and it's fantastic they have a super efficient use of space and lots of pockets. I can store 3 drinks a Tupperware with a sandwich plus my work stuff flash light,knife, key chain,glasses amoung other stuff. It's gone over so well in my house my daughter and wife will be getting one next week. If you want a great EDC pack this is it. There are numerous ways to carry this bag it is ameidextrous and has great back padding. The clips it has are strong and won't come unclipped easily.",1
5,"Love, love, love this dress! So glad I ordered the package deal with the petticoat, makes such a huge difference in appearance. When I tried this on, I got a ""Whoa!"" from the husband. My kids love it because of the ""twirly skirt."" Will update my review once I've worn it out!",1
4,"Material is buttery soft, ordered the large, and it is very large which is exactly what I wanted! Plenty of pockets for all my cards, just filled it up and it's already bulging, but I love it :) great buy, I'm happy so far!<br /><br />*around 2 weeks after purchase, coin zipper handle broke off in the closed position, so it it broke off with my coins trapped inside :/",1
5,Super cute,1
4,This is super cute and stretchy but it was too small for me. I‚Äôm so sad they don‚Äôt have the white color in the next size up! I ended up returning it.,1
5,great deal,1
5,great birthday gift idea for a fan. My niece loved this so much. The colors were bright and it was as advertised.,1
5,Absolutely stunning. I purchased this for my friend as her birthday gift. She loved it so much she put it on immediately. It was a perfect fit! It ties around the waist and gave her the perfect hour glass figure.,1
5,These are great for the price. The pocket in the front even fit my iPhone X! Stay up well during active classes such as yoga and barre.,1
5,"Good fit, cute shirt",1
5,"Got so many compliments, super cute! A bit see through but oh well, they‚Äôre PJs & it wasn‚Äôt too bad. The top is cropped a bit",1
5,Exactly what our Granddaughter needed.  It fit perfect and she simply loved it!!!,1
4,Okay fit,1
5,Love this sweater. It fits me just right. I enjoy my clothes fitting not tight. This sweater does not hug my curves which I like. I am about 200 lbs and have some extra weight in my belly and this sweater does not fit snug at all.,1
2,Received my hat today and straight out of the box the hat was broken in several spots and bent beyond repair. Photos included.,0
4,Arrived early and has stood up to daily use quite well. My only complaint is that the pins they sent with it to attach to the watch were to large to even fit the band.,1
4,"Good value for the price. Only minus is that the neck/collar is a little high and tight, almost like a mock turtleneck.",1
5,Perfect fit and a very neat sewing job..neat as in tidy and professional. I've already worked out a few times in them and they don't move or slip off of my head. I love these headbands!,1
5,Great. He loves it. BUT... fit is smaller than expected.,1
1,DOES. NOT. TELL. TIME. This is a joke of a watch. It's very cute but it's useless if it does not perform its main function. The time was consistently behind even after adjusting multiple times. Over a 1 hour period it would be behind at least 15 minutes. THIS IS A PROBLEM. Returned.,0
5,Great product.. Turns several colours when you turn the top of it clockwise..,1
5,Will protect skin from harmful sun rays.,1
2,Don't like these at all. They are cute but too hard for my 8 year old to put on.,0
4,Cute little pin. Nice sentiment. Of the two pieces I received one was imperfect. The white color on the wing  was covering the metal details of the word Bee.,1
5,Very Sexy,1
1,"I purchased this watch strap a year ago. I liked the whole concept behind the so called ""NATO strap"" that is, a safeguard against one of the two strap pins unlatching and losing your watch somewhere like in the ocean where a recovery could be almost impossible. What I never imagined however, was the possibility that the cheap ""buckle tongue"" could easily slip under the buckle to the other side releasing the entire watch strap altogether.",0
5,Super duper adorable! Fits my son perfectly.,1
1,Feel like wearing sandpaper underwear.,0
1,This is not what I expected at all. The colors are bright and look good in picture but it's such a cheap polyester fabric. It doesn't flow and is just horrible. This should be written off as a scam . It comes all the way from China so there's no point even returning it . Big Fail,0
1,iPhone 6 barely fits and doesn't fit with any cover.,0
3,"It‚Äôs an okay idea.<br /><br />The issues:<br />Sound hardware moves around<br /><br />Buttons are very cheap sounding, like they click and you are fearful they will break<br /><br />The battery life isn‚Äôt horrible, it just represents the cost.",0
5,Great product! Great value!,1
2,Dislike....fabric,0
5,Grandsons love them.,1
4,"Very cute bag, small. I use it for a camera lens. Don't buy if you're looking for a lot of space. The strap was much shorter than I'd hoped.",1
5,Great stylish watch for a cheap price.,1
5,"I love this suit! I can‚Äôt say that about any other one piece swimsuits that I have. The material is great. I love that I can pull the straps just the right way to fit my bust and body. I feel like I‚Äôm covered up, but still in a sexy/flattering way. My husband even likes it! I decided to buy it in a few different colors/styles  and they all fit the same. The black one feels maybe a little smaller in the butt.",1
2,"They were definitely no-show when I wore them with my dress shoes. However, they did not stay secure after a short walk with them on. The elastic was not strong enough to keep the heel secured despite the gel grip within the heel of the sock.",0
3,"I have pretty feminine small hands. My middle finger measures just under 8.5cm and a palm size of about 20.5cm. These gloves did not fit me, they were just shy of fitting perfectly. I think it‚Äôs more accurate to say they‚Äôre 8cm gloves or maybe juuuust a bit smaller. The main issue though is the thumb, the fingers were only a few millimeters short of fitting me but the thumb was another story, it was like a baby thumb size. But to those who buy these and can‚Äôt quite fit them worry not! You can simply cut the tips off the fingers, or down to the knuckle if you‚Äôd prefer, then  reinforce the seam by turning the gloves inside out and sewing up the ends to make sure it doesn‚Äôt unravel, and boom! They‚Äôll fit perfectly. With an added benignity of making typing on your phone easier. Plus! The gloves are just tight enough to wear rings with them on.",0
5,I freaking love this dress. The colors ate so vibrant. Material is thick and stretchy. Great quality.  So many compliments. Great for work. I JUST LOVE IT wish it was in different colors!!!,1
5,"Awesome product and price! Good buy, will buy again.",1
3,"This is an adorable dress. However, the top is a smaller size than the dress. So I will have to find another one. The material is on the thin side.<br />The cute design and the fact it will only be worn twice ...somewhat makes up for its shortcomings.",0
5,"Other than them shipping me the wrong item at first, these are exactly as expected. Great buy!",1
3,"Soft fabric and good length (slightly long) to wear over leggings (I'm 5' 4"" tall). Sleeves were a little long, which I like, but were not tight. The only problem is that the rest of the garment (front to back) was too small, and I ordered one, full size up. If I ordered two sizes up, the length would be really long, as would the sleeves. Just didn't work for me.",0
1,2 OF 3 BROKE/FELL APART TWO MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE. A WASTE OF MONEY!!!! 66% FAILURE RATE!!!!,0
5,Works great. Helps push fabric through when sewing.,1
4,The loop for the pendant gets caught or bends allowing the pendant to fall off,1
4,"I got these so I could use them as practice for HTV applications and they take the vinyl well.  I'm not a huge fan of the handles.  I would be nice if they were the same color as the bag and sturdier looking.  The handles feel pretty cheap.I'm going to market these bags to kids, so they won't have as much stuff to carry as we do.",1
3,The quality feels good for the price. Fairly sturdy overall. Unfortunately mine arrived with two dents in the top. These are hard to ‚Äúpull out‚Äù since there‚Äôs no access to the inside. I would give 5 stars if it came undamaged. It‚Äôs hard to reduce stars for a good product due to shipping damage but as a consumer I still received a damage product.,0
5,good deal for the price,1
5,I got a cup size bigger than normal as advised. Love this set.,1
1,"It was ill-fitting. The neckline  hung far too low, below the breastbone.",0
2,"The color is vibrant and the dress is cute. However, the material is 100% polyester, therefore, creates static, lots of static, and sound. I returned the dress.",0
3,I usually buy small. but got medium based on comments. But it turned out bigger than expected. sleeves falls loosely,0
5,BEST cap maker in the USA! Always consistent sizing and quality.,1
5,I like the overall fitting. The material is good quality. I definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a PJ with good-value.,1
5,"I bought this shirt to be part of my halloween costume this year, but I must say I was pretty impressed with the fit and quality of the blouse. Now it will be part of my regular work wardrobe, it fits very nicely.",1
4,"This is a  nice quality bag. Like all Loungefly products,it‚Äôs made very well. The embroidery is lovely. It‚Äôs a little larger than other tote purses I‚Äôve had. The price was cheaper than anywhere else. My only negative comment is that it has a very strong perfume smell. It smells like incense. I‚Äôve used it for a few weeks and I can still smell it. It doesn‚Äôt bother me but someone who is more sensitive to scents might have an issue.",1
4,"Very comfortable and cute, but order at least one size up. I wish I ordered two sizes up. I prefer my hoodies to be a bit more loose",1
5,I loved this dress. I received a lot of compliments in it.,1
4,"Very cool logo, received compliments, but was not expecting such a lightweight Tee for the price.",1
4,cute but too tight so I returned it,1
3,"It is good, seems a bit different than other bucket hats that I own.  I may get the orange one when I have enough money for another hat. Thanks.",0
2,I put these in my kids shoes for his first day at daycare. He came home wearing the stickers on his shirt.<br />They didn't stick...,0
2,Far from true to size. Brought a large which fit more like a small.,0
1,It rolled up when im just walking. And the high waist is too high,0
5,It works perfectly as you can see it's glowing in the pic,1

5,"I have been looking for a specific style for awhile and was nervous to shop online. But this sweater is perfect. It's so comfy and fits nicely. Not too loose. I'm about 5'2"" 140 lbs. It did have a weird smell when I opened it. I was worried about that after reading some reviews but I aired it out and it was good. I would definitely order again!",1
5,fits and came quickly!,1
5,Very nice and I'm glad I got it .,1
4,I love the colors of this dress. There ruffle top with spaghetti straps are great. Even the draw string waist. What isn‚Äôt so fun is that it‚Äôs not too forgiving if you‚Äôve had a big lunch.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 115lb bust 34C,1
5,"These HearTek Kids Earmuffs are great! I bought these for my autistic son and he really enjoys wearing them, as it blocks out a lot of noise that could be going on around him, whether the noise is from other children, music, television, etc. The description of this product was spot on. It does exactly what I was hoping that it would do, and for the price, it's outstanding. I actually looked at other local stores for earmuffs like this, but not the exact same brand, and they were asking for $50 or more. These earmuffs are definitely worth the cost. The earmuffs even came with a little drawstring bag that you can use for the earmuffs when they are not being used. To be fair, I will say that if you are looking for this type of earmuffs for a teenager or an adult, you should look for a larger size. These earmuffs fit my 7 year old perfectly. I will also say that I have tried the earmuffs on to see how comfortable they feel. As a grown adult, I will say that the ear pieces were really soft and cushiony. It did fit snuggly, but again, these are meant for kids and not adults. When I tested them I had a television on and there were 5 other people in the house. With them on, I actually managed to take a nap with them on!!! They really do well with blocking out noise. You still can hear a little, but not much. I would suggest that for any individual that has a special needs child, that is sensitive to loud noises, these earmuffs work great.<br />***Please note that I gave this review of the product of my own free will. I was not offered or promised anything in return for my feedback. I hope that my review has been helpful to those interested in this product!",1
5,I thought them for riding my motorcycle in the cold weather . Unfortunately they dont have enough grip on the pads .,1
5,This is the most comfortable soft sleep shirt I have ever owned!,1
3,"Ordered 3 units but only 1 worked.  One unit wouldn't output from the speaker terminals, another output crackled audio from speaker terminals.  One worked as expected for sound outputs, SD and USB readers and other described functions.<br />1 of 3 is a bad track record but the one that worked is a handy piece of hardware for projects that play mp3 files on power-up.",0
2,Very cheap quality,0
5,Beautiful ties. I receive lots of compliments when I wear them.,1
1,"Too small, must be a child's size.",0
5,Work great. Tight but not too tight. Long enough to cover hips,1
3,"These are warm, but the fingers are short and wide, so they are a bit unwieldy and are hard for me to use.  I will leave them in the car for emergency gloves.",0
1,Does not even look like photo. Collar is very small. It‚Äôs not as fluffy as seen in photo<br />2xl is more like a 3-4xl,0
3,"The shoes themselves are great. They clearly are good, quality made shoes that will last. However, I am unhappy with the packaging. I bought these as a gift for someone and the &#34;milk carton&#34; was very beat up as well as already opened, as if they had been returned. Will think twice before ordering as a gift again.",0
5,"I don't like to Travel with Big Pocketbooks all the time so this is great if you just have to run and go ...Very Durable..Waterproof, feels thin but perfectly made to hold everything inside !!! Phones,Keys, Pens, Ect.",1
1,Actual product does not resemble product picture. Picture shows a sweater-vest over a collared shirt and a newsboy cap. Actual product was a polyester vest over a collarless blouse with a poufy hat as in the attached photo. As you can see- very different in actuality versus what is being sold to you. I returned this product for refund.,0
2,Was iffy about the bow after I received it. It‚Äôs so cheap looking. The horn and stuff was glued on crooked. Then I noticed the purple flower was torn. Ordered a replacement dress and the purple flower was trash on that one as well! Both dress are being returned.,0
1,Not a compression top,0
5,"This is a nice top. I wore it the other day and got lots of compliments. I ordered grey, in xl, and it was very big.  I kept it anyway and wore it , it works well with leggings. I liked it so much I ordered a purple one.",1
5,Perfect for MY measurements (W 93 cm H 111 cm; height 5‚Äô6 weight 205 lbs) I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for people with a tummy and large bust as it is a little more form fitting in that area ^^;<br />The arm sleeves are nice! For once not tight on me~<br />Thigh highs have a nice stretch to them and I‚Äôm overall happy with my purchase!!,1
5,Love this jacket! Getting one for my other child now.,1
1,"It fit tight. When I saw it was made of 90% cotton, I tried to return it.",0
1,Cheap material was frayed at all sides and there were runs,0
1,This is the 2nd time I received a small but ordered a medium,0
2,way too small I usually take a size 6,0
5,Highly recommend.,1
1,Love the idea but the jewelry is changing colors (getting tarnished) already,0
5,Arrived exactly on time & was exactly what I wanted.,1
1,"I just received this and when I tried to turn on the fan, either the motor or the fan is broken. I tried hooking it up to a battery pack to see if the fan would work but it does not. Very disappointed.",0
5,They look great on my face,1
3,"I want to love these jeans, they fit perfectly...but, the color is a very odd blue and throws the look completely off! It‚Äôs disappointing.",0
5,&#34; Love the necklace!  It is beautiful and exactly what I expected.  I have also ordered the Sterling Silver Compass - can't wait to receive it! &#34;,1
2,"So the winding turn knob is comprised, has a chip. Much smaller than it looked in the photos. Looks like it will keep time and date but after reading the broken English owners manual, attention to detail isn‚Äôt a through line for OLEVS. Sending this back right away.",0
5,Fits fine. Will find out how well it works next time i cut my self while using.,1
5,"Really nice quality , itf was a present my son really likes It, thanks",1
1,Fits good at chest but tight for hips esp if in between sizes get a size up,0
1,Worst product ever!!!! Do not order waste of money doesn't work!!!!!,0
3,This product is not true to fit. The quality looks goods. It would be better if hat was Velcro adjustable.,0
3,It was too tight around my arms.,0
3,I guess I should‚Äôve looked at the measurements instead of the picture of the girl wearing it. She must be very skinny because this purse is small. It‚Äôs the same size as my fire stick remote. The coin purse I got to go with it is the same size. It‚Äôs cute just smaller than I wanted. The only reason I‚Äôm not sending it back is because it‚Äôs a gift and I don‚Äôt have to to return it and get something else.,0
1,"So, I bought the watch thinking it's cool. But it's really cheap. Trying to turn the bezel is difficult and requires a lot of strength. This is how the rubber strap gets torn.  The actual torque of you trying to turn the bezel rips the freakin strap.....before you get the cheap bezel to turn.<br /><br />Cut your losses and don't buy the strap....only to be in the same boat once you try to turn the bezel again.<br /><br />Even though this watch has a screw down case and screw down bezel......I guarantee mine will fail in the water because the crystal isn't properly secured....<br /><br />Lesson learned.",0
3,Break easily,0
3,"Very cute and easy to pull on and off of my 8YO‚Äôs feet. She didn‚Äôt feel like the footbed was very comfortable however, as it is very thin with little-to-no arch support. I added insoles and now she will wear them.",0
1,Wayyyyyyyyy to small. You better order three or four sizes larger,0
1,The tiny box that it came in was all scratched up. When you opened it the box was dirty on the inside. ü§¢ if I could give this 0 stars I would. Don‚Äôt buy it.,0
5,Love this swimsuit...if they had a variety of colors I would buy again.,1
3,"Nice sweater , but if anyone is planning on buying one just know none of the sweaters that you see with a black star are not black they are white stars on them .. I was a little disappointed when they arrived with white stars not black..",0
4,"a bit tight, but nice",1
1,After I washed this item in COLD water it shrunk so bad and I didn‚Äôt even put it in the dryer!! I would NEVER buy this brand again! I waisted my $$$$ I am so mad!!! üò° I can‚Äôt get my money back now! üò°üò°üò°,0
5,My husband wears Land End's t shirts a lot.  100% cotton is key for him.  The shirt wears well and doesn't get out of shape like a lot of t shirts.  This is a favorite and we shall continue purchasing Land's End t shirts.,1
3,The romper is very short in the legs. Almost no coverage. I‚Äôm not very tall so I can‚Äôt imagine how it would fit someone over 5‚Äô3‚Äù<br />I wish this came in a long pants version of this romper,0
5,"I needed to re-stock my supply of socks due to my previous collection being lost or worn out, and these stylish and modern style socks are the perfect replacement. The colors are brilliant and they match many suits, pair of slacks/chinos/jeans that I own. I haven't found any outfit that these socks don't go with. These are good quality, nice looking socks. I've paid three times as much for similar socks elsewhere. Definitely recommend. I will be ordering more in the coming weeks!",1
3,Now it's too short.,0
5,Love it! Perfect!,1
5,It took me a while to figure out how to see the image.  It stays close to the eye while looking toward bright light.  You can move it around to see the entire picture.  It‚Äôs so lovely.  I bought 4 as gifts.  All of them turned out wonderfully.,1
5,Excellent dress very pretty,1
1,Way too Big for a PONY! Don't waste  your Time nor your Money.... Misleading,0
3,"A little skinny for me, they're good sized and look good. They also feel good to wear but when I look in a mirror it's slightly out of my taste.",0
3,"This t-shirt fabric is soft but the graphic is printed on top of the fabric and is stiff. Also, it's a synthetic fabric and does not breathe well. So, not good for outdoor activities like hiking, beach, etc. The design and colors look good but the big problem is that the fit is off, like the pattern was off. The shoulder seams do not fall where they should, which should be where the shoulder ends and the arm begins. Instead, the shoulder seams are about two inches down on the side of the arms, making the fit uncomfortable and weird. It just doesn't sit right.",0
2,Order Xl and it didn‚Äôt fit need 2 size bigger I‚Äôm a 18 plus size but the outfit is pretty mad cause I ordered a xxl in another similar outfit and that was too big giving the dress to my daughter..,0
1,Missing button and fits very big!  Cannot use!,0
4,"great product,took awhile to get,but finally arrived.",1
5,"Shirt is very comfortNable and fits great. It is well made, not thin material! Would recommend.",1
5,awesome!!!,1
4,"Easy wear, beatiful but easy lost",1
2,"Runs small, tight across chest",0
4,"My wife love's these, easy to mix and match colors.",1
3,"Might be good for airsoft or something, but I wanted to use this in the army and it's more of a costume. The places that should be velcro aren't even velcro",0
3,I really wanted to wear one of them and it fell apart. So disappointed. Waste of money.,0
2,Super see through! Did not expect that from the other pictures and reviews. Maybe I got a dud I don‚Äôt know but not very happy with it,0
3,these are a lot thinner than I hoped they would be,0
5,"We love these socks. They fit perfectly, our shoe size is 6.",1
2,Not real 925 silver,0
2,The posture they advertise it shows longer length.  It‚Äôs way too short to wear alone<br />It is a crop top and not advertised that way!<br />So I‚Äôm restricted to wearing it under something . That limits me in Florida!,0
5,"I love this shirt, however I was cautious and ordered a size up it fit big so I ordered reg size & it fits great",1
5,Fits perfect.  Just enough stretch and the top is adjustable.  Definitely going to get more in other colors!,1
2,"The bracelet was too small for my wrist did not fit, but I like the look of it.",0
1,Dress is far smaller than size ordered 2x fit like it might have been a lg,0
5,"Great fabric, really soft and comfortable. Looks & fits perfect!",1
2,Did not fit properly in eyes....very uncomfortable due to it being metal,0
5,It's a beautiful bracelet. I bought it for my grandmother who cannot do traditional clasps due to arthritis so the magnetic clasp is a real bonus.,1
5,Love the different options to choose from,1
1,The band broke the first time I wore the watch. Waste of money.,0
2,Really cute outfit but shrunk two sizes on the first wash (when it was prewashed). Couldn't be worn.,0
1,Sizing was way off! Couldn't even get it over my chest.,0
5,great items thanks,1
1,Different than the one I had,0
3,also was made from a weird smelly material,0
3,Very thin fabric. Cute idea but wish the knit was thicker.,0
4,"The long strap on my 4 year old invicta Russian diver broke so I needed a new one. Original straps are 80 bucks! This one from a third party was much much cheaper. It was easy to install but the rubber band is flimsier and not as thick as the original. The metal rivets are similar but not the same as original. Hard to notice just glancing, but easy to tell if you look hard. It will work for now but it is clearly not as high quality as the original.",1
5,"Good product. My gf who is a HP addict, absolutely loved it.",1
5,"I'm  6 feet and 34a. I'm normally a medium in bottoms and a small in the top. I ordered a large just to be on the safe side and both the top and the bottoms fit perfectly. I have no hips but my butt is kind of big so it was pretty cheeky which I love. Surprisingly the top fit great even though it was a large. I definitely recommend ordering a size up from what you would normally buy for bottoms, because even if you think the top will be too big, you can always tie the bikini tighter and it will look fine. (p.s. sorry for the bad quality picture)",1
3,"I like it, but it already cracked on the side. I guess it goes to show you get what you pay for.",0
5,SENT TO GRAND DAUGHTER SHE SAID IT IS VERY SOFT AND IT FITS GREAT. SHE REALLY LIKES HOOODIES. SHE SAID SHE LIKED THE CONTRASTING WHITE ZIPPER AND THE THICK WHITE STRING TO TIE UP THE HOOD. IT DOES HAVE 2 SIDE POCKETS.,1
5,This watch does a excellent job on keeping time. It's not as fast as digital watch. At the stroke of midnight the calendar part is correct for that day.By 8:o'clock the next morning this watch is correct on the calender and what day it is. All in all a very good watch for a man to own as a dress watch. Mick,1
1,Small and cheap material,0
2,Should have ordered larger size.,0
3,The band is cute and the colors weren‚Äôt as bad as many of the other reviews‚Ä¶HOWEVER‚Ä¶ the size runs small. I ordered a large as I do with all solo bands. Most of my others large solo bands are getting a little big due to some weight loss but this large fits like a SMEDIUM and is cutting off circulation. Very disappointed,0
2,I wear 2x ... I ordered 5x and it almost doesn't fit,0
4,Se ajusta Perfecto bonito pero el material no es muy buena su calidad,1
5,Well made,1
3,Fits too tight. I was not pleased with the fit of this hat. It had a very snug and tight fit when I pulled it over my hair up I a bun. It did not stretch over my head too well.  I‚Äôm keeping it because I like the AKA screen print and I can wear it with my hair down.  Okay if you have a mall head and short hair.,0
1,Cheap and you can NOT SEE out of em,0
5,"Great socks. I have nylon, cotton and wool. Wool great for winter could be a little warmer. Nylon feel better in hot weather but I like the cotton the best. Wish they ran a bit smaller or had a smaller size range as I have small foot. Have most colors they also last forever.",1
5,To large,1
3,Well made but the color is orange not brown,0
1,Ripped ends of package,0
5,Even better than I had expected. Very high quality and I love all the pockets. The clip is very high quality which is great since its on my keychain.,1
1,NOT WOMEN SOCKS. MAYBE CHILDREN. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN,0
1,Criminals,0
5,"I wanted a nice piece to wear and this is beautiful. Bigger than I expected which I like, just a bit heavy, so not something I'll wear every day.",1
1,not happy with this hat. too oversized!,0
1,Work dress ever! I‚Äôm really surprised that the fabric is so thin. It‚Äôs super cheap looking. What‚Äôs worse is that the cuff on the sleeve does not stretch at all. It‚Äôs a thick material at the cuff and no adjustable buttons. It‚Äôs just a waste of material.,0
2,The ring is about the size of a nose ring if not smaller. The center ball doesn‚Äôt come out. Instead it bends in the middle like a clip on ring would. While it is very pretty it would be impossible to wear this as my bellybutton ring. It‚Äôs not at all what I thought I was ordering.,0
1,Excessive looseness,0
5,Wonderful fit. Lots of compliments!,1
3,"It doesn't fit like most men's medium tops. The elastic at the bottom of the shirt is awkwardly tighter then it should be. Too long as well I wouldn't buy unless you're over 5'8. Feels soft, light weight, thin, the hood is bigger then it needs to be. Thankfully this product is cheap.",0
3,My cellphone Galaxy 5 fits nicely. I was replacing one that the zipper broke on and I expected the same quality. The leather and strap are much cheaper quality than the original.,0
5,"I'm giving them a high rating because of the quality and the fact that they are truly beautiful especially for the price, but i had to give them away because the were small my daughter is a 11 and she has a thin foot and she could not fit these, they run very small a 12 would have been better but i couldn't send them back in time for the wedding. hope this helps",1
1,It might have been a nice watch if the correct instructions had been included. I could not figure out how to program it and the instructions included were for another watch entirely,0
2,"The numbers on the watch are easy to see and it could be cute, but that's all I see as positive details. I took one look at it and immediately setup the return. The dinosaur and the camo band are cute as a concept, but the band itself is super stiff and looked like it would be uncomfortable for any kid to wear. Even worse the face of the watch is so plasticy and it looked like it would break off in about two seconds of play. My son is rough and tough, and I just knew this watch wasn't going to hold up.",0
5,"I bought this to stretch out the inside of a straw hat I use while in the garden. Worked exactly like I‚Äôd hoped, and it‚Äôs made in the USA. Can‚Äôt beat it.",1
2,The Xl fitted like it was a medium. I saw that it wasn't made in the United States so the size measurements were way off.  Beautiful dress but the measurements were wrong.,0
1,"I was really excited to receive this product and attach it to my Samsung Gear S2 Classic. I did a lot of research, this had positive reviews, so I felt like I would be safe buying it. When I got the watchband, I tried to install it on my watch. Within seconds of opening the package, the little lever on the release pin busted off. Obviously, this isn't very well made. Also, on closer inspection, the band is a smidge to big. So, it never would have fit to begin with. I have purchased a similar band from another company, and it fit great! Exactly what I was expecting from this company but did not receive.",0
5,"This is much lighter and bigger than I expected!<br />It's made of that waterproof fabric you always see on backpacks and windbreakers. It is super light, this bag would be perfect for carry-on luggage as it doesn't add any additional weight.<br />Comes with handles that can velcro together and detachable shoulder straps so that's pretty useful!<br />What I like most is that the two side compartments are different. One side is a zippered side pocket, and the other side is actually expandable into the middle so it's easier to compartmentalize.<br /><br />This is perfect for traveling. Too big for me as a gym bag thought, it's huge! Maybe for a tall man it would work as a gym bag.",1
3,It looks ok but it's smaller than I'd hoped for.,0
1,I purchased an XL and it was tight and looked horrible despite the reviews claiming it was flattering on everyone. The top portion also did not fit well and gapped at the chest area. I ended up returning all four patterns that I purchased. My money was refunded with an amazon gift card credited to my account so now I have to figure out what to buy with it instead of just having the money refunded to my credit card.,0
5,This watch is just AWESOME not only does it look fantastic and super comfortable it's also packed with great features,1
2,They are nice socks but I got three of the same kind there were supposed to be two different pairs.,0
5,"Love the dress, fits well",1
5,Lovely necklace,1
5,Sides come up over the knee,1
2,The broke on me after 4 wears. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.,0
5,Ordered for a purse love it,1
2,Not as expected,0
2,"Cute dress but very see thru. I ordered the grey and white and will be sending it back. For size reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 275, 38JJ bust and I ordered the 3x.",0
5,"Beatiful, very good",1
5,Perfect for an extra layer of warmth,1
3,"They were the wrong size when they got here. I‚Äôm planning on continuing to stretch out my ears, so I‚Äôll definitely be wearing them at some point, because I really like them. It just sucks having to put them in a drawer till that point.",0
2,I fully expect these to fall apart (become unglued) with regular use.  They do not look very elegant or expensive in person.,0
5,GREAT PRODUCT<br />KEEPS PRESSURE OFF OF UNEVEN REAR PRESSURE,1
3,The frame is very big it does not fit any shape of face.,0
3,I have long thick curly hair and a big problem for me is matted hair when I wake up. I bought these to help prevent matting so I wouldnt have to braid my hair every night. It didnt help at all.  Great for keeping hair out of the way during activities though.,0
5,Hermosa y tal como se presenta en la foto,1
1,I had a really hard time getting this thing even on and once it was on it just uncomfortably smashed my boobs together and as i was doing my work out my boobs would still start to work their way out the top and it still wasnt comfortable jumping. Returning this bra.,0
5,Beautiful and well made.  The band is smooth and the stones and style are pretty.,1
5,LOVE !!!!!!,1
1,"do not look like the picture, huge, clunky & kitschy; more suitable to be on a christmas tree",0
3,"This may sound strange but I wish this bag was smaller (usually people complain about not enough space, right). I have all my swimming equipment in it (paddles, XL Speedo fins and pull buoy) and it fills only half of the bag. As the result of all the extra mesh everything gets tangled up and I have to ""wade"" through the bag to extract things. It would have been perfect at 1/2 or 2/3 of the size.",0
1,"Great ring until last week when it literallly fell apart on my hand. Looks like this ring is several parts glued together, and the glue didnt hold. None of the stones fell out, but one of the ends of the ring fell off. So if youre looking for a ring to wear occasionally that will fall apart as you wear it, this is def the ring for you!",0
5,Best deal on these I found. Amazing store and amazing quality. Yes these are authentic!!!,1
4,Good quality key chain; the swivel top makes it easy to add/remove keys. It's really stylish/cute and not flimsy. Will last a long time. I'm glad I bought it.,1
5,Love these. They are sturdy and durable.,1
3,"I really wanted to love this sweater because it looks super cute in the photos, but it was HUGE - like wearing a giant sack! Too bad because it was otherwise good quality and nice.",0
4,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 170, it‚Äôs a fitted fit, which I am ok with as I had not intended to layer with it.  It‚Äôs pretty short in the arms though.  If a tall were an option I would have gotten that. I do love the color though and won‚Äôt return.",1
5,Bought this as a gift.  Great bag!,1
1,Listen to reviews on this cheaply made and costly  product  is way too much.,0
5,Love this sign,1
5,"Love the color and fit. So glad it‚Äôs not fleece lined or too warm. And it has spacious pockets. But the downside of that is that it is a bit sheer and I could see the pockets lines.<br /><br />Overall, I would totally use it at home for lounging or at beach etc to cover up.",1
4,Very cool and elegant,1
1,The skirt is flimsy and cut too small,0
3,Looks well made. Loved it at first. Got little balls all over it first time in laundry.,0
3,"These masks are made well and are nice looking. Normally, I wash something once before wearing it. However, the fabric on these is so rough they needed to be washed 3 times for me to be able to wear them.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",0
1,Returning,0
5,"This is one of my favorite dresses for the summer time. Although it is a little shorter than the pictures shows even with the straps fully extended. More like a mid-calf length for my 5ft 7in. Regardless, I love this dress and would recommend it.",1
1,This item was nothing like I expected. My sister ordered one and it was stunning. I am going to see where hers came from and reorder. This was cheap and ran too small. The quality of the one my sister ordered was exceptional.,0
1,"Beautiful pin but arrived broken with the flower snapped off the stem.  All they did was hot glue the flower on, instead of welding it.<br />Returned it in hopes for a better replacement, and the second one came the same way.<br />Clasp also is very flimsy and loose.  Won't stay pinned to anything.<br />...  Get what you pay for.<br /><br />Also, neither of them were shipped with bubble wrap or any padding at all.  They just tossed the little things in a large envelope meant for something the size of an adult folded shirt or dress.",0
4,Cute.,1
4,Loved the look of this dress but the only prob was it was see through in the daylight so I had to wear a slip underneath. Other than that it is a classy yet sexy dress and I‚Äôll be wearing it to more events!,1
1,I wanted so badly for this to fit! It looked so cute in the picture. Unfortunately I have a rather large chest and it just wasn‚Äôt happening. I needed to return it.,0
3,I really liked it until the metal part broke. So unfortunately it can't be used anymore.,0
5,Love it,1
1,Can't really wear it if it stabs you in the neck whenever you look down.,0
1,"It only came with blue eyes where the picture shows it having multiple colors lights, straps broke the teeth cut up along face and it warped.",0
1,"Dislike, wouldn't recommend",0
1,The earring was not in the original package I received.,0
1,The design/fit is just awful.  Super loose and oversized in the wrong places.  Returned.,0
3,These look good but are not very supportive!,0
1,"I tried this on and immediatly took it off.  There is no support and its not easy to maneuver or tie in an effort to get it to stay in place.  On top of that, it hurts to take off.  For reference, I'm a 34D.",0
1,"I bought this tie for my father, but when I got it, it was half the size it said in the description. The description says it is about 60&#34; by 4&#34;, but I measured it and it was only about 30&#34; by 3&#34;. It was like they sent me the kids version of the tie. Also, the picture shows red, but it looks almost pink, and that won't do.",0
5,Ordered this has several times. Very handsome on my husband!,1
4,"Overall it's a good style just the length is way too long if you're 5'2"" even wearing high heels with it.",1
3,nice looking. Post is extremely short as for children. Silicone backing hard to grasp; slips out of fingers easily,0
2,"The size runs very small. I‚Äôm usually a medium, rarely large, but since I saw this tan small I ordered an XL. It is still too small for me. It‚Äôs tight !",0
1,"The only thing I like is that it looks cute just like the picture. I ordered a size bigger that I normally wear for this style top from what I read. I normally can wear an xl but went with the xxl and it fits like a medium. I'm disappointed because it's such a cute top, looks like it will be a present now for someone else",0
5,Good,1
1,"My new belt had a gorgeous buckle but belt was already cut too small for me.  I'm trying to replace just the belt but the only option I'm getting is a refund, which I don't want.  Just replacement of the belt.",0
4,"Great item for the price. If you scratch, break or lose a pair, just grab the next pair.",1
5,"What a classic!<br /><br />This watch ticks all the boxes. Function, check. Lightweight, check. Gorgeous, check.",1
2,I was surprised that I ordered the same size I've worn for a while and they are tight!,0
3,"Although this is a good idea, there are no colorful crystal rhinestones. The ring has a green color to all of the feather parts and I can't tell where the head is as there is no distinction at all.  Guess you truly do get what you pay for.  Will wear it during the week, but not for any weekend or dress affairs.",0
1,Way tooooo small,0
5,"Sturdy, durable, comfortable, looks high quality and expensive, beautiful‚Ä¶",1
1,Ripped,0
1,Too rough. Don't buy,0
5,"Bought this as a gift for my grandson who likes warm, colorful sweatshirts.  This really fits the bill!  It is a Christmas gift so haven't heard his reaction as yet but I'm sure that he will be very surprised and happy with this shirt.  It is soft and thick...a quality product.",1
3,"I really wish I could love this and the other pattern dresses I bought. They fit perfect and ideal for what I needed them for- but oh the material they are made of keeps you very hot and uncomfortable.  If you live in a hot area, even with it being sleeveless- it will be hot and uncomfortable .<br />Disappointed!",0
5,Love it ! Such a special gift üíù it‚Äôs so simple and So elegant.,1
1,"These were way over priced, they looked cheap and were of poor quality and i couldn't return then.. Sale was final. They didn't even come in a box, just a plastic bag.. My advice to anyone buying this is don't buy it.",0

5,Definitely works.. Help's you sweat more at the gym. Good quiality !!!,1
2,"This gown is nice but the material is just too thin. You can only wear it when you are alone or with your bf/hubby and also if you have a perfect body. Otherwise, everything is going to show, every little lining or crease.",0
1,"Cheaply made, do not buy. Reminds me of that cheap plastic toy jewelry you get as a kid",0
2,cheap quality.  Holes starting to develop,0
5,My son loves this belt.  Quality material and well made.,1
5,"Fantastic watch! Very intuitive to set up, great features for the price and feels well made. My 5 year old daughter loves it!",1
1,The worse sunglasses I ever bought they are cheap plastic and very bad quality I would not recomend this to anyone,0
5,Love it! Good material. Would buy again if needed.,1
3,"it is nice, but it look wired because it is yellow,no like gold",0
3,"I love the colors , very warm , I wasn't sure how high up on your legs, my calfs maybe larger.",0
5,Love this wrap. Gets nice and hot for my sore neck.. only issue was I had to find a power pack for it. Does not come with it,1
2,Not good at all. Gave them to someone else.,0
5,It's a fun tie to wear to silly events. The blue color is actually very nice and appealing in person. I have no regrets with this purchase :),1
1,do not order... this is a  very cheap piece of mess. Picture do not look like the finger ring at all.,0
4,It‚Äôs a nice dress for vacation,1
3,"Very clever idea- and so cute! You can match your hair tie to your outfit and put it in the bracelet to make it a fashion statement- so cute! I am not sure if it's because I have small wrists but if there is no hair tie on the bracelet, it does not stay on, it slides off my wrist through the opening. I've almost lost the bracelet several times. And the hair tie does not stay on 100%, it can be easily slid off if you rub against something.<br />Super cute and I love the idea but I kind of wish the bracelet were a little bendy so the opening could be made smaller. That way even if the hair tie slides off, the bracelet will still stay on.",0
5,Worked great for Lois and Clark costume.,1
5,Nice,1
3,I really like the material and how soft these pajamas are.  I have 2 pairs. The elastic waist band is a bit tight.  :-(  I wish there was just a draw string option,0
1,Liked the fabric but fit was terrible.  Too small all around. Sleeves were so small you couldn‚Äôt get your arm into dress,0
1,Received a used set....,0
5,This was for my husband who was diagnosed with Morton's neuroma. He said this was the most comfortable pair of shoes that he ever tried. He said something along the line of walking on clouds and asked whether we can find any other type of shoes from this maker. So we are purchasing ones for ourside use (since he kept wearing these slippers outside). Love the product!!,1
1,"Runs very small.  Material is very clingy.  Close fitting even though that's not portrayed in the photos.  Go up a couple of sizes if you want it to""hang"" on your body.  Color was very bold and ugly in person.",0
1,If you like sweaters that feel like you just put on a scuba suit this is for you. My fianc√©e just told me I look like a prisoner. I paid $6.64 and it‚Äôs was too much,0
5,"I previously bought a hat from Walker and Hawkes and found it perfect.  Excellent colour, fit and workmanship.<br /><br />I recently ordered another one,  which while reported as delivered, was never actually received (or was liberated from my porch).  I contacted the company and they immediately asked me if I wanted a refund or a replacement - without a raft of questions, photos, etc.  I received the replacement today, and it is perfect!<br /><br />I cannot recommend this company highly enough.",1
3,"This is a great dress but it's way to sheer for me & wearing a slip like panty hose is so 'back in the day' lol.<br />I ordered my usual size following suggestions of others but for my '5'1"" / broad 42"" back w/less small B up front / heavy bottomed45"" body' it was too loose. I'm sure it'd be great for as a cover up or hanging around but it's not worth $26.98 for that purpose.",0
5,Cane quickly & it‚Äôs super cute,1
2,"I was hoping the quality of these will be better than the dollar store‚Äôs ones, but no... so don‚Äôt waste your money on these, might as well just get it at the dollar store.",0
3,"I purchased these thinking that with the Thinsulate, that they would be very warm.  The look is nice, as well as the quality, however, in my opinion, they are mild weather/driving gloves.  They don't keep my hands warm in temps lower than 40 degrees.  Will be great if you need a nice looking glove.  If you need warmth, check out something else.",0
5,Perfect - not too tight and stayed on all night. Really soft!,1
1,The sword isn't bad but it arrived cracked in multiple places.  It didn't appear to be something that happened during shipping so I'm going to assume that it's a result of poor QA.,0
4,"First of all, it is a lovely dress, unless you have any bust at all. It seems well made, and the color is nice. However, as you can tell from the photo, not for anyone with a full bust! I wear a 40C, which I don‚Äôt think is ginormous, but I sure look ginormous in this! I would not wear this in public. It is a shame, because it is very cute. Maybe I was dreaming when I ordered it! I returned it, but wanted you ladies with a full bust to see what it looks like on. Very sad.",1
5,Love given to the men at my church for fathers day,1
5,I adore it. I'm wearing right now.,1
5,This bracelet is beautiful. This is my 3rd bangle from SPUNKYsoul and they have all been beautiful. I have received secveral compliments every time I‚Äôve worn it and the others I have from this brand.,1
3,3 stars because the came fast very upset the barbells we're really short I like the fact there flexible but the industrial barbells was totally short and the balls was the size of a 3mm so I was very disappointed I needed these for work,0
5,Loved these little dazzlers! They are very nice and added a nice little pop to my outfit for my event.<br /><br />Highly recommend!,1
5,Love these gloves!!,1
1,"Great dress but way too small, order 2-3 sizes larger",0
5,I purchased this bands for my daughter. She loves the design and it‚Äôs to attach to her watch‚Ä¶,1
5,"I am 6ft tall and 158 lb. and the fit is perfect. The fabric is soft and the quality exceeded my expectations. Loved it so much, I bought it in red for my girlfruend‚Äôs Lingerie shower‚Äîshe LOVED it too! Recommend!",1
5,I love these.,1
1,Bought this for my wife. Got her 3 colors and they all started falling apart from the bottom. Good looking boot but bad choice in materials.,0
1,The mask was upside down. I bought this for my son‚Äôs birthday and he can‚Äôt wear it. Soooo disappointed.,0
3,"Not a good shape for plus size or busty gals.  It fits high on the waist and has no shape from the bust down.  The stripes are black and the skirt is primarily navy, so the colors are kind of off to me.  If you're built like the model in the picture,  it'd be adorable though.",0
2,Way too small,0
1,"I was disappointed with this product.  The mittens were small, more like a teenager (middle school) fit.  No wear near as fluffy and full as the picture shows. Not worth the $15 I paid.",0
4,These frames are great!,1
1,"Wow! I didn‚Äôt really believe is was that small, but it is!!!!! Normally wear an x-small in every other shirt so I ordered a small, but I‚Äôm sending it back. Super soft.  It looks like it will snag very easily or get balls. Just noticed it has a hole too! The waist is tight.",0
3,They look rather cheap but costume jewelry is back in.,0
1,Did not properly fit the Swiss Walet I  purchased.,0
5,"My son loves these shoes, very easy to get on and aren't tight or blistering. VERY cute and look adorable and modern with any outfit, for a great price.",1
5,"I like them, beautiful rose gold color, length is perfect!",1
5,"I ended up giving this away because the fit wasn't quite right for me (it was a bit too small and didn't quite look flattering on me), but it was so pretty!  The white would be gorgeous for a casual wedding and the other colors would be pretty for something semi-formal.  Really great quality for the price!",1
1,Not for large chested ladies:( Wverything fits perfect but the triangle for the chest are SOOOO small. I had high hopes for this dress,0
5,Beautiful. I always get complements every time I wear them.,1
1,Product was shipped and then returned for damage. What a disappointment for a Christmas gift.,0
5,Would buy again.,1
2,"Item too small and does not fit as pictured.  Material cheap, it is thin and is not long in the sleeves or length .<br />Return policy doesn‚Äôt work, their number is not working.  All efforts to contact has resulted in zero response, I‚Äôve tried twice!<br />Don‚Äôt buy!!",0
5,This T-shirt is so cute and lovely for spring look. It came in handy to complete my spring look with my Initial on it. The cute floral design makes it perfect for the look I was going for. I also love the texture of the fabric. A girl can never go wrong with white tee in her closet!,1
3,I love it. I got a bigger size thinking it will shrink but it didn't so it's a little big on me. But I love them.,0
3,These shoes run at least a size or two big. My daughter was so excited to get these and super disappointed once she tried them on. Overall the shoes were cute but if you order definitely go down a size.,0
2,"Cheaply made and terribly sized. Nothing impressive with these. I even sized up to a large (I wear a medium in just about everything) and they still cut in at the sides and were too small. I would have done better going up from a medium to an XL. Only get these if you are super into muffin top...<br /><br />I was hoping these would be similar to my much beloved but discontinued Target (Exhilaration brand) underwear. Because they look super similar. They are not. The fit is terrible, the fabric is meh. Oh well.",0
3,OK I‚Äôm just about 6 foot 280 pounds I wear either a 2X or 3X and there‚Äôs no way in the planet this is a 3x. Definitely run small Damascus pretty cool but very cheaply made so I put a red T-shirt underneath and it seems to work.,0
2,They are not good if your on your feet alot. I have had them for not quite 3 months and they are already dead.,0
4,I really liked these so light weight so cute on the. ear great for yourself or gift giving to those teenage girls,1
3,the material is very thin,0
5,"This tie is gorgeous!!! My husband looks fantastic in this tie. Our whole family wore white, gray & gold for our Christmas church outfits. This tie added in the gold for my husband.",1
4,I like the quality of the boxers and the only reason they were somewhat large is because I ordered the wrong size. They do make great house shorts and I'm going to order them again in the right size.,1
5,"I LOVE tea length dresses, and this one is GORGEOUS!!! It's a retro style which I love! Definitely a dress that I will wear over and over!!!",1
2,"Don't stay on very well, slide down.  I followed the sizing guide however they seem too big.  Pockets are too deep and I NEVER say that!  Very soft fabric though.",0
4,"Cute sandals but like other reviews mention, the toe gets scuffed very easily. Other than that they're great for everyday wear and very comfortable.",1
2,Great bracket with beautiful colors and craftsmanship.  I only rated this low because the bracelet was small and I order the larger size.  After a few days of wearing the bracelet my wrist hurt and was red,0
1,The jacket it‚Äôs completely crooked the the braiding detail is slanted to the right. The button on the top left is higher then the one on the right,0
2,This jacket looks almost white in the picture but is grey. Don't order if you're looking for a white jacket,0
5,"Such great quality and extremely comfortable. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like about them is the length. They are a little too long for me, but I got complimented the whole night!",1
4,This was a gift for my mother. She is very happy with the quality and the style and  loves all of the compartments. She thinks I paid a lot more than I did. I just hope it holds up with time!,1
5,Nice and light but provides protection from the sun  without the child getting overheated.,1
3,"If you need a belt for appearance or color coordination this is fine, otherwise don't expect it to hold your pants up.",0
1,Flimsy material. Too small. Y about two sizes. Not worth returning.,0
5,It's cute my daughter loved it however it's a little small so might want to go up a size.,1
2,"I reaaaalllly wanted to love this dress, I love the design and I knew I should have listened to the reviews but I couldn't find another dress like it so I took a chance. Sad face. I'm a size 16 and I'm 5'5&#34; now thicker girls should know better when it comes to Asian sizing but cal said it would fit 14 to 16...now it did but was a little tighter than I liked and the worst part, it wasn't maxi! It went to my knees, even if I lost 50 pounds this would not be considered maxi. And it had what I think were supposed to be pockets....by the boob area might I add, who does that...but there is nothing in the world you could put in there to consider it a pocket, more like a brief opening. I'll probably return it, or see if someone I know looks killer in it, but please be cautious with this. 5 points to Gryffindor for nice material.",0
3,It is a return.  I love everything about the purse except for the strap.  It is not adjustable.  Bummer!,0
1,I regret buying it.,0
2,"It's a cute top but it didn't really fit like the picture.  I wanted something slouchy, but it fits like a normal shirt at the neck and is too small over the torso, so that part of my belly shoes.  It's pretty much what I expected from these types of sellers, though, and the price made it worth the gamble.",0
1,It broke within 5 minutes.  Very cheaply made.  I don't recommend.,0
5,"My 11 year old it tough on shoes, and these have held up great! Look good, wear well, and are comfortable. He has been using them again this year.",1
3,"It's a really cute cut. The main problems are that it runs 1-2 sizes smaller than American sizes, and the material is thin.",0
3,"Similar to the picture but not what I was expecting. Not very flattering at all and ran a little small. Comfy material. Shrank some during washing. Would work as a bathing suit cover-up, not necessarily &#34;going out&#34; material.",0
1,The dress is beautiful but really small I‚Äôm  order XL look like XS,0
2,Straps break easily...,0
3,The michael kors letters have fallen off,0
5,"I am very pleased with Travelambo. It hold all necessary documents, passport, credit cards, etc., and folds nice and compact without added bulk.",1
5,He loved it! Order big as they run small i ordered bigger because i read the reviews and it fit perfect!,1
5,Dressy while comfortable and breathable,1
5,I loved it so much I gifted it and they love it too.  Who wants a big wallet? It good if you don't have a lot of stuff in your wallet.,1
1,Buckle snapped off from the spot that it rotates to be reversed after wearing the belt for one day.,0
1,These were enormous and thin in a comical way.,0
2,Too small!!!!!!,0
2,Nice suit but I bought a 3xl and it's too small. I'm 5'4 and 220. Def foreign sizes. The bottoms fit. The top is about 2 sizes too small. I usually wear a XL or 14-16.,0
1,"Too expensive for the quality, although I assume the price was inflated because it was a week before Halloween.  The sticker was crooked too.",0
4,"Dress was very nice. Heavier in weight than expected. The jacket was to small. Expected lighter, looser, and more flowing type of dress.",1
5,I like these pants very much,1
5,"Usualmente mi talla es M, pero me qued√≥ muy ce√±ida y tuve que pedir una L. Sugiero pedir una talla por encima de la habitual. Es una blusa elegante y econ√≥mica.",1
2,"I think this could be a good product, but it has a little way to go on improving durability. I ordered two sets of these, one for each wheel. The first front wheel set stopped working and they sent me a new one (but that one seems to have never been delivered, which is a courier/Amazon issue). But right after they sent the replacement, the back wheel set stopped working too. Both were only a month or two old. From those two data points, these don't seem like they will last.",0
1,Material is not great.,0
2,"Loosely braided fabric looks like binding, looks cheap, has some beads on it.",0
4,"Very nice blouse.  One of my favorite.  White is not really white, more off white",1
5,I‚Äôve bought three pairs of these shoes and absolutely love them!  Super cute and super comfortable!!  Would recommend buying 1/2 size smaller. Thats what i did on the second pair and they are less ‚Äúfloppy‚Äù on my foot!,1
1,I was super excited to try out these leggings after so many good reviews. The fit and color were great but I did one squat to see if they were ‚Äúsquat proof‚Äù and the seam ripped. Super disappointing. Will be returning and trying a different brand that hopefully has better seam quality.,0
5,Love love love it!!!,1
1,"Within a month, both earrings no longer had the black stone in them.",0
5,"Cute boot, also warm and comfortable. I love this boot!",1
5,"12 year old daughter picked this set out, she loves it",1
5,Cute socks. There are threads on the inside that bothered me a little bit. But the materiel is good and soft.,1
5,great luggage. good size and sturdy. Wheels work great. I especially like that the set fits together (nests) to save space when not in use.,1
4,"Bag was nicely constructed, just didn't like that it felt very stiff and hard to get into. Had to return it due to that. Also it looked more squared than I thought it would be. Other than that, it was a very pretty bag.",1
1,"The black has all come off! This was a memorial to my 19 yr old step son that passed away, heartbroken it didn't hold up longer than a week",0
1,Cheap quality,0
3,"Pro: Looks just like the picture when on, from dead on. Very lightweight and the strap is adjustable - even fits my large head.<br />Cons: Smells like Old Navy when they get their shipment of cheap flip flops in from china. Let this one breathe before use 'cause it out-gasses big time. Obviously from profile or any other side angle no one is going to get what this is.<br />Like all of these new EL products, the power supply whines like a mosquito buzzing in your ear, so clipping it to the headband likely isn't an option unless you're deaf. It does have enough slack to run it down to your belt where it will not be heard over ambient sounds. Mine also ran the battery down while it was off, so you may want to disconnect it after your test until it is party time.",0
5,"Great skirt. Fit as expected and made well, I‚Äôll be getting other colors. Great piece for work!",1
5,Noce dress,1
2,It was too small and the fabric wasn't what I wanted. I ordered an extra large.,0
5,Soft & comfortable & tagless! Delivered fast. Highly recommend.,1
2,"They work ok, but most of the time the mask comes loose from the clasp.",0
2,I ordered my size but it's a little small.,0
3,"I ordered three pairs. At least one button has already popped off two pairs in only a few uses, which is unfortunate because these are great pants. The fit is just right. But they're useless with missing buttons. I'll probably see them back on, but I shouldn't have to do that so soon.",0
5,Great belt! Great hardware. Very good quality.,1
1,Not just a little small.  LIke 3 sizes too small.,0
3,It was lovely while it lasted. Broke within 2 months of normal wear,0
1,Ok so I thought it was a light blue Jean jacket but it just a baby blue jacket not a Jean jacket it‚Äôs light fabric I ordered a medium and the sleeves are short usually I am a small but I wanted it baggy it‚Äôs very wide maybe for a short heavy person. Completely disappointed.,0
3,if you have no butt or a big butt these are for you!! The way it‚Äôs rouched in the back totally emphasizes buttness which is awesome!! But.. if you are tall(I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù) it‚Äôs definitely higher than a crop and sits at an awkward place on the shins.<br /><br />I also wasn‚Äôt a fan of the quality/pattern of the fabric and rationalizing $30 for them. The leopard was different than the picture and the fabric was very costume like less workout type. One star loss for the length not being there and another for the expensive price-quality ratio.,0
5,"Love these bras. 38D and ordered the xl which fit great, altho not enough support to jog in. Perfect for lighter exercise and about town. The pads are a bit redundant for me üôÑ but easy to remove thru pre-sewn holes on inside.  Highly recommend.",1
5,"JUST PERFECT! IT CAME ON MARCH 29, BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME ON APRIL 4TH, SO IT'S AWESOME!  ALSO, GOOD MATERIAL AND GREAT FIT. STAY TRUE TO YOUR SIZE! BEAUTIFUL!",1
5,Just what I was looking for,1
4,Lots of loose string hanging off shirt but fits very well shorts are long a little past the knee,1
1,"I bought two of these. After 3 uses, both of them were broken. On one, the latch that holds the two sides together busted. On the other, the hinge lost its screw because the plastic broke off. Terribly disappointed with this product.",0
5,"This wig worked beautifully, I got many compliments on it. It being blue, of course everyone knew it was fake hair- but it still looked nice.",1
5,Nice denim dress,1
2,I didn't like the way this looked on me. It hung weirdly. I ended up donating it to a charity. Maybe someone else will like it.,0
5,Mr. Anderson what a surprise,1
4,"The reviews that it runs small are right, it does.  But also remember, the generous lacing in the back allows for as much expansion as you want. Order by measurements.  Good quality for the price.",1
3,"Love the Hoodie, size runs a bit small.",0
5,So cute and comfy. It‚Äôs something quick I can throw on to run errands or even dress up for a hot summer evening out.,1
3,The ring fits good but is much darker than the picture. The 13 and skull are not polished like in pictures,0
4,Headline says it all,1
5,"I actually use this item. Didn't think I would when I ordered it, I only did so for the fun of owning it. It really does work well at keeping all of my little things like a Magic Mouse, stylus, gum, smart key, cable, battery, in a great collected spot.",1
5,Love the fit and comfort,1
1,I want to return this item but don‚Äôt see an option to do so. I didn‚Äôt wash when I first wore and fit and length were perfect. After I washed on delicate setting with cold water and didn‚Äôt even put in the dryer and hung dry but the length shrunk! So disappointed.,0
3,Cute dress but wayyyyy too Polyester.,0
5,"This necklace is awesome!!! My teenage sister loves horses and it was purchased as part of her Christmas gift. As other reviews say the pendent is definitely larger than expected but that's a GREAT thing as most items end up being smaller than expected, making it an exceptional value for the price.<br /><br />The black necklace it's on is not grand by any means but it fits the personality of the necklace wonderfully (in my opinion).  The detail is great, as I wasn't expecting a lot for the price but was also pleasantly surprised with that aspect. She has been wearing it both times I've seen her since giving it to her and I'm almost ready to purchase one for me!",1
5,Nice product and very functional in packing.  Excellent purchase and Amazon delivery was prompt.,1
1,The pins that hold the bands in place fall right out. I already lost 2 of them just by taking the bands out of the package and they just arrived today.,0
1,Garbage ... Not accurate ... way off ... inconsistent,0
2,"The quality on this top seemed fine, but it was TINY. The size chart for it when I purchased it was grossly inaccurate.",0
3,"Earrings arrived with the posts bent over completely. The earrings were still usable after carefully bending them back. However, didn't lie flat to ear. Heavier than they look, but cute.",0
2,Really wanted to like this dress but it has no shape. Fits loose and almost makes you look frumpy. Looks nothing like what the model is wearing.,0
1,Poor quality and material,0
3,"A lot more Orange than I thought it would be, see through also. I‚Äôd recommend getting a slip to wear underneath",0
2,"If you are an adult, more than likely it wont fit on you. I have a relatively small face and it was too small. Fits my 10 year old sons face wonderfully.",0
1,The pair of slippers I received were damaged and used. It was unexpected to receive them in this condition because no where in the description it says they are used. These slippers were a gift so I immediately requested a refund and was hesitant to order antoher pair. But I did and the second one came new. The size was as expected but they are somewhat thin from the bottom.,0
5,So I noticed that the snap is a bit high like the actual strap is a bit high idk what do y'all think and I just got mine today.,1
5,It still fits great even if your name is not George!<br /><br />~Sasquatch,1
5,I bought these for my 11 year old Princess and she luvs them! They are very comfortable and with so many options a win win!!!,1
5,Very comfortable and great colors!,1
1,I ORDERED SILVER I DON'T WEAR GOLD,0
1,Low quality & ill fitting,0
3,"It's okay, I wouldn't buy another one or recomend to any friend o family member. It looks fake from miles away. The shine of the ring comes in the room before you do.",0
1,i bought 2 pair and payed more for the S/H than the earrings themselves. and when i received  them both pair were bent.,0
5,I haven't used these yet but they seem to be very well made. I'll do an update later if necessary.,1
2,Cheap material,0
1,This dress is very thin and does not look like the dress in the pitcure on the website. I really did not like this item,0
5,This is super cute but it runs small.,1
5,great seller great product,1
4,Wonderful fit for serious Grogu (Baby Yoda) /Mandalorian/Boba Fete fans. What‚Äôs not to love?!?,1
5,These are great water shoes. I bought the gender neutral color so my son could wear them after my daughter outgrew them. She wore them at her Girl Scouts camp trip and both kids love to put them on to wear around the yard. They‚Äôre very comfortable and easily fold up to travel with.,1
1,The chain broke the first time I put it on. It also has a strong smell of glue. Its a beautiful necklace but low quality.,0
5,I can‚Äôt think of anything that I don‚Äôt like.,1
3,They were not what I expected..,0
3,"I LOVE this band. It's beautiful and comfortable. However, after just under 2 months of daily wear, it is peeling apart. The edges are rolling up and taking the image with it. I will continue to use it until the images are completely gone, but I really wish it lasted longer than 6 weeks.",0
1,I thought the product would hold you in more but it does not. The zipper ripples. Not eye appealing.,0
4,"Wonderful Tee with the logo that the Sisters used for decades!  If you like Andrew and the lads' tunes, buy this to share that like with the world at large.",1
5,The best boxers I‚Äôve ever tried. They don‚Äôt ride up bad and are stretchy for legs. I have a small waist and very large legs. I have to cut most boxers/briefs for them to fit around my leg. But these fit and work great. And they don‚Äôt make you stink after a day of use like some other materials.,1
5,Lots of room for a ton of things! I am using it for swimming and all the gear that comes with it and I love it. Plus the color is rad too!,1
2,too small.,0
1,I gave these slippers as a gift and found out today that they the soles ripped.,0
4,"These pants are so fabulous! I got the green in a size large (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 160lbs, with a curvy bottom half). They are super flattering and great for work! The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because I haven‚Äôt washed them yet and some reviews said there were issues post-washing.",1
5,"This is a nice neutral jacket for fall weather. Not a winter coat however. The buttons are stitched well, its fairly lightweight and the loops on the sleeves are a nice touch.",1
5,My Grandson was very please with these. He liked he zipper.<br />I ordered the grey colour for him.,1
5,My daughter didn't care for the dropped sleeves bit the dress was pretty and otherwise comfortable.<br />Fits my tall petite framed daughter without it being tight. Goes a little below her knee,1
5,Helps me especially while sewing & while working. Keeps my glasses close meaning I don‚Äôt drop them or misplace them,1
2,The slippers are adorable but the bottoms were falling off after being worn maybe 2 times.,0
1,"I am trying to figure out how to RETURN this shoe. As with others who gave one star, same problem.  Sole broke after 3 weeks of wear and air cushion deflated.  This is TERRIBLE for a shoe this expensive.  First time I spent this kind of money on a shoe for my son.  Frustrated that I don't know how to get my money back. Do NOT buy these shoes.  Keep scrolling...",0
3,"Seemed like a nice belt if it would have fit. I bought the 34&#34;-36&#34; for my hubby who wears a 34&#34;-36&#34; in jeans, and it was WAY too small (like the very end of the belt barely touched the buckle. So I returned it and went up two sizes, and that one was WAY too big. We gave up.",0
1,Horrible. Don‚Äôt even fit in your ears. They are way too thick you can‚Äôt even fit them in your earring hole. Very cheaply made and some had crooked metal and looked like it was ready to break. Returned these right away. Don‚Äôt buy them if you have normal ear piercings. Won‚Äôt fit.,0
4,"Exaclty as imagined ... concerned the clock was already ticking though. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs been in a warehouse for a good while after production, so it makes me worry the battery will run out soon since it‚Äôs already been set ...",1
4,The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was only allowed to order one and I have two grand daughters. That was disappointing. But the product is just as nice as described and I know my grand daughter will love it.,1
1,they run small I order a medium my usual size and didn't even try it on looks small.  going back.,0
1,I wore it about 2 wks I of course took it off while doing dishes or showering but still tarnished.,0
5,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She won‚Äôt take it off unless I make her for family photos or something, lol. It came on time but held the shape it came in the package in for quite sometime. Now that it‚Äôs taken a more soft, natural, flexible shape, it‚Äôs much better and, according to my daughter, a ton more comfortable to wear.",1
1,They sent me to left shoes üò© and their super cute but useless I have to order again ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,0
2,Too large for a woman,0
3,The dress is beautiful; however the flowers fell off after the second wash,0
1,Great if it's dry and warm out . Uncomfortable to wear .,0
5,This bra fits just right. Good support that I‚Äôve worn running and training. I‚Äôm a 34c and medium fits perfectly,1
5,Exactly what I've been looking for fits good,1
5,When not using it pleasant to have a small cooler and hold a lot.<br />Stay cold for an excellent long time.<br />Three hundred forty miles and not anything defrosted!,1
5,I love this dress ...  great quality !!,1
5,Very comfy. Easy to maintain and put on.,1
4,I love the purse just wish there were a few more pockets. Also maybe a strap for over the shoulder.,1
5,"Excellent quality and customer service. Unfortunately, the brown leather didn‚Äôt match my bag and I had to return. They made it very easy. Would highly recommend this seller!",1
5,Looks and fits great love it.such a great price very well made.,1
1,Not licensed by Vuarnet.,0
3,Perfect fit between the middle of my shin to the middle of my thigh. Everywhere else is tight.<br /><br />They look nice. Feel durable. Gonna order more in a larger size.,0
5,Super cute!!!!,1
3,"I only purchased this because I don't have Prime and needed to spend a couple more dollars to get free shipping. That being said, I wasn't really expecting too much. It is cute and my style, but it broke at the jump ring the first time I tried taking it off. I have a bunch of jewelry making supplies handy, so I replaced the jump rings with the ""key chain"" style ones like in the attached picture. Now it hasn't broke, but I will update if it does. It can be a little difficult to tighten with one hand while it's on your wrist. I admit, I have to use my teeth, but my wrists are small and I need to tighten it all the way.<br /><br />All in all, I don't think it was a bad purchase since it was only $3 and I know how to fix jewelry. However if you're looking for a higher quality item or a gift, I would purchase something else.",0
4,"I saw these, thought they were cute. Packaging good, item arrived on time.<br /><br />The only thing I will say I didn't really care for, is that the color tone of the stainless steel is not as it seems in the online photos. The color is much darker, something that is not my preference.<br /><br />However, all else, meaning the size and design are as described.<br /><br />I would purchase from this seller again. However, if I am really interested in an item, I'd contact them to inquire about the color tone next time.",1
3,"These are much smaller than they appeared in the ad, but OK.",0
3,color and style,0
3,Okay. Description says there are &#34;matte&#34; but the frames are shiny. They are larger that traditional Ray Bans as well so keep that in mind. For $10 not bad... only slightly better than some $1 glasses.,0
5,Great comfy. Love them just what I wanted. I wanted a spring/summer pajama pant. This is perfect.,1
2,I tend to be sensitive to different metals but didn't have a problem with this product. It is also easy to put in.<br /><br />The not so good parts of this purchase: each nose stud comes out rather easily and the tiny 'gem' on the at least 50% of the nose studs was off center and unbearable.,0
3,IF you are getting a larger size you obvuiosly need more support and some extra spandex in the larger size would make the support sooo much better. They are fine but not great.,0
5,Very happy with the quality of this piece. The coloring and fit is as expected and the stitching is up to par.,1
2,While this is a very cute set the top runs VERY small.  I got a 2XL knowing that it likely ran a little small but didn't expect it to be this small.,0
2,They are quite thin and don't hold their shape well. There is also a small hole where it apparently came unsewn.,0
3,This keychain clip is cute but it is really small. I actually like the size except that the picture is a bit blurry.,0
1,"This arrived as just a strand of pearls with a bunch of thread tied in a knot on each end.  There was no clasp to connect each side, so this is not a pearl necklace, just a string of pearl beads.  I will now have to have my local jeweler put a clasp on it if I decide to spend more money on it, however the pearls are not that great, very dull looking, so I may end up just dumping it.",0
1,Not for grown up .. very small for school age children. Mask is to little for my 12 yr old. Material is thin like dry fit . Do not buy.,0
2,"Really big, not a fan",0
3,"I bought it at Sep, and now the tough scrren mode just show the time, you cannot change any thing on it because the screen is not working. I just used it for 5 months.üò≤",0
2,"Right shoe didn't light up and they had to be returned. Very disapppointing for my daughter who waited more than a month for their arrival. Return was easy, but still a disappointing gift.",0
4,great size and perfect for concerts,1
2,"I am thin, so my shirt coming out has always been a problem for whatever reason.  The clips worked for the front and back, but not the sides. Also, while at my desk, these showed while clipped to my socks a few times today. I can't have that.  Returned for garter style, with 3 clips on each side.  If I did more research I would have started with the other one.",0
3,"Ordered a size bigger based on reviews.  Bottoms fit just right, top was way too small.  I'm a size 6 with DD chest so I often have this problem.",0
5,Woodies are the olny sunglasses that touch my face so I had to put my wife on the team.,1
5,Very comfortable,1
1,very poor quality,0
2,"The hat looks much better on the model than on me. She much not have any hair because this hat shows every bump(braid, loc, etc). Will only wear to bed.",0
3,Fringes being white,0
3,Bought a few pairs of shorts. These were ok but others were better so I returned these.,0
3,"I was unhappy because when i received the 1st order 1 earring could not be used and a jeweler explained that it was crushed on one side, so it could not be opened..after complaining and said i would return the earrings, i did get a replacement pair...only to find that one of those earrings were damaged in the same way...so I now DO have a pair and I returned both damaged earrings, I am not completely happy with the quality of the earrings..thank you",0
1,Terrible material.. not pleased!,0
5,"This shirt is gorgeous!! It's lightweight so you can even wear it in warmer weather. It is so soft and comfortable to wear.  This shirt looks great with jeans and boots or a skirt and boots. The stitching is nice and tight, it's made quite well. I am so glad I decided to take a risk on this shirt, it exceeded my expectations. I would buy this shirt again without hesitation and if anything happens to this one I WILL buy it again!!<br />I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest review.",1
1,Do not buy this if you have long nails or wear press ons.  You cannot get it open with nails.,0
5,My baby love the hat . Paw patrol is his favorite!,1
1,Broke the first day.,0
1,"These started to come off as soon as I put them on. Maybe it's because I cut them into strips. Regardless, they just didn't work for me.",0
5,Very well made,1
3,"I ordered xxl, but it was too small.  I typically wear a 14-16 in dresses, xl in tops, 12-14 in pants. I‚Äôm very curvy and that‚Äôs mostly why the dress didn‚Äôt fit I wear about a 36G bra size and this dress is made for a much smaller chest even in the xxl size. The material is stretchy, so my arms fit fine, but having broader shoulders and a larger chest caused gapping in the armpit area, smashed my breasts, and empire waistband came across my breasts rather than under. The fabric is stretchy and has a slight shine to it like bathing suit/leotard material which I did not expect.",0
1,"Do not want to give it 1 star but have to in order to write this review. cheap, cheap, cheap Looking...NOT Sterling Silver - Returned It",0
2,Not what I expected the frame is a little smaller than I like,0
5,"I bought this swimsuit at Dillards  in 2018 and loved it, so I knew exactly how it was going to fit,  what I didn't expect was the number of complements I would receive,  I am over 50 so you want to look sexy but appropriate, I have had so many women ask me where I got it.<br /><br />Just an amazing suit.  BTY  I now have it in coral, black, lime green and a checkered pattern..",1
5,Excelente Calidad,1
1,very cheap looking,0
5,A mi hijo le encant√≥,1
1,"Measurements are not accurate.  Actual bag is approximately 10.5 inches high, 9 inches wide and depth is 3.25 inches.  I am guessing their measurements include the floral strap portion.  The two pockets do not hold even a standard water bottle.  I will be returning this.",0
1,Really disappointed in this dress it looks lovely and elegant on the picture but in reality it is very cheap looking the material is really clingy and shows up all lumps and bumps and it doesn't look nice on at all.,0
2,Disappointed the Christmas gift came with broken earrings. The necklace broke as well while waiting on the return info. Price is good but as expected not made in the USA.,0
5,I had to pin the sash to his shirt tho kept falling off,1
3,"Decent quality for what it is, kind of heavy around my wife's neck.",0
1,"If you like tight fitting shirts, these are for you, if you don't like tight shirts like me, past Lee is right on by, they're not worth the money spent.",0
5,"This is the first &#34;straw&#34; hat I've ever had that has fit me comfortably. Maybe my head is perfectly average, but it fits comfortably and stays on (even on breezy days)  without having to sew on a piece of elastic to keep it from flying away (as I've had to do with previous straw hats.<br /><br />It's not exactly &#34;straw&#34; but a synthetic straw-like weave that looks pretty realistic but is much more durable and resistant to wetness. The weave is tight so that no sun filters through and I like that the brim remains stiff and doesn't flop, thus providing coverage for face, and some back, shoulder, and neck.<br /><br />I love the bright blue color. It doesn't match any of my bathing suits, but still looks nice and makes it easy for my grandkids to spot me.",1
4,Nice but not as big as the one the model wears in the photo.,1
5,"These shirts are super comfortable and easy to wear.  I purchased for working out, but I find myself wearing them all the time.",1
3,The zipper part is kind of ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and the whole area right there is baggy looking almost. They fit great on the butt and legs though!! And the length is great with boots,0
5,Well made and comfortable,1
5,"Great fabric, not too heavy, but not light and cheesy either!  Just what I wanted and after a few washes will be my favorite bathroom item.  Thank you!",1
5,I got a large and it fit great exactly like the picture,1
5,"Soft material, fits my 7 yr old granddaughter perfectly and she loves it!",1
1,This is the REPLACEMENT necklace that has ALSO arrived with the 2 loops that connect the charm and the stone OPENED. Luckily these 2 were only opened about 1mm and I had my pliers handy to close them before losing them (unlike last time). They also neglected to add a return pkg with shipping label. EXPECTING ME TO PAY MORE MONEY JUST TO SEND BACK THE CRAP THEY KNEW WAS BROKEN IN THE FIRST PLACE.,0
5,Very pretty & different. I love them.,1
1,Im a 36 b but these are so uncomfortable,0
2,cheap plastic,0
5,"My daughter loved it, great value.",1
5,"Loved the coat.. Wrong color but I think it was my fault, but I LOVE IT!!",1
5,This is a perfect addition to our pool hats,1
2,I returned this charm holder.  Smaller & flimsy.<br />Will not hold several charms well.,0
4,"This seems to work well - adjustable to a wide range of sizes  The lock is quite big and bulky- that's my only concern. I'll be travelling overseas soon, hopefully this holds up!",1
5,"I've bought several different pairs of yoga pants and capris by different retailers and these are by far my favorite! Thick and high quality and the perfect fit (I got xs and am 5'0. They fit more like regular leggings for me rather than capris, but that's what I was hopinh got). Best value for the price by far, I would even say they are lulu lemon quality!",1
1,This clip does not clasp well; the fabric slips right out and leaves me fussing with the cape to keep it closed. A safety pin might be better suited than this clip.,0
1,"I bought this for my Granddaughter's 7th Birthday. She wears a size 7/8 dress. When<br /> she tried this 7/8 dress on it was extremely small. I had to repackage it, print out a return label and deliver it to an Amazon locked.  A big waste of time...If you're gonna buy these doll dresses order at least a size bigger than what child wears...for me just give me a refund... I don't have time to order, then send back and reorder, send back, reorder....",0
1,"Cheap material, the floral print looked poorly printed and the sizing is WAY off. I'm a small and it fit like a large. I'm returning",0
3,"I ordered mine through a site on Facebook. Got the bracelets today, ordered two of them. Their tricky to open and they won't fit a adult medium wrist. They are pretty, but poorly made.",0
5,"Literally, almost everyone I came in contact with complimented this dress. The skirt is quality, very thick.",1
3,Didn't like the plastic crystal,0
3,I hate the way these hang. They do not hang from your ears the way the picture shows. They don‚Äôt look anything like the pictures when you put them on. I‚Äôm very disappointed,0
3,"Cardboard soles with flimsy foam insoles over them.<br /><br />Let that sink in. These boots would be good for cosplaying or light wear around the office or outside, but I wore them on a four day larp and DESTROYED them. The insoles and soles disintegrated. They have no padding or support other than a flimsy piece of foam over literal cardboard, it's so thin you'll feel every pebble on the sidewalk. I'm going to be making my own replacement soles but I would recommend against getting these if you don't want to have to do a lot of work to keep them wearable.<br /><br />On the upside, they look really nice and are comfortable if you only wear them inside or around a city. I've received a lot of complements about them, and do plan on keeping them, even with their myriad issues.",0
1,"Waste of money, broke within days. The ball came off the post of the earring",0
1,Purchased this product a month ago and the straps broke already..<br />I really liked the bag<br />Upset that it‚Äôs brojen already,0
1,Havn't even had the bracelet for two months and it already turned it tarnished I had to get rid of it... soo disappointed,0
5,"Dress came in pretty quickly. Looks gorgeous! I am 5'7 125-130lbs with a C cup so I ordered a size 6, like the measurements suggested and it seems to fit pretty well! I may have the straps tightened a tad but with heels I think the length is perfect! (Don't mind my daughter in the pic she was in love with the dress too!)",1
5,Was purchased for my 13 year olds winter formal... She loved it,1
1,The fit & style were nice. The frame appears to be painted gold & Very tacky looking. Glasses from the dollar store look much better than these. Ordered these because the picture was pretty....,0
5,Lovely,1
4,"This is a quality shirt, and I bought two (green and navy) to use as PJ tops with Eddie Bauer flannel bottoms. Because it's designed as a cold-weather layer, it is a bit snug. I like it that way; your mileage my vary. My only nit: the colors are darker than shown in the photos, so I subtracted one star. Sure, a non-optimal color match with PJ bottoms is not a crisis, but, hey...",1
4,"Great, comfy dress!",1
5,My daughter received this t-shirt along with a Mulan doll. Loves them both.,1
5,not bad for the money! thanks!,1
3,You can probably get something better locally for the same price.,0
2,"Can't wear accept for rolled up sleeves, button placement is terrible, and itchy feeling. Good color and design but still crap for a hefty price don't buy.",0
2,"Got this for my mother, she said it's way too short in the back, otherwise it's a fine fit.",0
1,Roto,0
5,My grandson loves it!,1
1,You get what you pay for .they are not the best quality.very thin way to small.they were paper thin.couldn't send them back.they agreed to send. Me something to replace the item that never happened.,0
5,"I love love love this jacket. I was concerned about size so I bought a size up (large) and it would have fit better my normal size (medium) but I still enjoy the fit. It‚Äôs very warm, and although it‚Äôs not proper waterproof fabric, I live in WA and it still protects me. The only problem is the zipper is very weak, broke off about a month after I received it. Still recommend.",1
2,Too Small!!!,0
5,"This dress is so pretty! And the material on the top is so super soft! Wow, what a great buy!!!!",1
2,Expected high waisted. Falls short on the backside which makes it roll down when bending over or squatting. Material is high quality and pattern is very pretty. Fit just didn't fit my body. Going back,0
2,"A fair novelty gift, but mine stretched out of shape in a couple weeks. At least my toes get exercise trying to keep them on. I guess they are made to be seen in rather than to walk around in.",0
1,It looks better in the picture then in real life.  The fabric was stretchy and the colors were faded.  I washed it once after trying it on and my goodness when that dress was finished washing  talk about a faded fabric...I never got to wear this dress because it was to cheap for anyone to wear so it went right in the TRASH!!!  Do not buy this to wear...I hated it!!!,0
1,"Carbon Fiber super thin/low quality... Right pole broke right at the ""locking Point"", the 3rd time i used poles. (Mud baskets both broke the 2nd time i used poles)... This would have been a serious problem if i was relying on these poles on a very long hike... Once broken, the poles are just trash you have to carry until you get to a trash can (or all the way home if you want a REFUND) ... DON'T BUY THESE.",0
4,Nice quality.  Good price.  Just a bit big for my liking but worked for gifts for my customers.,1
1,-30 degrees my ass. These gloves left my hands ice cold on my hunt. Glad I brought a backup pair with me.,0
4,"I love the earrings, but they are a little smaller than I thought.  Would still recommend them, looks good on.",1
3,Ok product. Length is smaller than as shown in thepictures.,0
5,Gave to my daughter as a gift and she loves it.,1
5,Absolutely Love this Combo. My husband looks amazing in it. This is the only metal he's not allergic too!!,1
5,To sleep in,1
5,The rose gold pink shade is gorgeous.,1
5,Qued√≥ s√∫per grande para la talla pero s√∫per buena calidad.,1
5,"Quality is good. Ordered XL per their size chart, but it was too big.  M is too small.  Ended up with L, a bit loose but okay!",1
3,Ok Product,0
4,Not enough hooks for all keys,1
5,My daughter had been asking for stitch shirts and came across these. First I ordered a size 10 the size she usually wears in any other brand but they were too tight I exchanged for a size 12 and they fit perfect. The material does not stretch I recommend sizing up. My daughter loves her stitch shirts I would definitely purchase again. Great price for 3pk,1
5,"Great boot. Was a little tight on my big toe, but after wearing them around they broke in fine",1
1,Usually these come w a metal piece sewed to the end for easy set up. This didnt have that and the fabric was so thick on one side I had to cut it a bit so it would fit into the watch. The ones w metal on the ends were the same price as this one so next time I'm just getting those and not this.. it took 30 mins and I had my husband hold it while I use a spoon to help me push the pin in .  Pain in the a**!,0
5,"They look really cute, the loops were broken during the first week of use, but I just clipped them off and my daughter loves wearing them. Perfect for Spring and all the rain.",1
5,I always wear compressive socks in flight. Will keep your feet from freezing on intercontinental hauls.<br /><br />These are plenty comfortable. Sizing is important so make sure of your size. Fits as advertised.,1
5,I typically wear between a 20W-22W short length pant depending on the style/fit. These fit comfortably and I've enjoyed lounging in them! Highly recommended!,1
3,They are just as described but run super big. I will be keeping the larger size because my son's feet grow eventually,0
5,"great job, thanks",1
5,"Great gift idea, good quality, runs a little on the small side.",1
1,Arrived broken and are returning.,0
5,Super comfy - and the pockets are awesome!!,1
5,Happy ... so cute,1
5,I like the kit for changing the link size of this product as it was easy to understand and to use.,1
2,"You can't actually see out of these glasses, ergo my return",0
1,Supposed to be new and it was covered in white dog or cat hair.,0
4,for the price it will work well,1
1,The product did not meet my expectations at all. It was not made the way the site presented it and I will not order from this site again. I never wore the outfit.,0
4,Fits as expected for my usual size 5-6. Lace does not itch and it does not ride up. Just enough coverage to not look like granny panties.,1
1,Didn‚Äôt like them at all. The handles were on the opposite sides. Waste of money,0
5,"Cute t-shirt, great quality, runs a little big",1
5,"I've purchased gear from North Face, Spyder, Patagonia, and more. Every time I buy Helly-Hansen gear I like it even more. It's fits my frame well, has the right length to the shirt tail to not be too long and not too short. I like this material and feel it makes a good base layer, as well as a layer under a vest as well. I will most likely purchase another of these in another color.",1
5,This hat is a bit small but perfect for a small head.,1
2,You get what you pay for. It‚Äôs looks cheap. Lol<br />But it will do the job. Not something I would like to recommend or repurchase. The picture is a good lure.  Costume jewelry look!,0
5,Beautiful,1
1,"I'm 5'4 and 119 lbs. I went up to a medium as suggested and it cuts me in two. I think I would have to get an XL before it fit correctly. It's also very sheer, so keep that in mind if you're wearing this somewhere that the lighting is more than dim.",0
1,you get what you pay for! grips peeled off within a couple days of wear. they aren‚Äôt warm.,0
5,"This dress is amazing! And for the price, you really can't beat it. It's comfortable, yet form fitting and classy. I'm 5'5, 120 lbs and the small fit me perfectly.",1
5,"LOVE these! I only use one, so I have a backup in case I lose one! I get compliments on it all the time!",1
3,Good for larger head.,0
1,Very Cute shirt but not true to size at all,0
4,"For the most part came in excellent condition, few keys had scratches and none were secured in box.",1
1,"Very odd and unflattering fit...large in the shoulders, tight in the hips, sewn weird under the arms so that its baggy but I still feel like I can't move my arms..?  I ordered a size large, though I'm usually a small or medium, based on the reviews and feel if I ordered any smaller it would have been too small to wear at all.  Fabric is very cheap and has no give or breathability...might look okay with a cardigan and tucked in, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.",0
5,Got lots of compliments on this dress! Good purchase!,1
5,Nice looking belt with great quality,1
1,I did hot power yoga in these and found them sliding down and I had to keep pulling them up. They are fine if you‚Äôre not exercising in them. I wouldn‚Äôt purchase these gain.,0
5,"Bought a pair for my daughter and a pair for myself and we just love them! Very robust, authentic feel to them, and while I expected at least a small reference to them in SOLO, it was cool to see them so prominently featured in the film just a day after we received ours in the mail!",1
5,They're gorgeous,1
3,"It was for a present , but size 14 P too small !!<br />The jacket is beautiful!",0
1,Not only did I order a 7 to 9 year old dress that wouldn't fit a four year old it looks nothing like the picture. It wouldn't not unzip all the way (zipper was stuck). This dress overall did not please me at all. Don't expect to get what's in the picture or you will be disappointed.,0
1,Wasn't the material I was expecting.,0
5,Cloth works great on silver.,1
5,Love the dress and it's fit!,1
3,"It's very cheap, but I only paid a few dollars and no shipping so it's what I expected. Its very cute and looks like the picture. The clamp on the back hurts after awhile so I can only wear it for a few hours. The clamp is adjustable but I'm afraid it will break if you arent careful. I ordered it in silver but I got gold, not a huge deal. It arrived a week and a half early!",0
4,"My son is a skinny 7y/o who wears size 6-7 and that was exactly the size I ordered, gotta say that these tank tops are longer and thinner than expected.<br /><br />They are comfy and lightweight but I'd expect something a bit better and durable for the price.",1

3,poor quality and not as cute,0
5,I love this shirt. It is quite slimming and very comfortable. It is true to size. Would buy another one.,1
2,"The dress is beautiful and the seller was wonderful and custom fit my dress. The color isn't what it looks like on line. More yellow tone I guess. Totally wipes my coloring out and the top part feels very scratchy. This will make my outdoor wedding uncomfortable and the color won't do for my wedding. I really wanted this to work, but due to time constraints I just am using a summer dress that I found at my local department store.",0
4,"Color wasn't Burgundy as the description was, but still a great purse.",1
1,Terrible!! Started ripping on its first wear. It looks cute but doesn‚Äôt last. At all.,0
3,"These are very cute, but an 8 is very small and narrow.  The shoes are really heavy and I felt really clumpy in these so I returned them.",0
4,"its a good hat, just a little small",1
5,Gift for my grandson to carry a lot of camera equipment.  He loves it.,1
2,Not as I expected. . It was leather but it was not the type of leather that I wanted. Service was slow,0
1,"This was the second clip I purchased and, like the first one, I lost it when it fell off my shawl.  They both fell off within two days of wearing them.  They are quite nice but they don't stay on.  Nice concept but it didn't deliver.",0

5,my favorite futurama character,1
4,"I do like the product. It helps with identifying my luggage quickly.  However,  now that my luggage has been damaged,  I can't get it off to put it on my new luggage.",1
5,Super cute!!! I wore it one time and got lots of compliments! It was a last minute costume for me but it would look even better with skeleton make up! Will wear again!,1
3,I went by the measurements that were provided and decided to get a medium thinking I would have a little room but it was way too small. Go up a size if you want it to fit right.,0
5,Went snow tubing with the kids in CO and it did the job.,1
5,Bought for my daughter.  She loved it. Thanks,1
5,Love this hat and love the color.,1
5,Excellent quality. The pendant was larger than expected but every bit as beautiful. Quick delivery!,1
1,Beautiful dress but I ordered up 2 sizes and that didn‚Äôt work. What type of guide are they using. I wear a 16 all day everyday so I ordered a 2X.,0
2,Nice but very small,0
5,"Small  and cute ,.can wear  with  üëñ. Pants , skirt, or üëó  .!@@",1
2,I couldn't use it for my purposes. I attached this to the zipper on my wallet and would hold elephant to open close zipper. But the chain is not sturdy and came apart within a few days of use. The figure is also pretty small (about the size of one of my fingernails).,0
5,They fit,1
1,"This product fur lining smells like fish, could not get it out ‚Ä¶",0
5,"These are great, helps block the blue light when my son plays video games. And has reduced him getting headaches.",1
1,Too small. Says it is for a toddler but wouldn't be large enough for a 2 year old! Super cute good quality but very misleading size.,0
5,Comes in a decorative box with a clear boc inside for viewing. This is my mother's favorite color of rose and the only one I could find.  Very pleased with the quality.,1
5,I have gotten several compliments on this purse. It is beautiful yet durable.  I believe it looks better in person than on the computer screen.  I have no complaints.,1
5,"Cute, good quality!",1
3,its ok,0
1,"The cushion on the sandal is soft & plushy and would be a comfortable shoe, however, the thong part and strap around the ankle is entirely too wide. This shoe appears to be made for someone looking for a cute and comfortable sandal, but with very thick ankles and feet. Definitely returning!<br />Beautiful design, but not made for people with average feet. Perfect for fat (excuse the term) feet.",0
5,Nice socks. They are thin and comfortable.,1
2,Bought this for myself used it twice and the straps came off. Very disappointed I loved the purse. It was perfect size and loved that it had a zippered area inside.,0
5,"Perfect for a predator costume. Made a huge positive difference when modifying our costume with it. So many compliments, pictures, and costume contests won. Highly recommend! I did wear shorts and a upper body suit to amplify some body aspects. fit my wife perfectly.",1
1,"This is your typical Chinese product . . . completely void of any quality.<br />If it were described as a T-shirt, that would be more accurate . . . sort of.<br />Completely disappointed that you can't find any other sources for these shirts / pullovers / hoodies / ""sweatshirts"".<br />I would add a photo.  But, there's no way to show how thin the fabric is.  And, I've invested enough time, already.<br />Should you decide to purchase, the sizes do run small.  Order 'up' one size, at least.",0
5,This is beautiful. It‚Äôs true to size but a bit snug around the buttons.,1
1,Clips do not fit on windows. Waste of time. Very disappointed.,0
3,"I give it 3 stars for the shirt I still use it really good quality, simple shirt but the pants and the hair band on the other side is the worst quality I have ever buy.",0
2,Just an overall weird fit. Plus the diagonal stitching didn‚Äôt look right.,0
2,"So let's start with I have always been spoiled by VS bra's....like always! I am a 36DD or a 38D so finding bras with actual padding is a pain. This one is no different. This is a lightly padded bra and that is it. There is enough padding to have a smooth look to your breast but nothing more. Not to mention there is no way this is an actual 38. The bra came with an extender which was most needed as the bra alone seemed like a 34. I tried to wear the bra without the extender on the last hook and it was super tight and made me have those awful rolls that no one likes. I added the extender and it was okay. I did not bother to try it for a day as I could tell I was not going to like it. (plus one of the cups already had a fold in it, no thanks)<br /><br />If you like a bra with better support and padding look somewhere else.",0
5,Nice look so pretty,1
5,Arrived really fast and super cute. Haven‚Äôt worn them yet but can‚Äôt wait.  Very pretty yellow color. Just like the pics,1
5,Love these socks !,1
1,Received this and it is about several sizes too small,0
1,Thin non-structured,0
2,Poorer quality than I was expecting.  Would not buy again.,0
3,"I got 2 hats, both size large for my 2yo and 5yo girls. 2 yo got blue, 5yo got pink. The pink is smaller than the blue and it‚Äôs too tight for my 5 yo. The blue fits her okay, but I‚Äôd prefer it a little looser for growing room. Of course, they won‚Äôt trade. I‚Äôll be returning the pink and finding an adult hat- hopefully it‚Äôs not too big.<br /><br />Otherwise, they‚Äôre good hats! I like the drawstring to adjust size (if it‚Äôs too big üòë) and the cap fits nicely and covers well in the sun. Perfect to keep extra protection in our hawaii sun!",0
2,"The color was washed out, it's very thin material and the size was off. I would go up one more size.",0
4,"I ordered clip Not pierce; Although they are beautiful, I am stuck will earrings that I cannot use.",1
1,This was low in cost. And that is what you get in your purchase. It was thin. Not made well and the Velcro was sewn on the wrong side. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it!,0
1,"This bag is not giant in the least.....On the contrary, it's super tiny.  There isn't even a bottom to the bag; instead, the front and back are sewn together...making it even smaller.",0
5,Writing is very small but it's a nice gift,1
5,Warm,1
1,"[[VIDEOID:a8800c1576b021e595bd760ed8a56d5b]] I bought the item under the impression that it was pure gold, it said so on the invoice, but when I went back to see what it said on Amazon it says gold filled, also the catalog it comes with states that it is gold over resin. They began to show problems last week and when I went to take them to my jeweler they explained to me they cannot fix the wobbly hinge on the earring because it was gold filled and not actually gold. I payed 135$ for these earrings, I feel that's a lot of money to pay for something to break so easily.",0
1,I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù tall and weigh 150 pounds so I thought the socks would fit. I know they are supposed to fit snugly but they were so tight they cut off circulation behind my knees and caused pain. I even broke a nail and threw my back out trying to put them on. I returned them for a refund. I can‚Äôt recommend these socks.,0
1,The cross as other reviewers have stated comes in two peaces. the outer cross is flexible and came off and was lost the first day I wore it. Put in a little more money to get a quality product. Shipping was also very slow.,0
5,Beautiful but mine arrived missing one piece so I had to return them,1
2,"Compression not up to par.  The band at the top (like many compression socks) cuts more than it needs to.  Cannot make it thru a day without having to release the tourniquet caused by the extremely tight top band.......and have decided to go ahead and trash them.  They are also on the 'thin' side with respect to the feel at the foot (more play exists with normal shoes and you'll notice it).  Ultimately, the brand/product that I've found making the best 20-30mm compression socks today is SB-SOX.  Unfortunately, DVT's developed in the one leg during a surgery and I now have to wear this type of sock (with the 20-30mm rating) every day (not pleasant but the alternatives seemed worse).  After a dozen or so different brands/flavors (including the type your doctor gives you an Rx for - and that cost $60 (a waste of money for the Rx in my opinion)), I've only found two brands of the 20-30mm compression socks that are suitable for every day use that won't break the bank (SB-Sox as noted above and the other one was Run-4-Ever.........with discounts for multi-pairs, the SB's ended up being the product I go to the most).  Anyway, best of luck to others out there that have to wear them.  Thank you.",0
3,"I found these very unpleasant to handle, and a little larger than expected. They do function well though.",0
3,ok,0
5,Love these need to order more,1
5,excelente,1
2,They started to tear in less than a month,0
2,The dress was cheaply made. Didn't exactly  match the picture posted. Very snug around the arms and bust. I am a size 18 and the largest size fit but not well. It was flimsy. It does have some stretch.,0
4,"Packaging was horrible, clothes were stuffed in some kind of zip lock bag and the bag was open so the clothes were basically half way out of the bag just sitting in the box that also had make up that I ordered. Thank god nothing opened and spilled onto it. Otherwise great quality for the price. Ordering a bigger size though.",1
4,"My aunt got these for me as a Christmas gift. :) They're just as good as the designer boot covers They aren't really soft,wish they were. They get real dirty if you walk outside, so they need to be well-kept and brushed a little so they don't get ratty.",1
4,"I ordered the 00g size, and I would say these are somewhere between a 0g & a 00g. Slightly too small for my ears, but beautiful nonetheless. Great deal for the $$",1
4,This bag fits my laptop well. I appreciate the variety of storage compartments and that the top zips closed. My biggest complaint is that it falls/leans which is creasing the fabric and further exacerbating the issue.,1
5,This is my wife's cozy time sweater top. She loves it!,1
5,"Not silk! Don't be fooled by the name, instead a stiff fabric",1
3,"I have mixed geelings about this product and company. I loved this bag when I first got it. I bought it for my laptop & books for school. It was great, it seemed pretty sturdy then I  was walking into school when my strap caught on the door causing the strap to break at the stitching.  I had it for less than two months. I was a week over the 30 day return policy and the company told me there was absolutely nothing they can do. Even after I said I still love the bag. I just wanted to exchange it for one that wouldn't break in less than 2 months.",0
2,Nice glasses but they came with only one rubber support for my nouse,0
5,"Material is very thin but that‚Äôs good because I live in the south. This set is very sexy, your cheeks will hang out of the bottom if you are bottom heavy but I think they were made for that if you know what I mean üôÉ",1
5,Great quality!,1
1,Poor quality,0
5,Wife loves then,1
2,"Need to know the inside dimensions. Not the outside. Everyone is putting the outside. Looking for the inside dimensions to be no less than 6 inches length, but thing to fit in a dress shirt pocket.",0
5,So I ordered the smallest size and the largest. Love them both. I'm a size small in women's. And the 12-14 fit me perfect. The size five is so baggy on my 3t wearing child but she wears it as a sweater dress kinda. Super warm and soft and cozy. There is loose threads that need trimmed here and there which sucks but you get what you pay for I'm not mad about it.,1
1,Nada me agrado muy mal servicio pq yo pedi algo y me mandaron lo que no era ni el size estaba bien,0
1,"This arrived & I was immediately disappointed - the logo & lettering are quite faded, not at all vivid as shown. I also received the incorrect size - I had ordered a 3X, assuming they ran small, and received a 2X that fits like a 1X - seems like this may be young adult sizing? Definitely do not pay $26 for this product, unless you want some faded Gryffindor leggings, though who's to say you'll receive the size you ordered anyway.",0
5,"Excellent suit for those who are no longer a &#34;hard body&#34;. As a former micro bikini wearer, this suit covers my aging flaws and yet manages to still look sexy and sophisticated. I love it and have gotten lots of compliments while wearing",1
5,"Liked the style.  We‚Äôre larger than I usually wear, but so cute kept them!",1
2,"This wallet is pretty puffy! I'm looking for a thin wallet I can stuff in my front pants pocket. This is too puffy by itself. WIth a few cards and money, it was way too big.",0
1,The tiara is small and made of metal. It hurt my daughters head and the seller would not accept a return. A more accurate rating would be in the negative.,0
5,My daughter loves them ü•∞,1
5,"Definitely worth the reduced price. I'm not really a bling type gal, but I like art deco and funky unusual things so these were the perfect gaudy accessory for me!",1
1,Had a strange smell. Had to return,0
5,Fits well and perfect for cold weather.,1
4,Tape is strong. looks exactly as pictured.,1
5,a nice gift for a friend,1
5,I like it,1
3,"I had my doubts these were real coach classes but was assured they were.  Their definitely not, the sides are so thin I‚Äôm afraid their going to break when I wear them. Very disappointed that I was mislead.",0
2,"Kind of expected a little bit more durability and better wear before holes appeared.  The sizings listed run small, I ordered an extra large, but unfortunately there's no larger options beyond that, so if you're less than a extra large you should be okay size wise. If not, expect them to be tight.  Not good combinations not to mention the pricing was a little bit high for three pairs, especially with the premature wearing occurring.  I'll most likely be looking elsewhere at different options for this pricing.",0
5,"I love these!! I am a server and I always wear skorts to work. The material feels and looks great. My favorite part is the pockets I use them mostly for cash or credit card and my morning pills. You could easily fit a phone on either side. I am a small large or medium depending on sizing. I do like mine to be tight, the material is soft and molds right to my body. They are minimally stretchy and keep things looking tight. My customers always compliment me when I wear them.  They think I am overdressed for work(lol). I tell them I am all dressed up cause I knew they were coming in. Also, they are truly high waisted. So I can tuck in my shirt and tie my apron at my waist. They are a decent length and so are the inside shorts. I prefer my skorts a little shorter but that is what makes them perfect for work. I highly recommend ordering from this seller. I have ordered 3 things  I love them all! Oh, I almost forgot they wash up awesome, not one spot. It's like they repel stains.",1
5,Was delivered timely..and has worked wonders on my Silver..thank you for a great product,1
5,Warm  hat,1
1,"Fabric isn't nice quality and if you have any sort of bust, don't bother.",0
5,Love the watch!,1
4,I am a size 11 but it came small. I should have gotten a size up. A bit uncomfortably but I guess I'll get used to it.,1
2,Quite a few flaws throughout the resin.,0
3,"I order an L, but is like a #6",0
3,"The rose gold set came with both earnings fitting the left ear only. Odd pair. Other than that, nice enough for the money.",0
4,Love the material! And the cut is really nice. Long but not too long.,1
4,"It is kind of large but I was expecting that, over all a great gift",1
2,The graphics are very nice but the pants run small.,0
1,"Not true to size.... Definitely order a size up. The colors are nice in person, the glitter doesn't show up as much as I thought it would.",0
5,I love it. Would recommend this product to anyone .,1
3,"the stone looks much smaller in person, although it is a very beautiful ring, the stone seems bigger in the picture, a little deceiving",0
4,Great work pants black size pants fit to size.,1
3,The size chart is misleading. I'm a female who ordered a mans medium and it fit quite snug when the size chart showed it should've fit atleast one size bigger than my actual size.. I'll be giving to my 28 year old niece who's a size 4.,0
3,HUGE is an understatement. Cute though,0
2,"Other reviews mentioned smell, so I thought that meant leather smell. I love the smell of leather so I was excited to receive this bag. After it arrived: Very little leather smell and LOTS of chemical/glue smell.  No label stating genuine leather. I think it is just cheap leather or leather like product glued onto suede.  Very disappointing. Cute design, but handles are not large enough to loop around elbow. I am returning this item.",0
5,I really like it and thank you,1
4,Love the color and design. I bought the 3 pack camo and I love the look of all of them. I wore one pair already and I can‚Äôt wait to wear the rest of them. I purchased Large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 190 pounds,1
3,"I returned his item because I did not like the fit. I like that the material was thin, but the bottem was to big.  Not like a pencil skirt should be. I was expecting spandex material but I would say felt more like cotton. Other than the bottem bigger to big I did like the skirt.  Would recommend for people with bigger thighs and calves.",0
3,"Love this get compliments however the eyes were busted out as if poked out, and the cord for the lights broke not long after.",0
4,"My daughter and I could not agree on an appropriate graduation dress and I felt that this one was a good compromise. Youthful enough, but not too revealing for a high school graduation. I was very leery from all the reviews and some of them were spot on....the chest (for anyone one with a smaller chest) it was too large and we needed to get that altered, and the hips were a bit too big but it wasn't overly noticeable (no alterations). She is 5'7"" and about 155 (we ordered a large) .....she looked beautiful! Even my 80 year old mother loved it!",1
1,gaudy,0
3,Pretty small in diameter. Like a dime.,0
5,Very nice.,1
4,"The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is because the box it shipped in was only slightly too small and created 4 corners on the brim where they were compressed against the sides of the box for shipping.  It is not extreme and will probably round itself out with some time and wear.  The hat looks just like the picture, the elastic sweatband keeps it snug on your head without being tight and the material feels sturdy.  Very happy with the hat overall.",1
5,I haven‚Äôt lost my gloves since buying this product...,1
4,"It is a beautiful color. the size is just a little small. I wish it was about 10 inches wide. I still use it and I plan to get a smaller billfold, I think that will help.so far it is a nice purse.( I also cut the strap shorter)",1
5,My daughter uses it for work for her name tag,1
3,"The dress arrived on time. The color was much darker and more teal than what was shown on the site. I was hoping it would be more blue like on the site, but that was okay. The dress was really large on me everywhere but in the arms, and I am plus-sized. If I‚Äôd gotten a size smaller, the arms would probably be too small. It was hard picking a size because I am plus-size in the hips and butt, but Misses sized in the bust, waist and shoulders...makes finding clothes that fit a real hassle. The company made it even harder by only showing cm instead of inches. It took a lot of searching online and calculating to find the right size and if I‚Äôd gotten the size closest to my cm, the arms would not have fit. Frustrating, for sure.  Still, I‚Äôm used to this problem so I went and wore it for Easter. The only other thing of note is that it was stained upon arrival, by the waist seam on my right side. Whatever has marred the material, it looks like it‚Äôs here to stay. I didn‚Äôt notice it until I was out the door heading for church. Sigh.",0
4,"Sturdy material and zippers , Picture is true to color.  Just as described. Wished it had credit card pockets. Very roomy.",1
5,"Great fabric, great color and quality. Worn by a very tall woman and it Still covers the derri√®re which she likes!",1
5,"I do very physical work outside and have destroyed numerous hats with sweat over the years. I sought out this specific &#34;model&#34; of flexfit after reading that it wicked sweat. I honestly didn't expect it to hold up to my days but I gotta say I'm impressed.<br /><br />Not only is there zero discoloration after 2 weeks of wear but it doesn't even appear wet while sweating in it (never penetrates the outer layer). It's a little thicker than a standard flexfit, just toeing the line on too thick but acceptable (and considering the moisture wicking it's worth the added thickness)",1
3,"Like the hook and loop (aka velcro) closure but my daughter pulls them off instantly, so they haven't got as much use.  The legs tops are a bit large, so I expect she will grow out of the foot/bottom before we can reasonably use them.  Maybe best sized for chubby babies with smaller feet (I have the reverse)",0
1,Do not buy!  Not saltwater resistant ...take a look in the pics!,0
5,Very good compression.  Would purchase again.,1
4,"The shirt is great, the fabric is sleek and stretchy. I ordered a size up to be sure this would fit and I am glad I did. This runs a little smaller than normal size. I wear a large and ordered and XL and it fit perfectly. It‚Äôs a great shirt, nice quality and beautiful print!",1
5,"I loved these.  The company gives wonderful customer service.  Very accommodating.  Thank you, JoyaGift!",1
5,thank you it fit like a glove. lol  My daughter was a hit at 80's dance week. God Bless :),1
2,"Cute cute cute, but sending back. I ordered according to measurements to chart best I could figure to no avail! Couldn‚Äôt even get it on. It literally was the size of a child‚Äôs shirt!",0
1,Ugly and huge for a size 6.,0
1,"THESE ARE TERRIBLE BRUSHES, WHAT ARE THEY FOR?  CERTAINLY NOT FOR HIGHTLIGHTS.",0
5,Perfect and comfortable from what my fiance says. Going to buy her more for sure!,1
2,The quality wasn't as good as it appeared and the fit was way too small,0
1,Don't buy this product it is entirely to damn small a 4x feels like a Xtra small the sizing is wayy off if you wear a md or lg you better get  5x it it still may be to small,0
5,My daughter needs this for a play that she is in and it is perfect! Exactly what we were looking for!!!,1
1,Do not buy this. Cheap made and they are HUGE hair sticks to it and it‚Äôs no where near water resistant.,0
5,"Very nice hoody fits me fine , but the arms are too long , really not a big problem , just wierd",1
5,Fit just right. Love the color.,1
1,Too small,0
3,"This set is beautiful! However, the post and earring backing are not stainless steel. My granddaughter loved them but they irritated her ears severely after 12 hours of wear. I kept them because she loves the necklace. She can only wear 100% stainless steel. These earrings must be a coating over some other metal.",0
1,"This is a cheap watch and is not water proof or water resistant as described. I had my watch on in the pool, it obviously<br />had moisture in it after swimming and then stopped working. It is not worth the money. It looks nice initially but is made cheap. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!",0
1,This apron was crafted with poor quality. I was not happy with the product that I received. There were holes in the fabric as if it had been previously sewed incorrectly. There was also a visible snag right in the front of the chef hat. I would not recommend ordering from here.,0
2,"Not quality of a $79 shirt!, outsourcing seems to be the American way. A shirt made in India I‚Äôm sure because of the low cost of labor and materials. However I was quite disappointed in the quality. I have purchased shirts from Malaysia etc. for $25 or less and had the same or better quality and fit. Quite disappointed.",0
1,It tarnished in 2-3 days! I have bought different brackets and last me a while. I  know this is cheap but this is cheap cheap. Skip it!,0
5,Perfect. Just as seen and expected. Would buy again.,1
5,Love this hat for summer.  Well made and just a tad larger than I'd expected which is very good.,1
1,"I ordered Mens XL, these are kids sizes.  Don't order they are false advertising.",0
3,"cute, comfy and accurate to the photo. I got the green color and love it. I got a medium and I am 5'7 135 lbs. I want to get the other colors now too! Update!  I ordered the beige color, which is not beige at all, its baby pink. I'm returning it. Lighter colors are way too see through. Black and green are cute and not as see through.",0
4,sadly its sooo true for me. at least I'm warning people in a humourous way!,1
1,It does‚Äôt work will come of with for eyelashes.,0
1,"You would have to be a size 14 or so to wear the 6XL... wow... I wear Old Navy size 18 jeans, at the widest part of my waist (so not on my hips), and I was still about EIGHT inches short when trying on the 6XL. Yikes.",0
3,The earings are beautiful but they are definitively not for women . They are small sized. They show good quality but I did buy them thinking of them as gifts for I was lead to believe they were for grown-up ladies.,0
